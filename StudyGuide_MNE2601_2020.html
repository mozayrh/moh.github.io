After completing this unit, you should be able to:<br> y explain the concept of emerging economies<br> y evaluate the opportunities and challenges facing BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, <br>South Africa) countries<br> y discuss the challenges facing small and medium enterprises in South Africa<br> y apply the values of ubuntu to entrepreneurship<br>INTRODUCTION <br>2The role of entrepreneurship and small businesses has been established mainly in the con -<br>text of mature economies such as Europe and the USA. What role does small businesses play <br>in younger economies? In this learning unit, we will explore the meaning of an emerging <br>economy and the role of entrepreneurship in these economies.<br>Activity  1.1:  Getting started<br>Before embarking on this module, we would like you to reflect on why you are taking this <br>module. If you are an entrepreneur or a small business owner, you will gain knowledge <br>on how to start your own business or improve your existing business. Go to myUnisa <br>and complete the self-assessment on getting started. <br>Study "Business case for entrepreneurship and small business in emerging econo -<br>mies" in your prescribed textbook.<br>1.1 DEFINING ENTREPRENEURSHIP<br>3Although there is no consensus among authors on what entrepreneurship really is, most <br>agree that it is an important economic factor. At an international level, many organisations <br>measure the social and economic indicators which constitute key data and knowledge to <br>assist government and organisations with valuable information that will assist in developing <br>our economies and societies. One of the most comprehensive efforts to collect comparative <br>international data on entrepreneurship research is the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor <br>2study. You can access the current and previous GEM reports on the following link: www.<br>gemconsortium.org.  <br>4Stokea and Wilson (2017:36) highlight the following definitions of entrepreneurship:<br> y Entrepreneurship  is a way of thinking, reasoning and acting that is opportunity <br>based, holistic in approach and leadership balanced. Entrepreneurship results in the <br>creation, enhancement realisation and renewal of value not just for the owners, but <br>for all participants and stakeholders.<br> y Entrepreneurship  is the process of creating something new of value by devoting <br>the necessary time and effort, assuming the accompanying financial, psychological <br>and social risks and receiving the resulting rewards of monetary and personal sat -<br>isfaction and independence.<br> y Entrepreneurship  is an emergent process of recognising and communicating crea -<br>tivity so that the resulting economic value can be appropriated by those involved.<br>5The above definitions show that entrepreneurship consists of the following:<br> y The identification, evaluation and exploitation of an opportunity<br> y The management of a new or transformed organisation so as to facilitate the produc -<br>tion and consumption of new goods and services<br> y The creation of value through the successful exploitation of a new idea (requires <br>both creativity and innovation)<br>6Entrepreneurship does not only apply to small enterprises, but it can take place in a wide <br>variety of contexts. Now that you have the idea of what entrepreneurship is, let’s move on <br>to define emerging economies.<br>Activity  1.2<br>Give your own definition of entrepreneurship from what you have learnt. Is there such <br>a thing as African entrepreneurship? Discuss. Go to myUnisa where you will discuss this <br>with your fellow students.<br>1.2 DEFINING EMERGING ECONOMIES<br>7There are many different interpretations of what an emerging economy is. Emerging econo -<br>mies are sometimes described as transitional economies that are emerging as they struggle <br>to catch up to the Western world.<br>8A good indicator of a growing economy is an increase in the small business population as <br>seen in China and India. China emerged from the economic disasters of the Cultural Revolu -<br>tion, from 1978, when party leaders decided to undertake gradual reform of the system by <br>increasing the role of market mechanisms within a controlled communist state. In 2013, small <br>and medium enterprises’ (SMEs) contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP) in China <br>was 60 per cent and provided 80 per cent of the jobs (Stokes & Wilson, 2017:19). <br> 3 MNE2601/19India initially put faith in its public sector to tackle its huge poverty problems after it gained <br>independence in 1947 . The New Industrial Policy of 1991 encouraged the private sector, <br>thereby liberalising the economy and allowing entrepreneurs to flourish. SMEs now contrib -<br>ute 40 per cent of India’s GDP and they are the second-largest source of employment after <br>agriculture (Stokes & Wilson, 2017:19).<br>Activity  1.3<br>Work through section 1.2 of your prescribed textbook on emerging economies. How <br>would you define South Africa as an emerging economy? Go to myUnisa and discuss <br>with your fellow students.<br>1.3 CHALLENGES FACED BY ENTREPRENEURS AND SMALL <br>BUSINESS OWNERS IN SOUTH AFRICA<br>10You need to have an understanding of the state of entrepreneurship and small businesses in <br>South Africa and the challenges faced by SMEs in South Africa. After reading section 1.3 and <br>1.4 of your prescribed textbook, you should be able to identify the challenges faced by SMEs <br>and think of possible solutions to overcome these challenges. Take note of the discussion <br>on the informal sector and the role of entrepreneurship education in your considerations.<br>1Assignment 1<br>Discuss how you can integrate the values of ubuntu in entrepreneurship. <br>1.4 SOUTH AFRICAN POSITION WITHIN BRICS<br>2Read section 1.6 in your prescribed textbook and take note of the reasons why <br>South Africa should be part of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa (BRICS) and <br>the reasons against being part of BRICS. You need to evaluate the opportunities <br>and challenges that exist among these trade partners. <br>1.5 OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN EMERGING <br>ECONOMIES<br>11Now that we have discussed the case for entrepreneurship in emerging economies, what <br>are the challenges that entrepreneurs face in these economies? As a student of this module, <br>whenever you see challenges you need to start thinking of possible solutions to overcome <br>these challenges. This reflects an entrepreneurial mindset that is always seeking opportunity <br>where others see problems. <br>4CONCLUSION<br>12In this learning unit, you were introduced to the concept of emerging economies in terms <br>of the BRICS countries. As South Africa is an emerging economy, we need to understand <br>entrepreneurship in emerging economies and how to take advantages of the opportunities <br>that exist in that particular context in order to further develop our economy. <br>Useful terms <br>It is useful for you to know the following important terms and their meaning as they are <br>used in this module.<br> y entrepreneurship y BRICS y SME  y emerging economy y entrepreneurship education<br>1ASSESSMENT <br>After working through this learning unit, you should be able to answer the questions at the end <br>of the chapter in your prescribed textbook. You will find more practise questions on myUnisa.<br>13<br> 5 MNE2601/1Learning unit 2<br>Small businesses in emerging economies<br>AIM<br>14The aim of this topic is for you to explore the nature of small businesses in emerging econo -<br>mies. After completing this unit, you should be able to:<br> y define the small business in your own context<br> y discuss the role of small businesses in emerging economies<br> y identify small business startup categories in South Africa<br> y identify ideas for small business startups in emerging economies<br> y explain the factors contributing to failure in emerging economies<br>INTRODUCTION<br>15Emerging economies create opportunities for the development of new small businesses. <br>Although it is accepted that small businesses contribute to the economy of South Africa as in <br>other BRICS countries, small businesses continue to face a myriad of challenges that threaten <br>their growth and sustainability. This learning unit will focus on the role of small businesses in <br>the economy, factors that lead to failure, different categories of small businesses and ideas <br>for small business startups in an emerging economy like ours.<br>Activity  2.1:  Small business ideas<br>Before continuing with this learning unit, take a moment to think about ideas that you <br>may want to explore should you start your own small business. Are the ideas new or ex -<br>isting, are they feasible, would they make a successful new business, what are the odds <br>of failure? Go to myUnisa and share your views with your fellow students.<br>Study "Small business startups in emerging economies" in your prescribed textbook.<br>2.1 DEFINING SMALL BUSINESSES<br>16Although there is no consensus among authors on what a small business really is, most agree <br>that it is an important economic factor. The term small business implies that small businesses <br>have certain characteristics and management issues in common that distinguish them from <br>larger organisations. Small businesses do not conform to any neat parameters and much <br>depends on the industry in which they operate and the personalities and aspirations of those <br>that run them (Stokes & Wilson, 2017:3). <br>617Small businesses are sometimes defined quantitatively, this means that numerical param -<br>eters are used to differentiate between smaller and larger organisations. These parameters <br>include number of employees, turnover and gross assets. Refer to your prescribed textbook <br>to see how the National Small Business Act classifies small businesses according to the above <br>parameters. Non-quantitative factors have also been proposed to try to single out differen -<br>tiating characteristics of small businesses. According to Stokes and Wilson (2017:5), a small <br>business is said to have the following characteristics:<br> y is managed by its owner in a personalised way<br> y has a relatively small share of the market in economic terms<br> y is independent, does not form part of a larger enterprise and its ownership is rela -<br>tively free from outside control in its principal decisions<br>18The above is, however, not true for all small businesses, and scholars still find it problematic <br>to define a small business. In South Africa the Small Business Act differentiates between a <br>survivalist, micro-enterprise, very small, small and medium enterprise. Work through the <br>definitions of these in your prescribed textbook.<br>Activity  2.2<br>Give your own definition of a small business. Do you think it is enough to have only one <br>definition of a small business? Discuss. Go to myUnisa to discuss this with your fellow <br>students.<br>After working through section 2.4 of your prescribed textbook. Explain the role of small <br>businesses in emerging economies.<br>2.2 SMALL BUSINESS STARTUP CATEGORIES<br>19There is no ideal form of business ownership as a lot of factors determine the form that is <br>best suited for your small business. For example, whether you go into business alone or with <br>someone else, influences your choice of business ownership.<br>3Study the section on the different forms of small businesses that you can register <br>in South Africa. Pay attention to the advantages and disadvantages of each.<br>Activity  2.3<br>Compare and contrast two forms of business ownership. Which form would you choose <br>for your business startup and why?<br> 7 MNE2601/12.3 CHALLENGES IN SMALL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS<br>20The small business does not exist in isolation of the wider economic environment; therefore, a <br>number of outside influences sometimes pose challenges for the small business in an emerg -<br>ing economy. It is important to note that the small business does not have direct control over <br>the macro environment in particular, although it has a direct effect on the wellbeing of a <br>small business. Therefore, small business owners or managers need to be aware of the fac -<br>tors that affect their business and be able to deal with the threats they bring to the business.<br>21Section 2.7 .1 in your prescribed textbook highlights a number of challenges experienced by <br>small businesses in the macro environment. Read through these and come up with possible <br>strategies that can help the small business overcome these challenges.<br>CONCLUSION<br>22In this learning unit, small businesses in an emerging economy were discussed. The differ -<br>ent factors that lead to failure, the factors in the macro environment that act as a challenge <br>to the survival of small businesses as well as the different forms of ownership that a small <br>business can take were discussed. It is important to put the small business in the context of <br>an emerging economy so that we can begin to address specific challenges and ensure small <br>business sustainability.<br>Useful terms <br>It is useful for you to know the following important terms and their meanings as they <br>are used in this module.<br> y small business y legal personality y macro environment y startup failure y limited liability<br>4ASSESSMENT<br>After working through this learning unit, you should be able to answer the questions at the end <br>of the chapter in your prescribed textbook. You will find more practice questions on myUnisa.<br>23<br>8Learning unit 3<br>Feasibility analysis for small businesses within <br>emerging economies<br>AIM<br>24The aim of this topic is for you to be able to conduct a feasibility study and be able to identify <br>elements that are unique to emerging economies. After completing this unit you should be <br>able to:<br> y explain the importance of a feasibility study<br> y discuss the elements of a feasibility study<br> y conduct a feasibility study on any idea or business<br> y explain the entrepreneurial success factors for emerging economies<br> y discuss networking and collaboration<br>INTRODUCTION <br>25To survive in the marketplace, the entrepreneur needs different types of information depend -<br>ing on the stage of development of the business. For a startup the most crucial question <br>is whether there is sufficient market demand for the new product or service to enable the <br>enterprise to establish itself as a viable business. In conjunction with conducting the feasibil -<br>ity study, an entrepreneur needs to know the environment in which their business will be <br>operating and what the essential factors are that contribute to a successful business. In con -<br>ducting a feasibility study, the entrepreneur needs to take into consideration success factors <br>and challenges applicable to their business idea and the environment they find themselves in. <br>Activity  3.1:  Getting started<br>Read the case study “Opportunities created by crime” in your prescribed textbook and <br>evaluate the feasibility analysis of AGV Security Services. <br>Study "Feasibility analysis for small businesses within emerging economies AND <br>Essential success factors in entrepreneurship for emerging economies" in your <br>prescribed textbook.<br> 9 MNE2601/13.1 WHY A FEASIBILITY STUDY<br>26Stokes and Wilson (2017:146), highlight the importance of a feasibility study to develop and <br>confirm a strategy for market entry based on the identifiable needs of the target customer <br>group. A feasibility study also seeks to provide credibility to outside backers and financiers in <br>order to convince them that the new venture is founded on the realities of the marketplace, <br>not just the dreams of the entrepreneur. <br>27A product/service feasibility study can take the form of screenshots of a new website, to a <br>physical model of a new product design or prototype. The purpose here is to learn how close <br>the new product/service is to adding sufficient value to a potential customer to make them <br>want to buy it. This will enable the entrepreneur to make decisions on whether the product/<br>service needs modification or drastic changes to the idea, or whether the entrepreneur can <br>go ahead with the concept unchanged, or should abandon the idea altogether. <br>28Industry and market feasibility analysis refers to information about existing and potential <br>customers, trends in the market sector and competition. This includes information such as <br>who the direct competitors are, profitability of the industry, the size of the target market, the <br>characteristics of existing and potential customers, and whether there are any substitutes <br>for the product or service.<br>29The entrepreneur needs to take into consideration the technical and legal implications that an idea <br>can have so that they can operate according to accepted standards and within legal parameters. <br>5Read section 3.4 in your prescribed textbook on some of the aspects pertaining <br>the above.<br>30Financial feasibility will give the entrepreneur information on whether the business will be <br>financially viable to start. Is the financial return on the business worth the risk (financial), time <br>and effort that the entrepreneur must invest in order to get the business up and running?<br>6Read the section on organisational feasibility in your prescribed textbook. Please <br>note that this section is related to the success factors discussed in the following <br>chapter of the prescribed textbook.<br>31After completing this section, you should be able to do your own or another business’s <br>feasibility study and determine whether the business will be a profitable one or not. In the <br>next section, we look at the success factors and challenges that the entrepreneur needs to <br>consider when conducting a feasibility study. The emerging market’s uniqueness requires <br>entrepreneurs to learn or possess certain enabling attributes and tools to successfully navi -<br>gate their business environment. Also take note of the different research methods that you <br>can use in the feasibility study. <br>10Activity  3.2<br>What are the unique aspects that entrepreneurs can take advantage of in the African <br>business environment? Discuss. Go to myUnisa to discuss this with your fellow students.<br>3.2 OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES OF  <br>ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN SOUTH AFRICA<br>32Work through this section in your prescribed textbook to get a sense of what differentiates <br>an emerging economy from a more developed one in terms of the opportunities and chal -<br>lenges that an entrepreneur needs to consider before embarking on a new business venture. <br>33After studying this section, you should be able to incorporate the above in your feasibility study.<br>Activity  3.3<br>Discuss entrepreneurial management and leadership in the small business venture and <br>how you can apply it in your own business or business idea. Go to myUnisa and discuss <br>this with your fellow students.<br>3.3 MANAGEMENT AND LEADERSHIP KNOWLEDGE<br>34Management in a small business is important as in most instances the small business owner <br>is also the manager of the business, especially for a business in its startup and early stages. <br>The small business manager needs to have knowledge on how to manage people in their <br>business, finances and resources, risk management and change management, among other <br>management functions. Read more on these functions in your prescribed textbook. For the <br>small business owner, this can be daunting as no manager can be an expert in all fields, often <br>with limited resources, especially in an emerging economy, hence the need for advice and <br>training (Stokes & Wilson, 2017:345).<br>Activity  3.4<br>Study the section on resource dependency theory and relationship management in your <br>prescribed textbook and identify the assets or organisational capabilities that can help <br>an enterprise realise a competitive edge. Add your own assets and resource capabilities <br>to the ones mentioned.<br> 11  MNE2601/13.4 NETWORKING AND COLLABORATION<br>35An entrepreneur can benefit from networking and collaboration, which entail support, col -<br>laboration with other organisations and assistance from local institutions. Small business <br>managers can overcome resource constraints through networking by acquiring and locating <br>essential resources. The ability to scan the external environment for opportunities is also <br>maintained through networking. In this case they know their customers well, keep an eye <br>on competitive activity and become aware of underlying trends that may affect their busi -<br>ness (Stokes & Wilson, 2017:147). It is important for an entrepreneur to keep on searching the <br>environment for opportunities and threats that may be detrimental to their business. One of <br>the ways in which they can do this is through networking and collaboration. <br>Study the section on networking and collaboration in your prescribed textbook. <br>Also take note of negotiation skills and relationship management and how an <br>entrepreneur can use these skills in managing a sustainable business.<br>CONCLUSION<br>36In this learning unit, you learned why an entrepreneur needs to conduct a feasibility study <br>and the different aspects to do a feasibility study on before exploring an idea. We also looked <br>at the success factors entrepreneurs need to keep in mind to exploit any idea or opportunity <br>with knowledge. Entrepreneurs and small business owners and managers need to know the <br>importance of management leadership and knowledge, as well as networking and collabora -<br>tion when pursuing their opportunities in order to run successful businesses.<br>Useful terms <br>It is useful for you to know the following important terms and their meanings as they <br>are used in this module.<br> y concept test y feasibility analysis y entrepreneurial collaboration y negotiation y entrepreneurship essentials<br>7ASSESSMENT <br>After working through this learning unit, you should be able to answer the questions at the end <br>of the chapter in your prescribed textbook.

After completing this unit, you should be able to:<br> y categorise the general challenges associated with starting a business in an emerg -<br>ing economy<br> y discuss the challenges when evaluating a business opportunity<br> y explain managerial skills shortage as a challenge when starting a small business<br> y evaluate the financial challenges of starting a business in an emerging economy<br> y discuss the marketing challenges of starting a new business in an emerging economy<br>INTRODUCTION <br>38There are many challenges that the entrepreneur or small business owner faces once they <br>have started operating their business. Once a business is established, it is vulnerable to cir -<br>cumstances that are, sometimes, beyond its control, both externally and internally. As much <br>as small businesses are important to an economy, they still fail within the first few years of <br>operation. By being aware of the challenges of starting a small business, entrepreneurs can <br>be better prepared to face any challenges they may face and come up with strategies to <br>counter the negative effects of these challenges. This learning unit focuses on the general <br>challenges, managerial skills challenges, marketing challenges and financial challenges that <br>small businesses in emerging economies encounter. <br>Activity  4.1<br>If you are the owner of a small business, discuss the challenges that you have faced or <br>continue to face in managing your business. Discuss this with your fellow students on <br>myUnisa.<br>Study the chapter “Challenges of starting a business in an emerging economy”, in <br>your prescribed textbook.<br> 13  MNE2601/14.1 GENERAL CHALLENGES<br>39According to Raj (2016), many factors such as limited access to information, procedures, gov -<br>ernment rules and regulations, finance, skills and expertise and, most importantly, guidance <br>pose a major threat to the growth of an enterprise and this, in-turn, affects the economy. In a <br>country like India, employment stability and the attraction of being associated with a brand <br>of a big company continues to be the dream of many of the younger generation and this <br>culture continues to hamper their entrepreneurial intentions. Unless this attitude changes, the <br>government will have limited scope in doing what it should in order to support the number <br>of entrepreneurial ventures in the country. <br>Activity  4.2<br>Read the case study below and identify the challenges small businesses face in South <br>Africa. Go to myUnisa and discuss this with your fellow students.<br>Case study<br>SME REGULATION WOES IN SOUTH AFRICA<br>Although the South African government recognises the need to encourage entre -<br>preneurship in order to create economic growth, the SME sector is actually declining. <br>The 2013 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) report statistics indicate that small <br>businesses are closing down at a faster rate than new ones are being formed; only <br>10.6% of South Africa’s adult population is involved in early-stage entrepreneurship, <br>while 3% operate established small businesses, putting the country in the bottom <br>four globally for entrepreneurial activity. (In contrast, for example, 17% of Brazilians <br>are active in early-stage entrepreneurship and 15% operate established firms.) <br>According to Small Business Project (SBP) Alert (2014), the burden of regulation is <br>a key factor. Frequent changes in the regulatory environment, the need to keep <br>track of overlapping and, sometimes, conflicting regulatory requirements across <br>multiple departments and levels of government, poor communication and access <br>to information, as well as administrative inefficiencies in government departments <br>and municipalities, mean that the SME owner spends a disproportionate amount <br>of time dealing with regulatory compliance. <br>Small firms spend an average of eight working days (75 hours) a month dealing with <br>red tape. This regulatory compliance is estimated to cost SMEs R216 000 per year, <br>plus a further R21 000 to comply with tax requirements. Business owners identified <br>labour issues as one of their top red tape headaches; small firms can spend up to 1 1 <br>days per case at the Council for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) to <br>resolve a dispute and the average SME is taken to the CCMA twice a year.<br>Source:  Stokes and Wilson (2017:91)<br>144.2 FINANCIAL CHALLENGES<br>40When it comes to finances, the major challenges for small businesses in emerging economies <br>is not only lack of funds, but also the awareness of the sources of funds. Study the source of <br>funds for South African SMEs in your prescribed textbook.<br>41Many entrepreneurs also lack financial management knowledge, which sometimes leads to <br>the mishandling of funds in the business, making it difficult to continue operating. <br>4.3 MANAGERIAL SKILLS SHORTAGE<br>42Entrepreneurs and small business managers do not only need entrepreneurial skills and <br>characteristics in order to run successful businesses. Managerial skills are also an important <br>requirement to manage a small business and many small business owners in emerging <br>economies lack managerial skills. It is important for small business managers to attend train -<br>ing in the skills that they lack so that they are better equipped to manage their businesses.<br>4.4 MARKETING SKILLS SHORTAGE<br>43Over and above managerial skills, entrepreneurs and small business managers need to market <br>their products and services and the type of marketing they use can contribute to the success <br>of their business. In the age of the internet and social media, small business managers need <br>to keep abreast with new and effective ways of reaching their customers. The information <br>gathered in the feasibility study will assist the small business manager to develop an appro -<br>priate marketing strategy for the kind of customers they are targeting.<br>Activity  4.3<br>Study the section on, “Challenges when evaluating a new business opportunity in an <br>emerging economy”, in your textbook, and link it to the feasibility study in learning unit <br>3. Share your findings with your fellow students on myUnisa.<br>CONCLUSION<br>44In this learning unit, you learned about the challenges entrepreneurs have to face in emerg -<br>ing economies when they start their business operations. These challenges are unique to <br>a number of emerging economies globally, but are not uncommon. We discussed general <br>challenges, financial challenges, the lack of managerial and marketing skills and the challenges <br>faced when evaluating a new business opportunity. As a student in entrepreneurship, you <br>need to take time and reflect on these changes and come up with possible solutions that <br>can make the entrepreneurial environment less challenging. <br> 15  MNE2601/1Useful terms <br>It is useful for you to know the following important terms and their meanings, as they <br>are used in this module:<br> y financial challenges y general challenges y marketing skills shortage y lack of managerial skills<br>8 ASSESSMENT<br>After working through this learning unit, you should be able to answer the questions at the end <br>of the chapter in your prescribed textbook. You will find more practice questions on myUnisa.<br>45<br>16Learning unit 5<br>Strategic planning in small businesses<br>AIM<br>46The aim of this topic is for you to explore strategic planning in small businesses in emerging <br>economies. After completing this unit, you should be able to:<br> y define strategic planning in the small business context<br> y explain the importance of strategic planning for a small business<br> y discuss the different types of strategic planning and approaches to strategic planning<br> y explain the strategy-as-practice approach<br> y discuss strategy implementation<br> y evaluate entrepreneurial growth strategies<br>INTRODUCTION <br>47Strategy is commonly associated with large organisations, but strategic decisions have been <br>found to be just as significant to the success of small enterprises. In this learning unit, we <br>will discuss strategic planning and its importance for a small business; the different types <br>and approaches to planning; strategy-as-practice; strategy implementation as well as a few <br>entrepreneurial growth strategies. Entrepreneurs and small business managers need to <br>know that growth does not happen naturally and having a strategy in place can help a small <br>business become successful.<br>Activity  5.1<br>What do you think is meant by “strategy” in the small business context? What would be <br>the main ingredients of a small business strategy?<br>Study the chapter “Strategic Planning” AND section 15.6 on “Strategic Planning” <br>in your prescribed textbook.<br>5.1 DEFINING STRATEGY<br>48The origins of strategy are based on warfare and business strategy originated in the early <br>1960s, when Igor Ansoff (1965) and others advocated extensive research and information <br>gathering as the precursor to strategy formulation.<br> 17  MNE2601/149A strategy is now defined as the actions a company takes to achieve one or more of its goals <br>through either a plan, pattern, ploy, perspective or position. Strategic thinking synthesises <br>the creativity and intuition of the entrepreneur into a vision for the future, suggesting that <br>creativity and strategy have more in common than people think (Stokes & Wilson, 2017:218). <br>This definition implies that an entrepreneur needs to have a plan for the future and has to <br>begin to mobilise resources and scan the environment in order to achieve that plan.<br>50Strategic planning can also be defined according to the process that an entrepreneur or small <br>business manager needs to follow in order to achieve their goals for the business. Study this <br>process in section 7 .1 of your prescribed textbook.<br>Activity  5.2<br>Give your own definition of strategy based on what you have studied. How relevant is <br>strategy in small businesses? Go to myUnisa and discuss this with your fellow students.<br>.<br>5.2 STRATEGIC PLANNING TYPES<br>51There are different ways in which a firm can decide to approach strategic planning. This <br>largely depends on the type of enterprise, the environment in which they find themselves <br>and the available resources, among other factors. <br>Study the section on the different types of planning, by Mintzberg and Waters, in <br>your prescribed textbook. <br>52Choose one of the types of planning and apply it to a business enterprise of your choice. In your <br>studying of this section, also take note of the benefits and advantages of strategic planning.<br>53Strategic planning in a small business can either be formal or informal and there are many <br>different reasons for this. You need to know the benefits of both formal and informal planning. <br>Another approach to strategic planning is the strategy-as-practice approach, which focuses <br>more on the actual day-to-day activities that contribute to strategic planning. It is easier to <br>link these micro processes to strategic planning in smaller enterprises. <br>9Read through the section, “Strategic planning template”, and take note of the stra -<br>tegic planning template given in your prescribed textbook (figure 7 .1 AND  t able  7.1).<br>Activity  5.3<br>Work through section 7.3.1.1 of your prescribed textbook AND  distinguish between <br>formal and informal planning. Go to myUnisa and discuss this with your fellow students.<br>185.3 STRATEGIC PLANNING ISSUES<br>54As much as the entrepreneur or small business manager can plan, there tends to be issues <br>in strategic planning. Sometimes, due to circumstances beyond the control of the small <br>business manager, intended strategies do not work out as planned and they have to con -<br>tinuously adapt to their changing situation. Study the strategic planning issues given in your <br>prescribed textbook and focus on implementation as one of the issues mentioned. A small <br>business manager can have a great strategy, but, if implementation is not done properly, <br>they risk failure of the strategy. Strategy evaluation and control are also important, so that the <br>entrepreneur or small business manager can keep track of the progress in order to achieve <br>operational and organisational goals. <br>5.4 GROWTH STRATEGIES<br>55Small enterprises can sometimes adopt survival strategies, which means their goal is not to <br>grow, but to keep the business alive. Sometimes, they adopt growth strategies, which are <br>discussed in your textbook. Study the different internal and external entrepreneurial growth <br>strategies.<br>Activity  5.4<br>Read the case study below and answer the questions that follow. Share your answers <br>with fellow students on myUnisa.<br>Case study<br>SEEING AHEAD<br>Tebogo was 22 years old when she set up her company in her parents’ back room. <br>It all started when her eyesight started changing and she realised she needed some <br>reading glasses. On visiting the local optician, Tebogo was astonished to find the <br>prescribed glasses would cost R2 100. As a student, this was not affordable. Tebogo <br>was prompted to do some research and she discovered that her R2 100 glasses only <br>cost R100 to make. She realised she could make glasses for a fraction of the price <br>charged by high-street retailers (who collectively held a 70 per cent share of the <br>market). She set about learning how to carry out optometric testing and cutting <br>lenses. Within the first year of setting up her new business, Glasses Direct has sold <br>over 22 000 pairs.<br>Adapted from:  Stokes and Wilson (2017:220)<br>(1) What factors influenced Tebogo’s decision to set up a glasses business?<br>(2) When Tebogo realised she could produce glasses more cheaply, what did she do next?<br>(3) If you were in Tebogo’s position, what resources would you call upon to help you set <br>up your own glasses business? Also, what would you do to acquire the resources you <br>don’t already have at your disposal?<br> 19  MNE2601/1CONCLUSION<br>56In this learning unit, you were introduced to the concept of strategy and strategic planning. It <br>is important to understand the purpose of strategic planning and how a small enterprise can <br>go about formulating a strategic plan. The different types and approaches to strategic plan -<br>ning were also discussed, including the importance of implementation, evaluation and control. <br>Useful terms <br>It is useful for you to know the following important terms and their meaning, as they are <br>used in this module:<br> y strategic planning y strategy-as-practice y strategy implementation y growth strategies<br>10ASSESSMENT <br>After working through this learning unit, you should be able to answer the questions at the end <br>of the chapter in your prescribed textbook.

After completing this unit, you should be able to:<br> y describe creativity and innovation<br> y develop and improve creativity to excel in entrepreneurial venturing and small busi -<br>ness management<br> y assess the likely commercial success of a new idea or innovation<br> y explain creativity and innovation as critical elements for entrepreneurial success<br> y identify the misconceptions about creativity and innovation and their impact on <br>entrepreneurship<br> y discuss the tools for creativity and innovation<br> y explain how an entrepreneur can lead and manage innovation in their business<br>INTRODUCTION <br>58In this learning unit, we examine entrepreneurship by focusing on creativity and innovation. <br>The focus is on how we describe creativity and innovation and the types of creativity that <br>an entrepreneur or small business manager can explore. Myths and misconceptions about <br>innovation can hinder entrepreneurs and small business managers from being innovative; <br>therefore, they need to be aware of these myths, and avoid these traps to advance their <br>businesses by being innovative. The role of the entrepreneur in innovation is important as <br>they have to act as leaders and managers of innovation.<br>Activity  6.1<br>Do you have an innovative idea? Go to myUnisa and share your ideas with your fellow <br>students.<br>Study section 9.3 “Innovation” in your prescribed textbook.<br>6.1 DEFINING CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION<br>59The terms innovation and creativity are often used interchangeably, however, in the context <br>of entrepreneurship, it is important to distinguish between them. Stokes and Wilson (2017:1 12) <br>define them as follows:<br> 21  MNE2601/160Creativity  – is the generation of new and valuable ideas<br>61Innovation  – is the successful exploitation of new and valuable ideas<br>62The process of entrepreneurship relies on the creativity of individuals, who come up with <br>original ideas for new products and services. However, entrepreneurship also involves suc -<br>cessful exploitation of these ideas, which is identified as innovation. Innovation plays an <br>important role in maintaining the competitiveness of a business. <br>11Study the section on “Innovation and why it matters”, in your prescribed textbook, <br>and pay special attention to innovation in an emerging market context.<br>6.2 MYTHS AND MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT INNOVATION<br>63Innovation is often misunderstood. Your prescribed textbook describes some myths and <br>misconceptions about innovation. Below, we discuss some of the misconceptions about <br>innovation that are not mentioned in your prescribed textbook.<br>Innovation = invention<br>Innovation is strongly linked to invention, but they are not the same. An invention is <br>essentially a creative idea, while innovation takes that idea and puts it to work (Stokes <br>& Wilson, 2017:1 14).<br>Innovation = new products or services only<br>Innovation may result in new products and services, but it is not limited to new product <br>development. Five types of innovation through which an entrepreneur can change a <br>market have been identified and these are:<br> y new products or services or a new quality of existing products or services<br> y the introduction of a new method of production<br> y the opening of a new market<br> y the conquest of a new source of supply of raw materials or half-manufactured <br>goods<br> y the carrying out of the new organisation of any industry<br>64Innovation can also be related to new markets , that is, taking existing products or services <br>and selling them into new markets. Small businesses often have the advantage of spotting <br>markets that have been overlooked by larger organisations. An entrepreneur can also be in -<br>novative by coming up with new marketing methods  – the product or service remains the <br>same and the market does not change. The innovation can be in the marketing of the product <br>to the consumer. An enterprise can innovate in how it operates by finding new methods of <br>operating , either through changes in its production methods or its systems or in its way of <br>doing business or by developing new ways of making goods and services available to the <br>customer (Stokes & Wilson, 2017:1 16).<br>Innovation = once-off inspiration<br>Innovation does not rely on a sudden flash of inspiration, but is, rather, a gradual pro -<br>cess, which builds into something new over a period of time. <br>22Activity  6.2<br>Explain the myths and misconceptions of innovation. Go to myUnisa and discuss this <br>with your fellow students.<br>65After working through section 9.3.4 of your prescribed textbook, go to myUnisa and discuss <br>the different types of innovation with your fellow students. <br>66Study the whole of section 9.4, in your prescribed textbook. Note the role of the entrepreneur <br>in the business.<br>6.3 CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION TOOLS<br>67To be conducive to creativity and innovation, an environment must have many different <br>sources of mental stimulation including other people and things. There are hundreds of <br>techniques and tools that are available for use by the entrepreneur. If you go to the internet, <br>you will find many different tools for creativity and innovation.<br>Activity  6.3 <br>Discuss the different types of tools that one can use to be creative and innovative. Can <br>creativity be taught? Share your views with fellow students on myUnisa.<br>Study the section on “South Africa National Innovation Ecosystem” in your pre -<br>scribed book. <br>Pay special attention to the process of pitching your idea to potential stakeholders or <br>investors. Every entrepreneur and small business needs to know how to sell their idea, <br>be it to get funding or support for exploiting the idea and bringing it to the market.<br>6.4 LEADING AND MANAGING INNOVATION<br>68As an entrepreneur or small business manager, the burden is on you to lead the enterprise <br>when it comes to creativity and innovation. When an innovation is introduced, one cannot <br>leave it  up to fate and hope for the best outcome, but, to see success, you must manage <br>the innovation. A number of variables have an impact on how small enterprises manage in -<br>novation, such as skills level capacity, research and development activities and whether the <br>business environment is generally receptive to new innovations. <br> 23  MNE2601/1CONCLUSION<br>69In this learning unit, we explored the concept of innovation and creativity and the role it plays <br>in entrepreneurship and small business management. Entrepreneurs need to be aware of what <br>their options are when exploiting creative ideas and what they need to do to manage their <br>innovations. It is also important to understand what innovation is and what it is not. Lastly, <br>to be successful, entrepreneurs need knowledge about how to manage their innovations <br>and they have to be aware of environmental constraints that can affect their innovations. <br>Useful terms <br>It is useful for you to know the following important terms and their meanings, as they <br>are used in this module.<br> y creativity y innovation y innovation misconceptions y innovation ecosystem y innovation management<br>12ASSESSMENT <br>After working through this learning unit, you should be able to answer the questions at the end <br>of the chapter in your prescribed textbook. You will find more practice questions on myUnisa.<br>24Learning unit 7<br>Ethics, governance and sustainability<br>AIM<br>70The aim of this topic is for you to explore ethics, governance and sustainability in entrepre -<br>neurship and small business management in emerging economies. After completing this <br>unit, you should be able to:<br> y share the importance of ethics in a small business<br> y support governance structures to a small business<br> y defend legislation that relates to ethical conduct in business<br> y judge measures that encourage ethical behaviour in a business<br> y support the measures of business sustainability <br>INTRODUCTION <br>71Ethical conduct is of utmost importance when running a successful business. Ethics refer to <br>the moral principles that guide a person’s behaviour. However, ethics is equally important in <br>the business world and it should guide how a business conducts its affairs. A business needs <br>to have a standpoint on what they deem as right or wrong in their dealings both internally <br>and with external stakeholders. In this learning unit, we will look at the importance of busi -<br>ness ethics and its role in small businesses, especially in emerging economies, and how <br>governance can be applied in small businesses. We will also look at sustainability and how <br>a small business, as it is critical to any economy, can become sustainable. <br>Activity  7.1:  Ethics in business<br>What do you understand by the term “ethics in business” and how does it apply to small <br>businesses? Go to myUnisa and complete the self-assessment on ethics in business. <br>Study “Ethics, governance and sustainability” in your prescribed textbook.<br>7.1 IMPORTANCE OF ETHICS IN BUSINESS <br>72Business ethics or corporate ethics are often used to describe the application of ethical values <br>to business activities. This applies to all aspects of conduct  by a business and its representa -<br>tives. There are factors which are discussed in your prescribed textbook that could constitute <br>ethical factors in business. Study these and see if you can think of other factors that you <br>would consider important ethical issues in a business.<br> 25  MNE2601/1Activity  7. 2<br>What other factors constitute ethics in a business? Go to myUnisa and discuss your <br>thoughts with your fellow students.<br>7. 2 ETHICS AND LAW<br>73Law and ethics are not the same thing, although both exist in order to influence behaviour. <br>The following table highlights the differences between ethics and law.<br>Tab le  7.1:  Differences between ethics and law <br>74(Adapted from: Crane & Matten 2016:6)<br>Ethics Law <br>Adhering to an ethical code is voluntary Law is mandatory<br>Ethics speak to what is right, good and just Laws define what is permissible<br>Individuals are responsible for clarifying mean -<br>ing in any ambiguous ethical situation that <br>may ariseLawyers and judges are responsible for clarify -<br>ing meaning where there is ambiguity or when <br>a matter is subject to interpretation <br>Ethics do not usually have any punishment for <br>violationLaw carries punishment for violation<br>Ethics are rules of conduct Laws are ruled developed by governments to <br>provide balance in society and protection of <br>citizens<br>75In organisations, employees can look to the code of ethics or the statement of values for <br>guidance on how to handle ethically gray areas. Even when an individual has a clear sense <br>of right and wrong, or good and bad, it can be difficult to know what is ethical in a given <br>situation. In addition, there are times when people believe that the ends justify the means. <br>In other words, if the result of an action is good, then it is okay if the action itself is unethical. <br>Most ethical decisions exist in a gray area – where there is no clear-cut or obvious decision <br>that can be determined solely through quantitative analysis or consideration of objective <br>data or information (Crane & Matten, 2016:4). Ethical decision making requires judgment and <br>interpretation, the application of a set of values to a set of perceptions and estimates of the <br>consequences of an action. Sometimes ethical decisions involve choosing, not between good <br>and bad, but between good and better or between bad and worse. A code of conduct for <br>employees sets out the procedures that should be used in specific ethical situations. It also <br>delineates the procedures required to determine whether a violation of the code of conduct <br>has occurred and, if so, what remedies should be imposed.<br>26Activity  7.3:  Ethical dilemma<br>You are selected to be Head Judge in a business competition, where the winner will be <br>awarded a grant of R100 000. You have co-judges, but it has been made clear to you that <br>they will defer to you to guide them on their decision. Your best buddy, Katlego, just <br>happens to be starting an amazing company. It’s a revolutionary idea that could help <br>reduce the environmental damage on 6 out of 7 continents in a rapid timeframe. “I could <br>use the money,” he says. “So, join the contest,” you reply, “but remember, I cannot let <br>our friendship interfere with my final decision.” “I understand. Of course,” he says. “I’m <br>excited to see your presentation,” you say encouragingly.<br>Presentation day comes and it was made clear to the participants that presentations will <br>take place from 10 am–6 pm. Everybody shows up at 9 am to register and claim their <br>time slots. Then they wait till they are called to present. That’s how it’s been done for <br>years. However, Katlego hasn’t shown up and you are worried. At 5 pm, when there was <br>still no sign of him, you surreptitiously call him. You’ve been leaving texts all day, but <br>none of them go through. At 5:55 pm, he shows up. Your co-judges are all still there, but <br>they are packing up. His name isn’t on the list. He looks dejected and tired. You feel the <br>same. You haven’t seen a good presentation all day. None of the young people today had <br>prepared pitches that deserve the amount of money you’re granting. You know Katlego <br>would have killed it and he would have used the money to do something incredible and <br>life-changing, unselfish and humane … But, he didn’t follow the rules. Your co-judges <br>are watching you, wondering what you’re about to say … <br>This is your ethical dilemma … Do you let him present?<br>Go to myUnisa and discuss your thoughts with your fellow students.<br>7. 3 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE<br>76Study the section, “Corporate governance”, in your prescribed textbook and pay attention <br>to the principles that guide governance. Think of how corporate governance can be imple -<br>mented in a small business.<br>7. 4 SUSTAINABILITY<br>77Sustainability is the capacity to endure over the long term through renewal, maintenance <br>and sustenance. From an organisational perspective, sustainability is a criterion used to make <br>decisions about business conduct and to evaluate the outcomes. <br>78Environmental  sustainability involves efforts to protect air, water and land from any harm -<br>ful effects. It also encompasses stewardship for natural resources such as trees and wildlife. <br>Sustainable business practices consider not only the use of resources in production, but also <br>the assurance that those resources can be replenished for future use. Endeavours to reduce <br>greenhouse gasses that are harmful to the atmosphere and to embrace alternative, renewable <br>fuel sources such as wind and energy are examples of business practices that are supportive <br>of environmental sustainability.<br> 27  MNE2601/179The social  dimension of sustainability addresses concerns such as peace and social justice. <br>Efforts to improve education, expand worker rights, minimise the use of child labour and <br>increase the political empowerment of women, especially in developing countries, are ex -<br>amples of social sustainability practices. Reducing poverty by helping people develop the <br>skills to earn their own livelihoods is another example of social sustainability. <br>80Economic  sustainability refers to business practices that do not diminish the prospects of <br>future generations to enjoy levels of consumption, wealth, utility or welfare comparable to <br>those enjoyed in the present. This means companies’ operational practices reduce envi -<br>ronmental damage and resource depletion. Efforts to influence business practices towards <br>economic sustainability include pricing mechanisms such as carbon taxes that pass on the <br>cost of environmental impact to the users of those resources.<br>81Tracking sustainability measures can be performed by disclosing a business’ performance with <br>respect to activities that have a direct impact on the societal, environmental and economic <br>performance of an organisation.<br>Activity  7.4<br>Discuss the relationship between ethics, good governance and sustainability. <br>CONCLUSION<br>82This unit discussed the meaning of ethics and how ethics can be applied in a small business. <br>The differences between law and ethics are also highlighted. It is still widely debated whether <br>corporate governance can be practised in a small business; however, it was discussed here and, <br>as an entrepreneur, you need to apply what works for your particular business. Sustainability <br>and good governance in business are also closely related to ethics and the ways in which a <br>business can seek to become more sustainable is discussed. This is very important for small <br>businesses in emerging economies, as most of them fail within the first few years of operation.<br>Useful terms <br>It is useful for you to know the following important terms and their meaning as they are <br>used in this module.<br> y ethics y corporate governance y sustainability y law y intellectual property<br>13ASSESSMENT <br>After working through this learning unit, you should be able to answer the questions at the end <br>of the chapter in your prescribed textbook. You will find more practice questions on myUnisa.<br>28Learning unit 8<br>Entrepreneurial finance for an emerging economy<br>AIM<br>83The aim of this topic is for you to be aware of the nature of financing and the sources of <br>finance available to an entrepreneur within an emerging market context. After completing <br>this unit, you should be able to:<br> y explain the nature of entrepreneurial finance<br> y discuss the sources of finance available for an entrepreneur <br> y appraise the financial needs of an emerging market entrepreneur<br> y illustrate basic financial entrepreneurial investment valuations<br> y design a financial plan for a small business/entrepreneur <br>INTRODUCTION <br>84This learning unit focuses on an important strategic aspect of the small business, which is <br>finance. We are going to consider the financial needs of an entrepreneur or a small business <br>and the sources of funds that are available for them. Small businesses need this information <br>in order to make use of it when they need to. They also need to know where they can go <br>for financial assistance and which is the best source of finance for their particular situation. <br>Entrepreneurs also need a basic understanding of finance, to be able to make informed <br>investment decisions or draw up a financial plan when necessary.<br>Activity  8.1: Getting started<br>If you are the owner of a small business, discuss with your fellow students your business’ <br>financial journey. If you are an entrepreneur, discuss how you are going to finance your <br>business idea. Share your experiences and thoughts on myUnisa.<br>Study “Challenges of starting a business in an emerging economy” in your pre -<br>scribed textbook.<br>8.1 THE NATURE AND SOURCES OF ENTREPRENEURIAL <br>FINANCE<br>85Access to finance for entrepreneurs and small business owners, especially women, in emerg -<br>ing economies remains a challenge. Small businesses need money in order to finance a host <br>of different requirements, which vary according to the type and stage of development of <br> 29  MNE2601/1the business and the financial circumstances of the entrepreneurs involved (Stokes & Wilson, <br>2017:410). It is therefore important for an entrepreneur or small business owner to match the <br>use of funds with the appropriate funding methods. <br>86An entrepreneur can make use of different sources of finance. You can find more information <br>on this, which you need to study, in your prescribed textbook. <br>Activity  8.2<br>Discuss how commercial banks in South Africa assist small businesses/entrepreneurs <br>financially. Go to myUnisa and discuss this with your fellow students.<br>Small Enterprise Finance Agency (Sefa)<br>Sefa’s core function is to foster the establishment, development and growth of <br>SMMEs and cooperatives, and to contribute towards poverty alleviation, job crea -<br>tion and economic growth.<br>Our task is to provide SMMEs and cooperatives throughout South Africa with simple <br>access to finance, in an efficient and sustainable manner, by:<br>• delivering wholesale and direct lending credit facilities or products<br>• providing credit guarantees to SMMEs and cooperatives<br>• supporting the institutional strengthening of financial intermediaries, so that <br>they can effectively assist small and micro-enterprises and cooperatives<br>• creating strategic partnerships with a range of institutions for sustainable <br>small, micro and cooperative enterprise development and support<br>• monitoring the effectiveness and impact of our financing, credit guarantee and <br>capacity development activities<br>• developing (through partnerships) innovative finance products, tools and <br>channels, to speed up increased market participation in the provision of afford -<br>able finance<br>In South Africa, there are many organisations that support small businesses by lending <br>money to small businesses, Sefa is one such organisation. Visit Sefa’s website, at www.sefa.<br>org.za , and learn more about what they do to assist small businesses through financing. <br>Commercial banks in South Africa have recently developed programmes that assist small <br>businesses by providing finance. Therefore, a small business or entrepreneur has a variety <br>of sources of funds to choose from; however, they need to be aware of these options. <br>8.2 FINANCIAL PLANNING<br>87It is important for a small business or an entrepreneur to have a feasible financial plan, as it will <br>assist in predicting the income and financial needs of the business and how best they can be <br>met. In your prescribed textbook, study the section on, “Determining the financial need of a <br>beginner entrepreneur”, and the subsequent section on the problems that an entrepreneur <br>in an emerging market can come across in planning their finances for the business. <br>308.3 INVESTMENT VALUATION <br>88Equity finance can be provided by banks, venture capital and private individuals acting as <br>“business angels” or, more recently, “crowdfunders”. Venture capital provides risk finance <br>for growing businesses, usually through equity capital (Stokes & Wilson, 2017:417). An entre -<br>preneur therefore needs to understand the value of their investment and the risk involved <br>when using venture capitalists to fund their business. Entrepreneurs/small business owners <br>also need to know how to measure the financial risk of the business so that they are able to <br>factor it in their financial planning. Study how different types of investment can be calculated <br>in your prescribed textbook. <br>8.4 THE COST OF BORROWING<br>89When the entrepreneur decides to make use of sources of finance that include paying back <br>interest, for example long-term debt, they need to also calculate the cost of borrowing. How <br>much will they end up repaying when the loan period is over, and would they be able afford <br>it? That is why it is also important to employ capital budgeting techniques. Every investment <br>includes cash outflows and cash inflows. There is the cash that is required to make the invest -<br>ment and (hopefully) the return.<br>90In order to see whether the cash outflows are less than the cash inflows (i.e., the investment <br>earns a positive return), the investor aggregates the cash flows. Since cash flows occur over a <br>period of time, the investor knows that, due to the time value of money, each cash flow has a <br>certain value today. Thus, in order to calculate the cash inflows and outflows, each cash flow <br>must be discounted to a common point in time. You will find examples of capital budgeting <br>techniques in your prescribed textbook.<br>Study the break-even analysis in your prescribed textbook. As an entrepreneur or <br>small business owner, you need to know how to calculate the break-even point <br>of your business.<br>Activity  8.3<br>What other sources of finance are available for the small business owner/entrepreneur? <br>Share your findings with your fellow students on myUnisa.<br>CONCLUSION<br>91This learning unit focused on the uses and sources of finance that are available to the entre -<br>preneur or small business owner. It is important to choose the appropriate source of finance <br>that best suits the needs of your business at a given time. Financial and investment planning <br>is also important for the entrepreneur to determine future cash inflows and outflows of the <br>business.<br> 31  MNE2601/1Useful terms <br>It is useful for you to know the following important terms and their meanings as they <br>are used in this modue.<br> y internal/external finance y venture capital y sources of finance y financial planning y investment<br>14ASSESSMENT<br>After working through this learning unit, you should be able to answer the questions at the end <br>of the chapter in your prescribed textbook. You will find more practice questions on myUnisa.<br>32Learning unit 9<br>Enterprise development<br>AIM<br>92The aim of this topic is for you to be able to overcome obstacles in small business manage -<br>ment and to grow a small business in an emerging economy. After completing this unit, you <br>should be able to<br> y explain the concept of enterprise development<br> y demonstrate knowledge of the SMME environment in emerging economies<br> y discuss the business life cycle in an entrepreneurial environment<br> y describe the process of business incubation<br> y apply growth strategies to different stages of the lifecycle of the business<br>INTRODUCTION <br>93Enterprise development is a vehicle that can be adopted in emerging economies to foster <br>economic growth. Growth takes the form of a life cycle and it is not usually sudden. Entre -<br>preneurs and small business owners need to understand the concept of growth and the <br>different stages in which they may find their business and be able to apply the appropriate <br>growth strategies. The entrepreneur or small business owner also needs to understand his/<br>her environment and apply appropriate growth strategies that suit the environment. Another <br>form of enterprise development comes in the form of incubation, which is becoming popular <br>in emerging economies.<br>Activity  9.1: Getting started<br>Read the case study, “Chesa Nyama”, in your prescribed textbook and discuss the implica -<br>tions of listing your business on the stock exchange. You can read more on listing at the <br>end of the chapter, in your prescribed textbook, BUT you will not be examined on this.<br>Study “The life cycle of an enterprise” in your prescribed textbook.<br>9.1 LIFE CYCLE OF A BUSINESS<br>94An enterprise moves through different stages of growth; however, most small businesses <br>do not actually go through these stages, as they fail within a short time of becoming opera -<br>tional, especially in emerging economies. The important factor in the lifecycle of a business <br>is for the small business owner to be aware that different strategies and skills are required at <br> 33  MNE2601/1different stages of a business’ life (Stokes & Wilson, 2017:233). Setting up a new business will <br>not require the same managerial tasks as running an existing, fast growing one. A small busi -<br>ness owner has to redefine their role and be flexible as the business circumstances change.<br>15Read the section, “Growing an entrepreneurial venture”, in your prescribed text -<br>book, and learn about the characteristics of a growing firm and the different growth <br>strategies that is available to an entrepreneur.<br>Activity  9.2<br>Is success equal to growth? Does every small business have to grow into a larger enter -<br>prise? What about small businesses that have survived for more than 20 years, but still <br>remain small, are they successful? Go to myUnisa to discuss this with your fellow students.<br>.<br>9.2 SMALL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN EMERGING <br>ECONOMIES<br>95Small businesses in emerging economies often find themselves in difficult circumstances <br>with little or no support and this may lead to closure or, in some instances, a failure to grow. <br>Governments have tried to create enabling environments for small business growth in emerg -<br>ing economies and it is up to small business owners to utilise the support that is best suited <br>for their business circumstances. <br>96In your prescribed textbook, study “The SMME environment in emerging economies” AND <br>“Small business policies in South Africa, India and Brazil” AND “Small business support”. <br>Compare how the different governments offer support to small businesses and how they <br>create an enabling environment for small businesses. <br>Activity  9.3<br>Discuss the funding agencies that are available to small businesses in South Africa. If you <br>have used any if these agencies, please share your experience. Go to myUnisa and discuss <br>this with your fellow students.<br>9.3 INCUBATION<br>97Incubation is one form of business development that assist in the development of starting or <br>operating micro and small enterprises to transform ideas into products, processes and ser -<br>vices. They offer technical, management and additional training support to the entrepreneur <br>and also technical support for the development of their product. As such, the venture can <br>be accompanied with expert advice, starting at the planning phase until the consolidation <br>of its activities (Rizzi, Wescinski, Poli & Jacoski, 2017).<br>3498In Brazil, the business incubation process is divided into the following categories: (1) technol -<br>ogy-based incubators; (2) traditional incubators; (3) mixed incubators; (4) social incubators; <br>and (5) incubators of cooperatives. The technology-based incubators deal with companies <br>in which technology represents a significant portion of the value added to the products, <br>processes or services. The traditional incubators, in turn, cover companies in different sec -<br>tors of the economy that want to add value to their products, processes or services, but <br>which use widely-diffused technologies. The mixed incubators are those containing both <br>technology-based ventures and traditional sectors of the economy. Finally, the social and <br>cooperative incubators bring together ventures from social projects and associations (Rizzi, <br>Wescinski, Poli & Jacoski, 2017).<br>99Are you aware of the business incubation environment in South Africa or other emerging <br>economies? <br>Activity  9.4<br>Read the following article and discuss the contents with fellow students on myUnisa: <br>Lose, T, Nxopo, Z, Maziriri, E & Madinga, W. 2016.

Œconomica  12(5).<br>9.4 CONCLUSION<br>100In this learning unit, you have learned about business growth and what it means to a small <br>business owner in an emerging economy. The lifecycle of the business is an important factor <br>when planning for growth and the small business owner must know the different growth <br>strategies that are applicable during the different lifecycle stages or circumstances of a busi -<br>ness. It is also important to note the types of support that are available for small businesses in <br>emerging economies that would help them to grow or, at the very least, survive and continue <br>contributing to the economy. Incubation is recognised in emerging economies as a support <br>tool for new small businesses, which can help them to develop and grow. <br>Useful terms <br>It is useful for you to know the following important terms and their meanings as they <br>are used in this module.<br> y enterprise development y incubation y lifecycle y growth<br>16ASSESSMENT<br>After working through this learning unit, you should be able to answer the questions at the end <br>of the chapter, in your prescribed textbook. You will find more practice questions on myUnisa.<br> 35  MNE2601/1Learning unit 10<br>Alternative paths to entrepreneurship<br>AIM<br>101The aim of this topic is for you to be aware of other ways to start a business, namely fran -<br>chising and buying an existing business. After completing this unit, you should be able to:<br> y identify the different concepts in franchising<br> y discuss the considerations for purchasing an existing small business<br> y evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of buying an existing business, as op -<br>posed to starting a new venture<br> y apply the different methods of valuation of an existing business<br> y explain the different types and forms of franchising<br> y discuss the requirements of establishing a franchise business<br> y discuss the advantages and disadvantages of franchising<br>INTRODUCTION <br>102Buying an existing business can be more beneficial than starting from scratch, but also car -<br>ries a significant amount of potential problems. Entrepreneurs can choose to buy an existing <br>business as a means of market entry, especially where the barriers to entry for a new start-up <br>are sufficiently high. An entrepreneur needs to be aware of all the factors surrounding the <br>business they wish to purchase, so that they can make an informed decision. Franchising is <br>a method for starting a new business within the framework of an existing, larger business <br>entity. The entrepreneur should be aware of the different forms and types of franchising and <br>how to establish a franchise business.<br>Activity  10.1:  Getting started<br>In your opinion, what motivates entrepreneurs to opt for an existing business rather than <br>starting one from scratch? <br>10.1  BUYING AN EXISTING BUSINESS<br>103In buying an existing business, it is important to recognise what exactly is for sale. This will <br>depend on the legal status of the business and whether it will be sold with its assets or not. <br>The entrepreneur needs to be aware of the tangible assets of the business such as stock, <br>machinery, furniture and the intangible assets such as goodwill, image, employees and cus -<br>tomers. The entrepreneur or small business owner needs to take all assets into consideration <br>that are being sold as part of the valuation of the business.<br>36104There are two basic ways of valuing an existing business, namely:<br>1. The market or other valuation of the assets to be acquired – the tangible assets are <br>usually valued in this way, in other words, the property, fixtures and fittings, equipment, <br>stock and debtors can all be physically and separately identified and valued.<br>2. Multiple of the annual profits  – in this case, a buyer can consider the earning power <br>of the business now and in the future as a basis for valuation. This brings into play the <br>valuation of the intangible assets, which are usually measured through profit.<br>105Some businesses are asset rich and therefore profitability becomes of secondary importance <br>in the valuation. In this case, businesses would be priced according to the market value of <br>other similar businesses in the area. Businesses with no real tangible assets such as service <br>industries can only be measured by profitability, because their assets are overwhelmingly <br>intangible. Practically, businesses are usually valued on a mix of both tangible and intangible <br>assets (Stokes & Wilson, 2017:292). <br>106If intangible assets are to be judged by profitability, how much profit should be taken into <br>account? This is normally expressed as a multiple of annual profits, taking the following fac -<br>tors into consideration:<br> y Quality of earnings  – which is measured by a history of several profitable years <br>in business. If a business can demonstrate that it has a sound, continuing level of <br>profitability and has a well-established customer base, then it is said to have good <br>quality earnings.<br> y The interest rates  need to be taken into consideration, because, when the interest <br>on a loan to buy a business exceeds the profits of that business, then it will not be <br>a viable option. The same can be said for the rate of inflation, where the return or <br>profits of an investment have to keep pace with inflation just to maintain its value.<br> y Non-quantitative factors in valuing a business  – when buying an existing business, <br>there are other factors, which are not monetary, that an entrepreneur should consider, <br>study these in your prescribed textbook. These factors also apply when considering <br>franchising as a way to get into business. <br>Activity  10.2<br>In addition to the above, what other factors might be important when valuing a business? <br>Go to myUnisa to discuss this with your fellow students.<br>10.2  ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BUYING AN  <br>EXISTING BUSINESS<br>107Stokes and Wilson (2017:295) suggest the following advantages and disadvantages of buying <br>an existing business:<br>108<br> 37  MNE2601/1109Advantages<br> y Overcomes barriers to market entry  – where barriers exist, buying an existing <br>business may be the most realistic alternative, for instance, the entrepreneur does <br>not have to go through the process of obtaining legal permits.<br> y Buying immediate turnover and income  – this is important, especially when the <br>buyer has no other sources of income.<br> y Buying market share  in a specific market, which is one of the key ingredients for <br>a successful small business. If existing businesses control a significant percentage <br>of the market, then it might be advantageous to buy into that market, rather than <br>to compete with them.<br> y The cost and time required to put in place existing assets of property, equip -<br>ment and staff  can be considerable, it may therefore be more appropriate to focus <br>resources and energy on the marketplace through an existing business. <br> y Goodwill with existing customers  is evidence of the viability of a business concept <br>and therefore takes some of the risk out of small business ownership.<br> y An existing track record  brings the ability to look over the past performance of a <br>business and provides comfort, not only to the potential buyer, but to financial in -<br>stitutions such as banks. It is easier to fund a business with evidence of a good track <br>record, over a number of years, than one with no history at all.<br>110Disadvantages<br> y Buying possible liabilities with assets can form part of the risk when they are <br>known; however, the greatest problem is the possibility of liabilities that are not <br>recognised at the time of purchase emerging at a later date.<br> y Uncertainty over records  – sole traders and partnerships are not required to have their <br>accounts audited, so some information may be withheld. The onus here is therefore <br>on the buyer to ask the right questions, not on the seller to provide all the information.<br> y Risk in regard to intangible assets  – for instance, the goodwill inherent in an exist -<br>ing business, which can disappear very rapidly if a new owner makes inappropriate <br>changes. A previous owner may represent a substantial part of the goodwill, which <br>goes with them when they leave.<br> y Historical problems in the business , which can be negative goodwill that is not <br>immediately apparent in the form of poor relationships with suppliers or staff.<br> y Not all my own work – some of the satisfaction an entrepreneur gains from starting <br>a new business, including taking a business idea from its conception to successful <br>implementation, can be diminished by buying an existing business. There is no sense <br>of achievement and, often times, no motivation to make it succeed.<br>Activity  10.3 <br>In your prescribed textbook, read about the franchising opportunities in South Africa <br>and the franchising environment in emerging economies in Africa. Go to myUnisa and <br>discuss this with your fellow students.<br>3810.3  FRANCHISING<br>111Franchising is a business arrangement in which one party (the franchisor) allows others (the <br>franchisees) to use a business name or sell products in such a way that the franchisee op -<br>erates their own legally separate business (Stokes & Wilson, 2017:257). This means that the <br>franchisee pays for the right to use the franchisor’s trade name/trademark, business know <br>how, methods, systems and other intellectual property rights. The parties have to sign a <br>franchise agreement. Franchising comes mainly in the form of business format, product or <br>distribution and manufacturing, production or process franchising, which are discussed in <br>your prescribed textbook. There are also different types of franchisees, depending on the <br>business or industry in which they are found. <br>Study the section on the different types of franchising in your prescribed textbook. <br>Activity  10.4<br>Is a franchise a small business or a managed branch of a larger organisation? Go to myUnisa <br>and discuss this with your fellow students.<br>10.4  DISADVANTAGES AND ADVANTAGES OF FRANCHISING<br>112Franchising can be beneficial to both the franchisor and the franchisee. The advantages and <br>disadvantages from both perspectives are discussed in your prescribed textbook. To make an <br>informed decision, the entrepreneur needs to be aware of the advantages and disadvantages <br>associated with franchising before making the decision to buy. <br>10.5  ESTABLISHING A FRANCHISE BUSINESS<br>113Both the franchisee and the franchisor need to be aware of the financial aspects when enter -<br>ing the franchise agreement, for example, the upfront fee and ongoing monthly fees that <br>the franchisee needs to pay. In establishing a franchise, the franchisor should make available <br>all the business procedures and operations so that it is clear to the franchisee what they are <br>buying. There are factors that the franchisor should take into consideration to be able to <br>franchise the business, which are discussed in your prescribed textbook.<br>Study the sections, “How to establish a franchise business operation” AND  “De -<br>veloping the franchise package” in your prescribed textbook. <br> 39  MNE2601/1CONCLUSION<br>114In this learning unit, you have learned about two alternative routes to entrepreneurship. <br>Buying an existing business and franchising were discussed as alternatives available to the <br>entrepreneur, who wants to hit the ground running in business. Not having the stress of set -<br>ting up a business is one of the advantages of buying an already existing business. However, <br>there are also disadvantages related to buying an existing business, which an entrepreneur <br>has to take into account. Therefore, the entrepreneur should be able to weigh the benefits as <br>well as the drawbacks of buying an existing business to make an informed and, potentially, <br>a profitable decision. <br>Useful terms <br>It is useful for you to know the following important terms and their meanings, as they <br>are used in this module:<br> y franchising y franchisor/franchisee y business valuation y business-format franchising<br>17ASSESSMENT <br>After working through this learning unit, you should be able to answer the questions at the end <br>of the chapter in your prescribed textbook. You will find more practice questions on myUnisa.<br>40Learning unit 11<br>The family business<br>AIM<br>115The aim of this topic is to understand the structure of the family business and be able to identify <br>elements that are unique to emerging economies. After completing this unit, you should be able to:<br> y define a family business<br> y explain the dynamics of a family business in emerging economies<br> y distinguish between a family business in a developed and in an emerging economy<br> y discuss the challenges faced by family businesses in emerging economies<br> y identify family business systems/models<br>INTRODUCTION <br>116An entrepreneur can choose to go into business with family members and, if the prospects <br>are to hand the business over to another generation in the family, then the business can be <br>seen as a family business. This learning unit will focus on the structure of the family busi -<br>ness, determine if there are any differences in family businesses in developed and emerging <br>economies and on the challenges that are unique to the family business. This will enable <br>the entrepreneur or small business owner to make an informed decision as to whether they <br>want to go into business with family members or not.<br>Activity  11.1  <br>What are the advantages and disadvantages of having a business run by members of <br>the same family? <br>11.1  DEFINING THE FAMILY BUSINESS<br>117Definitions of a family business vary, however, the most accepted definitions suggest that <br>a family business employs more than one family member, which is common in family busi -<br>nesses, and is passed on to a second generation, which happens less frequently (Stokes & <br>Wilson, 2017:469). <br>Study the definition of a family business in your prescribed textbook.<br> 41  MNE2601/1Activity  11. 2<br>Study the section, “Family business theories/models”, in your textbook, and discuss any <br>conflict that may occur in the two broad systems of the family business. Go to myUnisa <br>and discuss this with your fellow students.<br>11. 2  FAMILY BUSINESS DYNAMICS IN EMERGING MARKETS<br>118Work through this section in your prescribed textbook to get a sense of what differentiates <br>a family business in an emerging economy from such a business in a more developed one. <br>A family business has to navigate through certain aspects that are not found in a non-family <br>business, such as succession. <br>119After studying this section, you should be able to identify the challenges that a family business is <br>faced with, the competitive advantage it has and how a family business can manage succession.<br>Activity  11. 3<br>Read, “Family business in the African context”, in your prescribed textbook and share your <br>thoughts on whether there is a uniqueness to family businesses in the African context. <br>Go to myUnisa and discuss it with your fellow students.<br>11. 3  FAMILY BUSINESSES IN SOUTH AFRICA<br>120This learning unit concludes in your prescribed textbook by looking at family businesses in South <br>Africa. You need to identify the challenges faced by family businesses specifically in South Africa.<br>Activity 11.4<br>What are the characteristics of a family business that differentiates it from a non-family <br>business? Discuss as many characteristics that you can think of.<br>11. 4  CHARACTERISTICS OF A FAMILY BUSINESS<br>121Motivations of running a family business may differ from that of a non-family business some <br>of which are discussed below:<br> y The priority of a family business may be to provide employment and income for <br>family members, with less emphasis on commercial goals such as profit generation <br>and business growth.<br> y The family hierarchy is an added complication to the normal issues of managing <br>people. This may act as a constraint, which sometimes contradicts business ra -<br>42tionality when preference is given to family members in recruitment, training and <br>remuneration.<br> y Issues relating to the ownership of the business and responsibilities in running the <br>business are often less clear in a family business, but can be an advantage in terms <br>of speedy decision making due to short lines of communication.<br> y It can be argued that succession issues are the most important defining feature of a <br>family business. The impending departure or retirement of the founder or leader of <br>the business can be destabilising. Conflict may easily arise when there is no natural <br>successor (Stokes & Wilson, 2017:469).<br>CONCLUSION<br>122In this learning unit, you were introduced to the family business, its structure and character -<br>istics and how it differs from a non-family business. A family business needs to navigate the <br>business environment with added challenges such as succession planning and other issues, <br>which are unique to the family business. For a family business to survive, it needs to come <br>up with strategies to deal with these unique issues. From an emerging market perspective, <br>these challenges become contextualised and they have to be taken as such. As a small <br>business owner and entrepreneur, we hope to have given you enough information in this <br>introduction to family businesses for you to decide whether to go into business with family <br>members or not.<br>Useful terms <br>It is useful for you to know the following important terms and their meanings, as they <br>are used in this module.<br> y Family business y Family system y Succession y Advisory board<br>18ASSESSMENT <br>After working through this learning unit, you should be able to answer the questions at the end <br>of the chapter, in your prescribed textbook.

After completing this <br>unit, you should be able to:<br> y define social entrepreneurship <br> y differentiate between social and commercial entrepreneurship<br> y explain the benefits and importance of social entrepreneurship<br> y discuss the driving forces of social entrepreneurship that are relevant to South Africa<br>INTRODUCTION<br>124Some entrepreneurs are not solely driven by profit, they also motivated to resolve some or <br>other social problem. Social entrepreneurship has the primary objective of adding value to <br>the society rather than to the individual behind the entrepreneurial venture. In this learning <br>unit, you will learn about the social entrepreneur, the importance of social entrepreneurship <br>and what drives social entrepreneurship in South Africa. <br>Activity  12.1 <br>What do you understand by the term “social entrepreneurship”? Go to myUnisa and <br>discuss this with your fellow students.<br>12.1  DEFINING SOCIAL AND COMMERCIAL <br>ENTREPRENEURSHIP<br>125Social entrepreneurs do not have profit or other personal needs as their primary aim, but <br>they use entrepreneurial processes to fulfil the social or economic needs of others. Social <br>entrepreneurs make a positive difference in the lives of others by emphasising the social <br>responsibility of their ventures, before the need to maximise profits. <br>19Read the section, “Defining social entrepreneurship and commercial entrepre -<br>neurship” in your prescribed textbook. <br>126Take note of the benefits of social entrepreneurship to both the entrepreneur and society. <br>Also, distinguish between social and traditional entrepreneurs AND the importance of social <br>entrepreneurship. From the definition of social entrepreneurship, it is clear that entrepreneurs <br>put the needs of society before themselves, thereby achieving a societal advantage.<br>44Activity  12.2<br>Give examples of social entrepreneurs whom you know and briefly discuss their business <br>focus? Go to myUnisa and discuss this with your fellow students.<br>12.2  SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN SOUTH AFRICA<br>127Social entrepreneurship tends to produce greater value in emerging economies, as these <br>economies have limited resources. Therefore, social value and sustainability become impor -<br>tant in an emerging economy. <br>128Work through the section on social entrepreneurship in the South African context and take note <br>of the driving forces of social entrepreneurship in an emerging economy such as South Africa. <br>Activity  12.3 <br>Read the case study, “Case study on ambition: Muhammad Yunus”, and answer the ques -<br>tions that follow. Go to myUnisa and discuss it with your fellow students.<br>CONCLUSION<br>129In this learning unit, you were introduced to the concept of social entrepreneurship. Social <br>entrepreneurs’ main objective is to contribute to the lives of others in a positive way and <br>maximising profit is not their primary objective. The importance and benefits of social entre -<br>preneurs were discussed and how these enterprises differ from traditional entrepreneurial <br>ventures. The prospective social entrepreneur also has to be aware of the environment in <br>which they operate in order to know which social problems exist in that specific environment.<br>Useful terms <br>It is useful for you to know the following important terms and their meaning, as they are <br>used in this module.<br> y social entrepreneurship y social value y sustainability<br>20ASSESSMENT<br>After working through this learning unit, you should be able to answer the questions at the end <br>of the chapter, in your prescribed textbook.
