(iii) MNG3702/1 /2020 -2022  (iv) OVERVIEW  
Dear Student  
Welcome to module MNG3702 entitled Strategy Implementation and Control.  In this module, we explore 
the implementation and control of strategy as part of the strategic management process. We will provide 
you with detailed theory and applications of the theory pertaining to strategy implementation and 
control. We will also prov ide you with additional opportunities to evaluate decisions and choices with 
regard to strategy implementation and control in practical business situations - which is a requirement to 
pass this module.  
1 PURPOSE OF THE MODULE  
Students who complete this modul e can identify, analyse, interpret and critically evaluate  
the choices made in implementing and controlling business -level strategy, and think  
strategically when making recommendations on strategy implementation and strategic  
control measures in practical situations. The module has seven specific learning outcomes:  
Specific outcome 1: Conceptualise the fit of strategy implementation and control within  
the broader strategic management process.  
Specific outcome 2: Develop a plan for strategic change in an organisation.  
Specific outcome 3: Develop a framework for resource allocation for successful strategy  
implementation in an organisation.  
Specific outcome 4: Develop a plan for an organisation to become a learning organisation.  
Specific outcome 5: Construct  an organisational architecture for successful strategy  
implementation.  
Specific outcome 6: Develop a plan and tools for strategic control in an organisation.  
Specific outcome 7: Develop a risk management framework for successful strategy  
implementation an d control in an organisation.

(ix) (x) Lesson 1  
INTRODUCTION TO STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION  
AND CONTROL  
Lesson 1 is based on chapters 1 to 7 in the prescribed book. You should read  
these chapters before you commence your study of Strategy Implementation  
and Control.  
Before we commence our study of Strategy Implementation and Control,  it is important to  
refresh our memory and understanding of the concept strategic management.  Although  
module MNG3701 entitled Strategic Planning  is a prerequisite for module MNG3702  
(Strategy Implementation and Control),  for some qualifications students are permitted to  
register for both modules simultaneously. For this reason, we will commence this module  
with an overview of Strategic Management by first discussing the traditional approach  
and then the contemporary framework thereof.  
Learning Outcomes  
After you have completed the  lesson, you should be able to  
• define the term strategic management  
•  explain the contemporary strategic management framework  
• demonstrate an understanding of where strategy implementation and control fits into 
the strategic management process  
• identify the components of organisational architecture  
• demonstrate a basic understanding of organisational architecture and its role in strategy 
implementation  
1.1 STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
Take a moment and formulate a definition of the term strategic management.  When you Google the term 
you will literally find hundreds of different explanations of the term. A closer look at all these definitions 
will reveal certain common elements. Firstly, strategic management is about setting direction for an 
organisation as a whole, setting goals and crafting a strategy. Secondly, strategic management is about 
implementing and executing strategy, and then over time and through a controlling process, initiating 
whatever corrective adjustments and corrections are deemed appropria te. This view is considered a more 
traditional view of strategic management and it provides us with a good starting point to understand 
strategic management. The traditional view of strategic management boils down to three distinct phases, 
namely strategic  planning, implementation and control. This is also referred to as the process perspective 
of strategic management.  
 
1  
Key Concepts  
Strategic management is the process for planning, implementing and controlling strategy  
for the organisation.  
More recent views of the strategic management concept suggest that strategy is not this  
sequential and discrete,  in other words, following a neat process of planning, implementing  
and controlling strategy. Instead, it is a rather messy, overlapping and iterative process.  
Independent of the approach followed (the traditional view or the more contemporary  
view) to dev elop and manage strategy in an organisation, the purpose of strategic  
management is to ensure that the organisation applies four key elements, namely:  
1 a clear and consistent long -term strategic direction in terms of what the organisation  
wants to achieve i n future  
2 a profound understanding of the external environment to ensure that the  
organisation is able to align itself with opportunities and to deal with threats as  
effectively as possible  
3 an objective knowledge of the key resources, capabilities and weakn esses that the  
organisation possesses as well as their value to allow the organisation to build on  
these and develop a distinct competitive advantage  
4 a proper alignment of organisational strategies, structure, systems, culture, and  
functional and operation al management (collectively referred to as organisational  
architecture) to ensure the effective implementation of strategic plans, portfolios,  
programmes, projects and initiatives  
Although we acknowledge the contribution of traditional strategic management  
perspectives to our understanding of this important field, we also need to acknowledge  
and incorporate newer thinking in our perspective of strategic management. To this end,  
we have devised a contemporary framework of strategic management. Before we take  
a closer look at the contemporary strategic management framework, let us try to apply  
each of these key elements of strategic management to a South African company, Edcon,  
to enhance your understanding thereof. The first activity below, focuses on element  1, 
namely the determination of a clear and consistent long -term strategic direction in terms  
of what the company wants to achieve in future.  
Activity  
Since its founding in 1929, Edgars Consolidated Stores Ltd (Edcon) has established itself  
as one of the l eaders in South Africa's clothing, footwear and textile retail arena. Visit the  
Edcon website (http://www.edcon.co.za/about -strategy.php ) and identify statements of  
the long -term strategic direction of the company.  
 
 
2 MNG3702/1  
Edcon's vision is to ensure that the company remains "The Places to Go" in its chosen 
markets and to entrench its position as southern Africa's largest non -food retailer. The com -
pany focuses on distinctive retail formats, exceptional value proposition and choice of 
product, focused customer groupings and creating unique experiences for its customers.  
The following activity focuses on element 2 of the strategic management process, namely  
a profound understanding of the external environment to ensure that the organisation is  
able to align itself with opportunities and to deal with threats as effectively as possible.  
Activity  
Access the Edcon Acquisition Proprietary Limited Unaudited Trading update for the  
13 weeks end ed 23 December 2017 that is available online:  https://www.edcon.co.za/  
pdf/announcements/2018/edcon -acquisition -proprietary -limited -trading -update -q3-2018.  
pdf. Critically evaluate the external environment of Edcon to identify the opportunities  
and threats that the company faced during the fourth quarter of 2017.  
 
Feedback  
During the fourth quarter of 2017, Edcon faced a number of threats, such as the following:  
• low consumer confidence  
• increased competition for the Edcon Group from established market participants as well as 
new market entrants  
• weaker consumer demand  
• tight credit conditions  
• low growth in consumer disposable income  
• high unemployment rates and high fuel prices  
• fierce price competition through ongoing promotions and clearance activity by competitors  
Apart  from the threats, Edcon also faced a number of opportunities, for example:  
• Edcon found a buyer for its Legit business  
• information technology  
The next activity deals with the third element of strategic management, namely an objective knowledge 
of the key r esources, capabilities and the weaknesses that the organisation possesses as well as their 
value to allow the organisation to build on these and to develop a distinct competitive advantage.  
3 Activity  
Access the  Edcon Acquisition Proprietary Limited Unaudited Trading update for the  
13 weeks ended 23 December 2017 that is available online:  https://www.edcon.co.za/  
pdf/announcements/2018/edcon -acquisition -proprietary -limited -trading -update -q3-2018.  
pdf. Critically evaluate the internal environment of Edcon to identify the most important  
resources that the company has access to and its most import ant capabilities. Also, identify  
the weaknesses in the company's internal environment that are evident in this report.  
Feedback  
The most important resources and capabilities of the company during the third quarter of 2017, 
were the following:  
• well-managed input costs  
• negotiation skills with suppliers in terms of rebates and discounts  
• foreign exchange management - Edcon applies a strategy of hedging committed foreign 
denominated orders  
Apart from the resources and capabilities, the report also highlights certain weaknesses of Edcon, 
for example:  
• the company had to sell its Legit business and exit non -profitable international brands  
• Edcon had to close unprofitable stores  
• weak financial performance (the company had to be taken over by banks and bondholders 
in 2016 to avoid collapse)  
The last activity focuses on element four of strategic management. This element entails a proper 
alignment of organisational strategies, structure, systems, culture, and functional and operational 
management (collectively referre d to as organisational architecture) to ensure the effective 
implementation of strategic plans, portfolios, programmes, projects and initiatives.  
Activity  
Read the feedback in terms of the previous three activities provided. Then, read the  
following articl e: Edcon of South Africa plans to Close Chains in Recovery Plan, which  
is available online  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/article s/2018 -07-04/edcon -of-south - 
africa -plans -to-shut-down -chains -in-recovery -plan. Do you agree with Edcon's decision  
to close  its chain stores Red Square and Boardmans in an attempt to lure customers to  
its flagship Edgars clothing stores. Substantiate your answer.

MNG3702/1  
Feedback  
Edcon struggled for many years to perform better financially. An analysis of the company's 
external environment indicates weak consumer spending and weak economic growth leading to 
weak sales and profits. The current  poor economic situation in the country (and even worldwide) 
has a direct influence on the company, which will not change or improve dramatically in the 
near future. There are few opportunities that the company can explore to improve its poor 
financial sit uation. An analysis of its internal resources and capabilities, reveals very poor 
financial performance over a number of years (you may have a look at the annual reports of the 
company for the past five years that are available online). The company had to be taken over by 
banks and bondholders to avoid its collapse. The recovery strategy will cut floor space by 17% 
over five years to boost profitability, so that Edcon can focus primarily on Edgars. Edcon will 
retain its CNA and Jet divisions. Its recovery s trategy is probably the only possible strategy that 
will save the company from liquidation.

1.2 A CONTEMPORARY STRATEGIC M ANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  
In this module, we adopt the contemporary strategic management framework, which is also the 
framework used in the prescribed book. This framework is depicted in the figure below and gives us a 
clear indication of where strategy implementation and control fits into the strategic management 
process:

Figure 1.1: A contemporary strategic management framework  
Source: Venter (2019:12)  
Strategy formation  
As indicated in figure 1.1, strategy formation consists of three components: process, context and content.  
Process. In the first place, there are certain general processes, which can be both formal and informal, to 
develop strategy. This addresses the question "how" strategy develops in the organisation. The process 
(or traditional) perspective of strategic man agement is addressed in chapter 3 of the prescribed book and 
was also covered in module MNG3701 entitled Strategic Planning.  According to this perspective, strategic 
management consists of three stages. The first stage is strategic planning, which is a con ceptual process 
that consists of an environmental analysis and the development of strategies. The second stage is called 
strategy implementation, which is also referred to as the action phase. During this phase, all staff in the 
organisation are tasked wit h implementing the strategies. The third and last stage is strategic control, 
which is also referred to as the review or monitoring phase. The strategy review phase is aimed at 
monitoring progress and providing feedback. The process  part of strategy format ion also relates to 
strategists and strategising, which are explained in chapter 4 of the prescribed book and covered in 
module MNG3701.  
Context. Strategy is always context bound. In other words, it takes place in a certain external and internal 
context, and this provides us the "why" of strategy. Organisations function in a globalised economy and 
therefore need to explore its global, continental, regional, country, industry, and internal issues and forces. 
The external context and the risks it presents is  explored in chapter 5 of the prescribed book, while the 
internal context and the strategic resources and capabilities of the organisation in covered in chapter 6 as 
well as in the MNG3701 module.  
6 MNG3702/1  
Content. The content of str ategy refers to the actual development of strategies (i.e. the "what") to 
compete in industries and to create shareholder value, and is examined in chapter 7 of the prescribed 
book as well as in the MNG3701 module.  
In figure 1.1, the lines between the abov e three components (process, content and context) indicate that 
the components are interrelated. Strategy is a process, which takes place in a certain context, with the aim 
to develop actual strategies to compete in industries and to create value. Next, we  look at strategy 
implementation.  
Strategy implementation  
The actual strategies developed during strategy formation, should be implemented and controlled. 
Therefore, figure 1.1 indicates arrows between strategy formation, implementation and control. Strategies 
are implemented through various elements, indicted in the organisational architecture block of figure 1.1, 
namely leadership and governance, capabilities, structure, technology and culture. Organisational 
architecture also influences the future strategic direction, therefore an arrow leads from the organisational 
architecture block to the strategy formation block. Strategy implementation consist of three important 
elements, namely change management, organisational learning and resource allocation . 
Change management. The alignment of organisational architecture with strategy formation does not 
happen naturally, and the organisation has to put in place formal processes to manage the large -scale 
change associated with strategy. This aspect is explore d in lesson 2 (chapter 8 of the prescribed book). 
You will notice the one -way arrow between strategy formation and organisational architecture in terms of 
change management. The reason is that various management processes are specifically aimed at aligning  
architecture with strategy, thus following a top -down approach.  
The learning organisation. The less formal processes of organisational learning to recognise and respond 
to the need for change is discussed in lesson 3 (chapter 9 of the prescribed book). Yo u will notice the 
two-way arrow between strategy formation and organisational architecture in terms of organisational 
learning. The reason for this is that organisational learning is iterative. Organisational architecture also 
influences learning, which ca n then have a bottom -up effect on strategy formation.  
Resource allocation. The allocation of resources to portfolios, programmes, projects and organisational 
structures responsible for giving effect to strategy is the topic of lesson 4 (chapter 10 of the p rescribed 
book). You will notice the one -way arrow between strategy formation and organisational architecture in 
terms of resource allocation. The reason is that various management processes are specifically aimed at 
aligning architecture with strategy, th us following a top -down approach.  
Next, we look at the last part of strategic management, namely strategic control.  
7 Strategic control  
Continuous environmental scanning (both formal and informal) helps to ensure monitoring and control 
processes. On the one hand, environmental scanning and control need to ensure that the strategy as 
planned is on track and to alert key decision makers if interventions are required. This is represented by 
the arrow from left to right. On the other hand, l eaders, strategists and other role players in the 
organisation (e.g. market intelligence experts) may pick up signals from the environment that could affect 
the strategy formation process. This is represented by the arrow from right to left. This aspect is  examined 
in more depth in chapter 14.  
Organisational architecture  
Organisational architecture is a management tool that is used to describe the workings of an 
organisation, especially with regard to the alignment of strategy and the organisation. It is a model of the 
organisation that can be shared by everyone involved in managing change and aligning strategy with 
structure. There are many different perspectives on organisational architecture and what it comprises of, 
but for purposes of this module we hav e focused on the three main elements, namely culture, leadership 
and governance, and structure.  
Culture. Organisational culture is so powerful that no plan will work if it is counter to the culture of the 
organisation. In lesson 5 (chapter 11 in the prescr ibed book) we focus on organisational culture and its 
vital role in aligning strategy and organisational architecture.  
Responsible leadership. Lesson 6 (chapter 12 in the prescribed book) deals with the closely related issue 
of leadership and its role in s trategy implementation and governance.  
Structure. The structure of the organisation refers to the physical manifestation of the organisation in 
terms of geographical distribution, positions, reporting and communication lines and so on. The role of 
structur e in the alignment of structure and strategy is the topic of lesson 7 (chapter 13 in the prescribed 
book).  
Resources and capabilities  
The success of organisations is very dependent on their possession of unique strategic resources and 
valuable capabilities  that form the foundation upon which the organisation is built and can grow. The role 
of resources and capabilities in the alignment of structure and strategy is the topic of chapter 5 in the 
prescribed book, which you have already covered in your studies for the module MNG3701.  
You will notice that the elements of organisational architecture in figure 1.1 are linked. This indicates that 
these elements are interrelated. Together, these elements also provide inputs to the future strategic 
direction and strategy formation, therefore an arrow from organisational architecture to strategy 
formation is also indicated in figure 1.1.  
8 1.3 STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION AND CONTROL  
In the following seven lessons, we will focus on the important aspect of strategy implementation and 
control and where its fits into the strategic management process. We will also indicate the role of 
organisational architecture in strategy implementation and control. Strategy implementation and control  
refers to all the inform al and formal practices and processes that embed the strategy (as developed 
during strategy formation) in the organisational architecture  and make the strategy a part of the 
organisation's DNA. If you think about building a house, you may realise that it i s a complex business. It is 
not simply about stacking bricks and putting a roof on top. Firstly, there is the process of designing the 
house, and during this process, the rules of structural design and the rules of the municipality have to be 
considered. A rchitectural and engineering capabilities are required to draw up the plans and to calculate 
the costs of the project. Only after the plans have been approved can building begin. During this phase, 
certain skills (e.g. project management, building, plumbin g and electrical installation skills) and 
technologies (e.g. earthmoving equipment) are required. The plans (which are an expression of the vision 
and goals of the architect and the owner) provide the guidelines for what should be built, how it should 
be b uilt and what materials should be used. Building a house (or any other building) entails a complex 
combination of various subsystems. An organisation is also a construction, albeit in more than just the 
physical sense. It involves people, and for that reas on, we could say that organisations are social 
constructions that are constructed by the people who are involved in it. This social construction is in a 
sense also architecture, although it is more fluid than a physical building and continuously evolves. T he 
organisational architecture is a holistic representation of the key subsystems of an organisation and their 
interaction with each other, which can be used to align the operational aspects of an organisation with its 
strategic objectives. At the heart of  the notion of organisational architecture is the idea that the key 
subsystems in the organisation all have to be in balance and consistent with each other. In our framework 
for this module, we used a simplified version of the organisational architecture t hat includes leadership 
and governance, capabilities, structure, technology and culture as the main organisational components.  
Strategic management is essentially about effecting change in the face of internal and external 
environmental factors, and for th at reason, managing strategic change is an important element of 
strategy implementation. This aspect is addressed in lesson 2. Planned change processes are developed 
to align the organisational architecture with the strategy, and for that reason it is more  "top-down" and as 
a result a one -way arrow. But strategy implementation is an iterative and flexible process, and without the 
ability to learn and adapt, organisations will fail at it. For that reason, organisational learning (lesson  
3 ) is also important, as it emphasises the ability of the organisation to dynamically adapt to its 
environment, even to the extent of exerting an influence on strategy formation. In contrast to planned 
change processes, organisational learning is a much more organic and iterati ve process, where elements 
of organisational architecture can "learn" (such as leadership at middle -management level) and can also 
influence strategy formation; for that reason, it is a two -way arrow.  
Strategic choices made by the organisation ultimately h ave to reflect in the organisational architecture. 
This module also addresses the alignment of organisational culture  
9 (lesson 5), the critical role of responsible strategic leadership (lesson 6), and the alignment of 
organisational stru cture (lesson 7) with strategy.  
A large part of strategic success has to do with the allocation of sufficient resources to ensure the 
successful implementation of strategies. This aspect is expanded on in lesson 4. Like planned change 
processes, the purpos e of resource allocation in strategy implementation is to align the organisational 
architecture with the strategy, and as a result it is also a one -way arrow.  
Because the environment is constantly changing, strategy and strategic management can never be static. 
It will always face risks and require interventions in the face of key changes in the environment. For that 
reason, the final Lesson (lesson 8) focuses on strategic control and risk management.

1.4 CONCLUSION  
In this lesson, an overview of strategic management and the traditional strategic management process 
were hi ghlighted. Then, the contemporary strategic management framework, upon which this module is 
based, was introduced. This framework provided you with an indication of the topics that will be 
addressed in each subsequent lesson in this study guide and the cor responding chapters in the 
prescribed book that you need to study. You should now be ready to embark on your study of Strategy 
Implementation and Control. We sincerely hope that you enjoy the journey with us.  
10 Lesson 2  
STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION AS CHANGE 
MANAGEMENT  
Lesson 2 is based on chapter 8 of the prescribed book. You should study this chapter in its entirety to 
provide you with the detailed theory in terms of strategy implementation as change management.  
I refreshed your memo ry in lesson 1 in terms of the contemporary strategic management framework that 
we adopt in this module and in the prescribed book. Lesson 2 is the first lesson that addresses strategy 
implementation as well as a key element thereof, namely change manageme nt. 
Researchers and practitioners agree that strategy implementation is the most difficult part of the strategic 
management process. Research indicates that it is much easier to formulate a strategic plan than to 
implement it and that it is at the implementation stage that strategies often fail. The fact remains - the 
best strategy in the world will get nowhere without efficient and effective operations to implement it. In 
this lesson, we will first focus on strategy implementation and what it essen tially entails, after which we 
will address strategic change and the management thereof.

11 2.1 DEFINING STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION  
Take a moment and formulate your understanding of strategy implementation. You w ill find many 
different definitions of the term "strategy implementation" on the internet and in various strategy 
textbooks. In this module, we will adopt the following definition:  
Strategy implementation is the process during which the organisation draws on both human and non -
human factors in the organisation to ensure that the strategy is executed in line with the plans devised 
during the strategic planning phase. Selected strategies are turned into action in order to realise the 
vision, mission and goals  of the organisation during strategy implementation. It is the phase of the 
strategic management process where management aligns strategic leadership, organisational culture, 
organisational structures, reward systems, policies and resource allocation with the chosen strategies.  
Key Concepts  
Strategy implementation is the process during which the organisation draws on both human 
and non -human factors in the organisation to ensure that the strategy is executed in line with 
the plans devised during the strateg ic planning phase. It is the phase of the strategic 
management process where management aligns strategic leadership, organisa tional culture, 
organisational structures, reward systems, policies and resource allocation with the chosen 
strategies.  
2.2 THE DIFFER ENCES BETWEEN STRATEGY FORMATION AND 
STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION  
Strategy formation and implementation differ from each other in a number of ways:  
• Strategy formation is regarded as the intellectual phase of strategic management, while strategy 
implementation is the "action" phase.  
•  Internal and external forces drive strategy formation, whereas strategy implementation is mainly 
driven by internal, organisational and operations -related forces.  
• Strategy formation requires strategists to be intuitive with good ana lytical and forecasting abilities, 
while strategy implementation requires strategists to have excellent motivation and leadership skills, 
in other words, people -related skills.  
• Strategy formation is regarded as the main responsibility of senior management,  whereas the lower 
or first levels of management are regarded as having the responsibility to implement strategies.  
• Strategy formation is concerned with the overall goals and objectives of the organisation, whereas 
strategy implementation is concerned with  the deliberate choice of a set of activities or steps 
needed to achieve strategic goals.  
• Strategy formation follows a top -down approach - strategic goals and plans are developed that lead 
to the development of tactical and operational goals and plans. On the operational level, goals and 
plans for portfolios, programmes, projects, deliverables and activities are developed. Strategy 
implementation follows a bottom - up approach - the execution of activities will lead to the 
realisation of planned  
12 MNG3702/1  
deliverables, deliverables will realise project goals, the realisation of project goals will lead to the 
realisation of programme and portfolio goals. Then, the realisation of portfolio goals will lead to the 
realisation of operational, tactical and ultimately strategic goals.  
As stated in the introductory paragraph of this lesson, the best strategy in the world will get nowhere 
without effective and efficient operations to implement it. The following case study provides proo f of this 
statement.  
The DaimlerChrysler merger of 1998  
On 7 May 1998, Daimler -Benz Aktiengesellschaft in Germany, the manufacturers of the iconic Mercedes -
Benz range, and Chrysler Corporation in the United States of America (USA), signed a merger contract  to 
establish a new company - DaimlerChrysler AG. The newly formed Aktiengesellschaft  was organised and 
existed under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. Daimler, who proposed the merger and 
dominated the strategy, paid US$35 billion for Chrysler.  The intention of the merger between the two 
companies was twofold - (i) to safeguard its long -term competitiveness, mainly by reducing the new 
company's production costs; and (ii) to increase the new company's footprint dramatically, especially in 
North A merica. Sadly, the merger between the two companies is probably one of the most famous 
international mergers that ended in failure.  
Figure 2.1 illustrates the DaimlerChrysler Management Board responsible for managing DaimlerChrysler 
AG and represents the n ew company in its dealings with third parties. Jurgen E Schrempp from Daimler 
and Robert E Eaton played key roles in the merger process.  
 
Figure 2.1: DaimlerChrysler AG Board of Management  
Group A consisted of board members that represented the following interests in the company:  
• Research and technology  
• Services  
• Aerospace  
• Commercial vehicles  
• Sales and marketing: Mercedes -Benz  
13 Group B consisted of board members that represented the following interests in the company:  
• Passenger cars: Mercedes -Benz  
• Passenger cars and trucks: Chrysler and integration  
• Corporate development  
• Chief financial officer  
• Global purchasing  
Together with the co -chairmen and co -chief executive officers, Group B's board members formed the 
Chairmen's Integration Council.  
Group C consisted of board members that represented the following interests in the company:  
• Sales and marketing: Chrysler  
• Human resources: Daimler -Benz  
• Product strategy and design: Chrysler  
• International: Chrysler  
• Procurement and supply: Chrysler  
• Manufacturing: Chrysler  
In 2007, Daimler sold its Chrysler division in the USA (for which they paid US$35 billion in 1998) to 
Cerbe rus Capital for US$7.4 billion. Cerberus Capital Management took an 80.1% stake in the automaker 
for that amount. The financial performance of Daimler increased dramatically after the sale. Without 
Chrysler, Daimler reported a net profit of €4 billion for the year 2007 (compared to €3.8 billion in 2006). 
Sales rose to €99.4 billion from €99.2 billion. The sheer difference in the amounts of money paid for 
Chrysler by Daimler and later by Cerberus Capital, makes one really wonder how such a promising merger 
could fail so dramatically. "We obviously overestimated the potential of synergies," Dieter Zetsche, chief 
executive of DaimlerChrysler, said at a news conference at the company's headquarters in Stuttgart, 
Germany, after Daimler sold its Chrysler division to Cerberus Capital Management.  
Upon closer examination, the two companies merged, but numerous differences between them hindered 
the success of the merger tremendously. Table 2.1 compares the two companies in terms of the following 
aspects:  
• the attitude of workers towards a formal hierarchy, formal structures and a bureaucratic culture in 
the company  
• the values of the company  
• the trust that existed between Daimler and Chrysler workers after the merger  
• the decision -making process (centralised versus decent ralised)  
• the control process employed  
• the official language employed  
• products offered  
• currency traded

Table 2.1: Comparison between Daimler and Chrysler  
Aspect of comparison  Daimler  Chrysler  
Attitude towards hierarchy and 
structure  Follows a strong and formal 
hierarchy, clear chain of command, 
bureaucratic culture with respect 
for authority. Little payment 
disparity exists between various 
levels in the organisation.  Follows an informal, team - 
oriented and flexible approach.  
Payment disparities between 
various levels in the organisation 
exist.  
Company's values  Values reliability and the highest 
levels of quality.  Focuses on catchy designs and 
offers cars at competitive prices.  
Trust  Daimler workers felt reluctant to 
work with American workers.  
Daimler was imposing and tried to 
dictate the terms on which the 
new merged company should 
work.  Chrysler workers felt reluctant to 
work with German employees.  
Chrysler's employees mistrusted 
Daimler and raised some serious 
communication challenges.  
Chrysler's middle managers and 
engineers saw the merger as a sell -
out to foreigners, and they feared 
an invasion of rigid working 
practices from the German 
company into their own rather 
freewheeling company.  
Decision making  Daimler used centralised decision -
making.  Chrysler workers were used to 
creative and decentralised 
decision -making practices.  
Control  Daimler employed methodical 
control practices.  Chrysler encouraged adaptability 
in control processes.  
Official language  The official language at Daimler 
was German.  The official language at Chrysler 
was English.  
Products offered  High quality, luxurious motor 
vehicles, offered at high prices.  Attractive and comfortable motor 
vehicles were offered at very 
competitive prices.  
Currency  Daimler traded in German marks.  Chrysler traded in US dollars.  
15 An analysis of the differences after the merger, as indicated in table 2.1, indicated a merged company 
with no "deep" integration of activities, processes, cultures and structures. Differences in the first two 
aspects compared in the table, resulted in conflicting orders given by managers to their subordinates and 
the formulation of different goals in different departments. American and German managers had di fferent 
values which drove and directed their work. Different departments were heading in opposing directions. 
The two companies were never integrated into a cohesive whole and the potential synergies that were 
identified as reasons for the merger, went un realised. Furthermore, employees of the two companies did 
not like each other - they could not cooperate to the extent necessary to make the merger a success.  
Mistrust between German and American employees and between management and their subordinates 
were  mainly caused by the realisation that the agreed term "merger -of-equals" did not materialise and 
that it was, in actual fact, a takeover of Chrysler by Daimler. During the initial stages of organisational 
integration, huge bulks of Chrysler's key executiv es either resigned or were replaced by Germans 
counterparts. Poor communications led to sharp decreases in the productivity of the merged companies.  
In theory, the Daimler -Chrysler merger should have yielded two potential sources of competitive 
advantage. The first potential source was cohesive global brand architecture. The second source lay in the 
creation of a coherent platform strategy. The cost of developing new motor vehicles is very high. 
Therefore, manufacturers design "platforms" from which they cr eate families of vehicles. They also try to 
share parts between platforms to drive economies of scale in manufacturing.  
Realising synergy in brand architecture and platform strategy would have required deep integration of 
Daimler and Chrysler. One of the p lans of the merger was for Chrysler to use Daimler parts, components 
and even vehicle architecture to sharply reduce the cost to produce future vehicles. Unfortunately, 
problems surfaced when Daimler's Mercedes - Benz luxury division, whose components Chrys ler were 
supposed to use, was reluctant to share with its mass -market partner. In return, Daimler had hoped that 
Chrysler would dramatically increase its footprint in the promised land of auto sales - North America. Due 
to increased competition from Asian motor car manufacturers, Chrysler fell short. The management team 
needed to develop a global brand strategy and associated logic of competitive positioning. None of this 
happened. Management of the merged company managed the two companies as separate opera tions.  
Only two years after the merger, the new company admitted that it needed to deal with many barriers 
that prohibit it from realising its initial merger goals. Over and above the differences between the two 
merged companies (indicated in table 2.1), time differences between the US and Germany also posed a 
big problem - managers from both companies crisscross the Atlantic in a stream of meetings and 
workshops, seeking ways to drive down expenditures and share future development costs. People such as 
Mr Hubbert from Daimler (member of the Chairmen's Integration Council and responsible for Passenger 
cars: Mercedes -Benz), acknowledged that Daimler, seeking to solve strategic problems of its own, had 
engineered a friendly takeover of the American car manufa cturer. The merged company also faced 
financial problems. It was admitted that renewed cost -cutting efforts had to be undertaken to improve its 
operating results. The merged company  
16  
MNG3702/1  
also realised the importance of communica tion with investors when its share price fell more than 40% in 
1999, only one year after the merger. Competition in the motor vehicle industry intensified, especially in 
Chrysler's home market. At the time of the merger, share options became hugely availab le, which resulted 
in senior Chrysler managers becoming rich. This triggered concern in Germany. Furthermore, Americans 
were remunerated two, three or even four times as much as their German equivalents. Management also 
needed to coordinate hundreds of int egration projects, for which they formed an automotive council of 
five senior managers to which all projects needed to report every four to six weeks. Despite all 
management efforts, the merger culminated in failure - one that will long be discussed in man agement 
and strategy studies.

2.3 BARRIERS TO SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION  
In the introductory paragraph of this lesson, we noted that strateg y implementation is the most difficult 
part of the strategic management process and that it is much easier to formulate a strategic plan than to 
implement it. You may now ask the question why it is so difficult to implement strategies. Kaplan and 
Norton (2 001) identified the following four main barriers to successful strategy implementation:  
The people barrier. Organisational management does not link incentives to strategy implementation, 
which is indicated as a people barrier.  
The vision barrier. Organisational management does not ensure that its workforce has a thorough 
understanding of the strategy that the organisation intends to implement in order to realise its vision, 
which is indicated as the vision barrier.  
The management barrier. Executive  teams do not spend sufficient time managing organisational strategy, 
which is indicated as the management barrier.  
The resource barrier. Organisations do not link sufficient resources to strategy execution, which is referred 
to as the resource barrier.  
Barriers to successful strategy implementation:  
• people barrier  
• vision barrier  
• management barrier  
• resource barrier  
Activity  
Read the case study on the DaimlerChrysler merger of 1998. Can you identify Kaplan  
and Norton's four barriers to successful strategy implementation in the DaimlerChrysler  
case? Substantiate your answer.  
Feedback  
Kaplan and Norton's four main barriers to strategy implementation is clearly evident from this 
failed merger between Daimler and Chrysler:  
• The people barrier. No incentives were  directly linked to the merger. In fact, at the time of 
the merger, share options became hugely available which resulted in senior Chrysler 
managers becoming rich. This triggered concern in Germany. Furthermore, Americans were 
remunerated two, three or eve n five times as much as their German equivalents.  
 
18  
MNG3702/1  
• The vision barrier. Daimler and Chrysler were head ing in different directions; employees 
had no idea nor understanding of the strategy that the new organisation was implementing 
in order to realise its vision. The two companies were never integrated as a cohesive whole 
and the potential synergies that wer e identified as reasons for the merger went unrealised.  
• The management barrier. Managers gave different orders to employees, and formulated 
different goals for different departments. American and German managers had different 
values which drove and directe d their work.  
• The resource barrier. There was no evidence of resources allocated to implement the 
merger strategy effectively.  
Questions for discussion on the myUnisa Discussion Forums  
Evaluate your current position in the organisation that you are working  for. Can you identify  
Kaplan and Norton's barriers to successful strategy implementation in the organisation?  
Can you think of ways that the organisation can overcome these barriers?  
The next question that you can now ask, is "how" an organisation can ove rcome the barriers to 
successful strategy implementation. This is the focus of the next section.  
2.4 PRINCIPLES OF STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION  
In order to overcome the barriers to successful strategy implementation explained in the previous 
section, various principles should be followed. Kaplan and Norton (2001) highlight five principles, which 
they call the "principles of a strategy -focused organisation":  
• Principle 1: Translate the strategy into operational terms. The first principle refers to the translatio n 
of the corporate strategy into the logical architecture of a strategy map and balanced scorecard 
(BSC) to specify the details of the critical elements of the corporate strategy. A strategy map is 
drawn up by specifying strategic objectives for each eleme nt (financial, customer, internal business 
processes, learning and growth) of the BSC.  
• Principle 2: Align the organisation to its corporate strategy. Organisations consist of various sectors, 
business units and functional departments, each with its own ope rations and often, each with its 
own strategies. Functional departments, such as finance, marketing, procurement and so on, have 
their own bodies of knowledge, language and culture. Functional silos may arise and become a 
major barrier in successful strate gy implementation, since organisations may have trouble in 
communicating and coordinating activities across these specialised functions. For an organisation to 
create synergy (to be more than the sum of its various parts), individual strategies must be ali gned, 
integrated and linked. Therefore, the second principle involves the creation of synergy and to ensure 
that these linkages actually occur, in other words, the alignment of all hierarchical levels (business 
units, functional units and individual employ ees) to the strategy.  
• Principle 3: Make strategy everybody's job. Senior management and other strategists cannot 
implement strategies on their own - they need the actions and ideas from everyone in the 
organisation. The third principle requires that all em ployees understand  
19 the strategy and conduct their day -to-day activities in such a way that they contribute  
to the success of the strategy.  
• Principle 4: Strategy as a continual process. The fourth principle introduces strategic  
management as a double -loop process, which integrates the management of tactics  
with the management of strategy.  
• Principle 5: Mobilise leadership for change. Principles 1 to 4, focus on the BSC tool,  
framework and the processes that support it. Becoming a truly strategy -focused  
organisation requires more than tools and processes. Firstly, it requires ownership  
and involvement of the executive team. Secondly, it requires change from virtually  
every part of the organisation.  
Activity  
Read the case study on th e DaimlerChrysler merger of 1998. Study chapter 3 of the  
prescribed book, specifically the section that explains the balanced scorecard. Design a  
strategic map for DaimlerChrysler AG. For each element of the balanced scorecard, you  
should specify at least two strategic objectives.  
 
Feedback  
FINANCIAL: (i) Reduce operating costs, (ii) Increase revenue and profits especially in North 
America  
CUSTOMER: (i) Increase global brand architecture, (ii) Increase awareness as global industry 
leader  
INTERNAL BUSINESS PROCESSES: (i) Create families of vehicles, (ii) Share parts between 
platforms to drive economies of scale in manufacturing  
LEARNI NG AND GROWTH: (i) Increase expertise, (ii) Optimise technology  
Change is a fundamental strategy implementation issue. In the next section, our focus turns to a 
discussion of strategic change and the management thereof.  
2.5 CHANGE - A FUNDAMENTAL STRATEGY 
IMPLEMENTATION ELEMENT  
There is general agreement that the rate and pace of change facing organisations are greater now than 
they have ever been. As a verb, the term "change" can be defined as the action to make the form, nature, 
content or future course o f something different from what it is or from what it would be if left alone. 
Being "strategic" is not business as usual but requires large and sustained organisational change. 
Therefore, we can define strategic as "deep" organisational change that seeks t o improve an 
organisation's competitive  
20  
MNG3702/1  
position through improving certain of its features. Strategic change involves a change in the strategic 
direction of the organisation and the implementation of new strategies, involvi ng major changes to the 
normal or previous routines in the organisation.

Questions for discussion on the myUnisa Discussion Forums  
• From your own experience of strategic change initiatives, what are the key factors that de termine 
their success or failure?  
• What role do strategic managers play in implementing strategic change?  
• In your experience, what is the biggest or most frequent barrier to successful strategic change?  
Various types of strategic change can be found in organisations. In the next section, we focus on these.  
2.6 TYPES OF STRATEGIC CHANGE  
Strategic change can take many  forms, for example a change in the organisation's  
• vision, mission, strategy, goals and objectives  
• products and/or services that it offers  
•  market to which it offers its products and/or services  
•  processes used to offer products and/or services to the market  
• technology used to offer products and/or services to the market  
 
21  
• values, corporate culture and/or shared beliefs  
• outcomes, the way in which people work, or its performance  
• location (including internationalisation)  
• structure  
Strategic change can be classified based on two variables, namely (i) the extent of the  
change required, and (ii) the speed of the change that is to be achieved. Based on these  
two variables, the following four types of strategic changes are distinguished:  
• Evolution (transformation; incremental). Evolutionary change refers to tr ansformational change that 
is implemented gradually (or incrementally) through inter -related initiatives.  
• Adaptation (realignment; incremental). Adaptation change refers to change undertaken to realign 
the way in which the organisation operates.  
• Revolution  (transformation; "big bang"). This refers to transformational change that occurs through 
simultaneous initiatives on many aspects.  
• Reconstruction (realignment; "big bang"). This refers to change undertaken to realign the way in 
which the organisation oper ates with many initiatives implemented simultaneously.  
Types of strategic change:  
• evolution  
• revolution  
• adaptation  
• reconstruction

technology that could deliver innovative travel to consumers and travel agencies in South Africa 
(Sabre Airline Solutions). In addition, Comair launched travel and holiday packages - a major 
strategic change.  
22  
MNG3702/1  
In this section, our focus was on the various types of strategic change. In the next section, our focus turns 
to the models of planned change.  
2.7 MODELS OF PLANNED CHANGE  
The majority of models of change management are founded on the notion that change can be viewed as 
a planned activity that requires management. In this context, planned change can be defined as an 
approach to manage change that assumes that change is an activity that can be managed, organised and 
led by the sen ior management of an organisation. The notion that change can be viewed as a planned 
activity, is also predicated upon the assumption that an organisation can move from one stable state to 
another. Models of planned change can be classified as either "best  practice" or "analytical" models. Best 
practice models of planned change suggest that there is a recipe that can be learned for managing 
change successfully, while analytical models provide a framework to help explain the process of 
managing a change prog ramme. It has to be recognised that change is a messy, very difficult and 
unpredictable process. In what follows, we will first focus on the best -practice models of planned change, 
after which the analytical models will be addressed.  
2.7.1  Best -practice models o f 
planned change  
John Kotter is widely regarded as one of the leading experts in change management, and his eight -step 
change process is perhaps the best -known best -practice model of planned change. The eight steps in his 
model are summarised below:  
John K otter's eight step change process:  
Step 1: Establishing a sense of urgency  
Step 2: Creating a guiding coalition  
Step 3: Developing a change vision  
Step 4: Communicating the vision for buy -in 
Step 5: Empowering broad -based action  
Step 6: Generating short -term wins  
Step 7: Sustaining acceleration  
Step 8: Incorporating changes into the culture  
2.7.2   Analytical models of planned change  
Analytical models suggest that change management programmes should proceed through various 
phases - they do not prescribe sp ecific actions that managers should take. One of the most widely cited 
analytical models of planned changed is that of Kurt Lewin, who argued that change comprises three 
stages. These stages are summarised on the following page:  
23  
Kurt Lewin's change model:  
Stage 1: Unfreezing 
Stage 2: Changing 
Stage 3: Freezing  
Based on Lewin's model, Balogun and Hope -Hailey developed a change kaleidoscope, which is founded 
on the principle that change needs to be context -specific and that the appr oach to change that the 
organisation chooses should be based on a thorough analysis of the following: (i) the context within 
which change is taking place and (ii) a series of decisions around the way in which the change is to be 
managed. The model divides the context within which change is taking place into the following eight core 
segments (Balogun & Hope Hailey 2008):  
Segments of Balogun and Hope -Hailey's change kaleidoscope:  
• power  
• time 
• scope  
• preservation  
• diversity  
• capability  
• capacity  
• readiness  
Based on the analysis of the context of the organisational change, Balogun and Hope - Hailey argued that 
those leading the change need to make the following key decisions around the way in which the change 
process will be managed:  
Balogun and Hope -Hailey's ways of managing the change 
process:  
• change path  
• change start point  
• change style  
• change target  
• change levers  
• change roles  
The change kaleidoscope model recognises that it is virtually impossible to map all contextual variables 
with any one best-practice approach. It acknowledges the need to account for a wide range of 
organisational situations.  
24 MNG3702/1  
Activity  
The change kaleidoscope model can be applied to any kind of change - not only in the 
context of organisational and strategic changes. Think of change you are either planning or 
have recently been through in your personal life, such as a moving house or changing your 
job. 
(1) What were the contextual variables and how did you go about managing the change 
process?  
(2) What does the application of the change kaleidoscope model tell you about how 
effectively you managed the change?  
Feedback  
(1) Should you take changing your job as an example, contextual variables are crucial to 
consider. For example, the powerful sta keholders in relation to the change could be your 
family members, current employers and potential employers. You also need to consider the 
time that you have available to make the decision to change your job. The effect of the 
decision should be determined  - financially, socially and so on. Critical things that you 
want/need to maintain should you change your job should be determined, for example 
should your family not want to move. Your capacity to make the change and your readiness 
should also be consider ed. Then, you also need to decide how you will manage the change 
in terms of where to start (change start point), the inputs that you will use (change style), 
the change target, the change levers and the change roles.  
(2) The application of the change kaleidos cope model will tell you that you achieved the set 
outcomes/objectives of changing your job, taking into consideration all affected parties.  
It is important to note that the pace of change in contemporary organisations is such that change is a 
constant state that requires managing, which leaves little or sometimes even no time for recovery (or 
freezing/sustaining) in between. Also, change often emerges in an unplanned and non -linear manner as a 
result of changes in the external environment. Change may al so develop bottom -up, as people, 
sometimes unconsciously, change the way that they work over time, to become more effective and 
efficient. Change can therefore also be seen as an open -ended process of adaptation and organisational 
learning, which will be a ddressed in more detail in lesson 3.

2.8 BARRIERS TO SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIC CHANGE AND 
WAYS TO OVERCOME THEM  
Despite all the research in the field of change management, evidence continues to suggest that most 
change efforts fail to meet their objectives (Bailey, Mankin, Kelliher & Garavan 2018). The prescribed book 
explains some of the reasons for the failure of change efforts and ways to overcome th em, as summarised 
in figure 2.1 below.  
Lack of strategic planning 
and leadership  Failure to look ahead  
Failure to anticipate the impact of change on the 
organisation  
Structural reasons  • Organisational structure does not support the change  
Cultural reasons  • Change requires a paradign shift that is far removed 
from the current paradigm  
System reasons  • Current systems are inadequate to deal with strategic 
changes  
Process reasons  Lack of communication  
Poor time management  
Not dealing with resistance to change  
Insufficient reinforcing mechanisms

2.9 CONCLUSION  
In this lesson, we addressed strategy implementation as change management. It should be evident from 
our discussions, that strategy implementation is a challenging task and that it should be approached with 
caution and care. Secondly, strategic change in inevitable and it should be managed in such a way that all 
the benefits thereof are reaped and th at barriers are overcome. The next lesson addresses the learning 
organisation.  
27 Lesson 3  
THE LEARNING ORGANISATION  
Lesson 3 is based on chapter 9 of the prescribed book. You should study this  
chapter in its entirety to provide you with the detailed theory in terms of the  
learning organisation.  
In lesson 2, we introduced you to strategy implementation as change management. We  
explored various planned strategic change models and made the important statement  
that strategic change does not a lways happen in a planned and managed way. One  
could argue that most change happens inorganically and unplanned as individuals and  
organisations learn and adapt to their environment. In this lesson, we explore the topic  
of organisational learning and the i mportance thereof in strategy implementation. Also,  
we explain the importance of organisational learning in innovation and change.  
Learning Outcomes  
After you have completed this lesson, you should be able to  
• define a learning organisation  
• critically evaluate whether an organisation is a learning  organisation  
• identify the implications of whether an organisation is  a learning  organisation or  
not for strategy implementation  
• explain the barriers to organisational learning  
• explain the individual learning p rocess  
• explain the transfer of knowledge to others  
• make recommendations on how an organisation can become a learning organisation  
3.1 DEFINING A LEARNING ORGANISATION  
Take a moment and think about the following question - can organisations learn? Individuals learn, not 
organisations. Individuals in organisations need to learn before organisational learning can take place. 
Organisational learning is imperative for the long term survival and success of the organisation. A learning 
organisation is defined as an o rganisation skilled in creating, acquiring and transferring knowledge and 
at modifying its behaviour to reflect new knowledge and insights. The process of organisational learning, 
as depicted in figure 3.1 below, is an ongoing and continuous process.

Figure 3.1: The organisational learning process gM| Key 
Concepts  
A learning organisation is an organisation skilled in creating, acquiring and transferring 
knowledge and at modifying its behaviour to reflect new knowledge and insights.  
If you think about your present situation as a student, employee or even an employer, you will agree that 
individual learning is not always continuous, not always guaranteed and not always a natural process for 
all people. In the same way, not all organisations are learning organisations. In the next section, we 
address the various barriers to organisational learning.  
3.2 BARRIERS TO ORGANISATIONAL LEARNING  
Very few organisations are truly good at organisational learning. The following are barriers  
to organisational learning:  
• Dominant general management logic. This stems from the way that managers conceptualise 
business and then make critical decisions about the s trategy and allocation of resources based on 
this. The more dominant the logic, the more it acts as a barrier to learning and change. Unlearning 
needs to take place to pave the way for new learning and new models to be implemented and to 
allow for new domi nant logics to be established.  
•  Management ignorance. It can also happen that managers assume that they know all there is to 
know about their business and the industry in which they operate and that there is no need to learn 
more, which present a barrier to learning.  
• Limits to absorptiv e capacity. Absorptive capacity refers to the ability of an organisation to recognise 
the value of new, external information, to assimilate it and  
29 to use it to address business problems. Absorptive capacity is a strategic capability, a nd as with all 
resources and capabilities, it differs from organisation to organisation, so that some have a higher 
absorptive capacity that others, and would accordingly be able to learn much faster and to adapt 
more quickly to their environments, or to i nnovate.  
To critically evaluate whether an organisation is a learning organisation or not, one needs to address 
these three aspects (its dominant general management logic, management ignorance and the 
organisation's limits to absorptive capacity).  
The following case study provides an example of two companies, one that proved to be good at 
organisational learning and one not that good.  
Kodak is at death's door; Fujifilm, its old rival, is thriving. Why?  
The Eastman Kodak Company (referred to simply as Ko dak) is an American technology company founded 
in 1888 when it was known for its pioneering technology and innovative marketing. "You press the 
button, we do the rest," was its slogan in 1988. By 1976 Kodak accounted for 90% of film and 85% of 
camera sales  in America. Until the 1990s it was regularly rated as one of the world's five most valuable 
brands. The company's ubiquity was such that its "Kodak moment" tagline entered the common lexicon 
to describe a personal event that demanded to be recorded for po sterity. The company built one of the 
world's first digital cameras in 1975.  
Then came digital photography to replace film, and smartphones to replace cameras. Kodak's revenues 
peaked at nearly US$16 billion in 1996, and its profits at US$2.5 billion in 19 99. Then Kodak's financial 
struggle began as a result of the decline in sales of photographic film and its inability to adapt to a world 
in which digital photography had become pervasive and available in just about every cellular telephone.  
Fujifilm Holdin gs Corporation, better known as Fujifilm, is a Japanese company and one of Kodak's 
competitors. Fujifilm is very similar to Kodak in many aspects, but has been faring much better in the age 
of pervasive digital photography. Both companies have seen their t raditional business being rendered 
obsolete and both companies have been aware of the advent of digital photography. Whereas Kodak has 
been unable to adapt to this new environment, Fujifilm has successfully weathered the storm and is still 
today a profitab le and sustainable company. Observers point to a number of key differences that led to 
Fujifilm adapting more successfully to its changing environment than Kodak.  
The first difference can be found in corporate culture. Kodak had a culture of complacency, ironically 
cultivated by its massive success and near monopoly in instant film photography in the USA. Despite its 
strengths - hefty investment in research, a rigorous approach to manufacturing and good relations with 
its local community - Kodak has become  a complacent monopolist. Fujifilm was also aware of the threat 
of digital photography surging towards it like a tsunami by the 1980s, but in response, it developed a 
three pronged strategy. Firstly, Fujifilm squeezed as much money out of the film business  for as long as 
possible. Secondly, Fuji prepared for the switch to digital photography. Lastly, Fuji diversified into new 
lines of business.  
30 MNG3702/1  
The second difference between Kodak and Fuji, can be found in the inconsistency in the Kodak leadership, 
which meant that Kodak's strategies changed with every new CEO. As a result, the company was never 
able to diversify successfully. For example, George Fisher, CEO from 1993 until 1999, focused on Kodak's 
expertise in digital imaging r ather than in chemicals, and mass -produced digital cameras until camera 
phones destroyed that business. The latest CEO, Antonio Perez, who took charge in 2005, insisted that 
digital printing would save Kodak. At Fuji, technological change sparked an intern al power struggle. At 
first, participants in the consumer film business, who refused to see the looming crises, prevailed. But the 
eventual winner was Shigetaka Komori, who chided them as "lazy" and "irresponsible" for not preparing 
better for the digital onslaught. Named boss incrementally between 2000 and 2003, he set about 
overhauling the company. He spent around US$9 billion on 40 companies since 2000. He slashed costs 
and jobs. In one 19 -month period, he booked more than ¥250 billion in restructuring c osts for 
depreciation and to shed superfluous distributors, development labs, managers and researchers. "It was a 
painful experience," says Mr Komori. "But to see the situation as it was, nobody could survive. So we had 
to reconstruct the business model".  
The third difference between the Kodak and Fujifilm companies can be found in its ability to compete in a 
changing market environment. Kodak executives were not used to competing in a high -technology world 
in which speed -to-market is critical to success. H ence, they were more committed to making perfect 
products than to getting products into the market as quickly as possible and fixing the shortcomings in 
later models. Even when Kodak decided to diversify, it took years to make its first acquisition. It cre ated a 
widely admired venture -capital arm, but never made big enough bets to create breakthroughs. By 
contrast, rather than simply trying to convert its film camera business to a digital camera business, Fujifilm 
tapped its chemical expertise for other use s. Film is a bit like skin - both contain collagen. Just as photos 
fade because of oxidation, cosmetic firms would like you to think that skin is preserved with antioxidants. 
In Fuji's library of 200 000 chemical compounds, 4 000 are related to antioxidant s. Therefore, the 
company launched a line of cosmetics which is sold in Asia and Europe. Fuji also successfully branched 
out into other pharmaceuticals, liquid -crystal display (LCD) panels for television sets and other electronic 
devices. Today, Fujifilm m akes only 1% of its revenue from photographic film.  
The fourth difference between the companies can be found in its ability to identify target markets for the 
future. While many high -technology companies were achieving great success in emerging markets, 
Kodak's failure to read the emerging markets correctly cost the company dearly. Emerging markets 
generally switched early on from analogue to digital, many emerging markets leapfrogging from having 
no cameras straight to using digital on the back of the rapi d adoption of cellular telephone technology.  
Whereas Fujifilm has mastered new tactics and survived, Kodak, like so many great companies before it, 
seems to have run its course and is on the brink of simply fading away.

Activity  
Read the Kodak is at death's door; Fujifilm, its old rival, is thriving. Why? case study at  
http://www.economist.com/node/21542796 . What were the barriers to organisational 
learning that prevented Kodak from successfully adapting to a digital world? Provide specific 
examples from the case study.  
Feedback  
The main barriers were the following:  
Constrained thinking. The dominant logic of the Kodak management team was that they were a 
camera and digital imaging company. This clearly constrained their thinking, and their search for 
new opportunities was limited to opportunities related to the camer a business. For example, 
when they entered the emerging Chinese market, it was with the intent of selling photographic 
film rather than digital imaging.  
Ignorance and lack of foresight on the part of management. Management's ignorance was 
evident from the fact that Kodak executives were not sure how to compete in the fast - moving 
technology market. Rather than getting products to the market as quickly as possible and fixing 
them in due course, they wanted to launch perfect products, which meant that they al ways 
lagged behind their more technology -oriented competitors, such as Sony and Canon.  
A lack of absorptive capacity. Kodak was also limited by its lack of absorptive capacity. Factors 
such as those mentioned above and its complacent mind set limited Kodak  in identifying 
relevant information from the environment. Despite their specific efforts to identify diversification 
opportunities, they were not able to diversify significantly. Ironically, regardless of their early 
entry into the digital camera market, they were never able to combine this with new information 
to identify new opportunities.  
Barriers to organisational learning:  
• dominant general management logic  
• management ignorance  
• limits to absorptive capacity  
Just as individuals need to learn continuously, organisations need to learn and adapt continuously. The 
Kodak and Fujifilm case study provided us with an illustration of the implications of a learning 
organisation such as Fujifilm, namely a sustainable organisation that survives and achiev es great success 
in an emerging market, as opposed to an organisation that lacks learning such as Kodak, which seems to 
have run its course and is on the brink of simply fading away.

3.3 INDIVIDUAL LEARNING  
Individual learning, as an important part of organisational learning, can be defined as a change in 
behaviour or perform ance as a result of experience. The individual learning process is regarded as a 
cycle, consisting of four activities as depicted in figure 3.2 below.

 Feedback  
If we consider Fujifilm and Kodak, both companies had the foreknowledge that digital  
photography was coming, and both altered their behaviour in response. The key difference  
was the way in which the two companies interpreted (made sense of) the threat and accordingly  
altered their behaviour. While Kodak simply at tempted to adapt to the new technology, Fujifilm  
fundamentally (and successfully) changed its business model - something that Kodak was  
never able to do. Fujifilm experimented successfully and tapped its chemical expertise for  
other uses, successfully bran ching out into pharmaceuticals, liquid -crystal display panels for  
television sets and other electronic devices.  
Questions for discussion on myUnisa Discussion Forums  
In his book 21 lessons for the 21st century, Professor Yuval Noah Harari states that none of the skills that 
we learn today will be applicable 20 years from now.  
• Do you agree with this statement?  
• What implications does this statement have for individual learning and organisational learning?  
Individual learning becomes even more worthwhile when it is transferred to others. The next section 
focuses on transferring knowledge to others.  
Knowledge is broadly categorised as being explicit or tacit. Explicit knowledge is knowledge that can be 
written down or told to someone, whereas tacit knowledge con sists of personal beliefs, values and 
perspectives that people take for granted and that may be much more difficult to communicate. We can 
differentiate between four basic types of knowledge transfer, namely socialisation (tacit ^ tacit), 
combination (expl icit ^ explicit), internalisation (explicit ^ tacit) and articulation (tacit ^ explicit).  
In section 2, we indicated that learning organisations are characterised by success and that they will 
survive over the long term. They question that we now need to answer is how can an organisation 
become a learning organisation. We address this in the next section.  
Becoming a learning organisation requires a deep -seated change in the way that the organisation and its 
leaders view the world. Various mechanisms, to be  used in combination, are proposed to assist an 
organisation to become a learning one. These mechanisms are as follows:  3.4 TRANSFERRING KNOWLEDGE TO OTHERS  
Types of knowledge transfer:  
• socialisation  
• combination  
• internalisation  
• articulation  
3.5 BECOMING A LEARNING  ORGANISATION  
34 MNG3702/1  
Leadership commitment to learning. Leaders should demonstrate their own commitment by being 
models of learning, championing learning and using learning strategically for business results.  
Building shared visions. Leaders need to develop genuine visions that can inspire employees.  
Encouraging diversity. Top management should encourage diversity. Encouraging double -loop 
learning. Top management should encourage double loop learning.  
Developing systems thinki ng abilities. The members of the organisation need to understand how 
they are connected to the world, how they fit into their environment, how they are influenced by it 
and how they can influence it in turn.  
Encouraging individual and team learning. Be com mitted to life -long learning. Legitimising dissent. 
Everybody should think and contribute ideas.  
Encouraging experimentation. See failure as learning opportunities. Establishing communities of 
practice. This refers to collaboration with suppliers, customer s and even competitors.  
Knowledge management: Management should ensure that organisational knowledge is shared in 
order to support organisational learning.

35 Activity  
Revisit the Kodak is at death's door; Fujifilm, its old rival, is thriving. Why? case study. From an 
organisation learning perspective, what could Kodak have done differently that could have 
resulted in it adapting more successfully to its changing environment? Provide at least five 
specific actions.  
Feedback  
A single correct answer to this question is not possible, as it depends on your own insight and 
creativity. However, some possible practical steps Kodak could have taken to increase its 
organisational ability to learn are identified based on the concepts discussed in this section. Feel 
free to add your own examples.  
The fact that every CEO had a different plan for Kodak, suggests that there was  no shared vision. 
By contrast, Fujifilm executives collectively identified a plan of action very early on and were 
committed to their revised vision. Therefore, the first action should be to  build a strong shared 
vision for the company, after which clear objectives and strategies should be formulated.  
Although we do not know the exact composition of the Kodak management team, the case 
suggests that "group think" was a problem. Had Kodak been able to engender  more diversity in 
its management team, especiall y by including executives from other industries, they may have 
approached their strategies differently. Kodak seemed to be stuck in single -loop learning, simply 
adjusting its strategies every time they failed until it ran out of options. Instead, executive s should 
have fundamentally re -evaluated their business model and the way in which they did things to 
reinvent the organisation - in other words they should have encouraged double -loop learning. 
Challenging the existing mental models (e.g. of being a digit al imaging company) would have 
been an important starting point for this process.  
Collaboration with other industry players, such as Sony, could have encouraged new thinking 
and opened up new ways of doing things.  
Kodak appeared to be very reluctant to exp eriment but, by delaying acquisitions and product 
launches, the management team denied itself the opportunity to learn, even if it meant learning 
by failing.

36 3.6 CONCLUSION  
In this lesson, organisational learning was discussed as an important capability of organisations to survive 
over the long term and to ensure their success. It is important to note that organisation learning is a vital 
element of strategy implementation - learning organisations are successful and are able to survive over 
the long term whereas organisations that are unable to learn and adapt have slim chances of survival and 
success. The next lesson, addresses another important element of strategy implementation, namely 
resource allocation.  
37 Lesson 4  
RESOURCE ALLOCATION FOR STRATEGY 
IMPLEMENTATION  
Lesson 4 is based on chapter 10 of the prescribed book. You should study this chapter in its entirety to 
provide you with the detailed theory in terms of resource allocation for strategy implementation.  
Take a moment and think about the resources at the disposal of your household - they are  scarce and 
expensive, are they not? Therefore, the use of resources, be it money, water or food, needs to be done 
with discretion and allocated in such a manner that the household functions well and that every member 
of the household gets what he or she n eeds. The same applies to an organisation - resources are scarce 
and need to be allocated in such a manner that they are aligned with the vision, mission, goals and 
strategies of the organisation. In this lesson, we address the complex matter of resource a llocation for 
strategy implementation.  
 Learning Outcomes  
After you have completed this lesson, you should be able to  
•  explain what re source allocation for strategy implementation entails  
•  explain what the strategy execution framework entails  
• critically evaluate the application of the six domains of the strategy execution frame work 
by an organisation  
• explain the steps to be followed in the management of strategic initiatives and apply 
these steps in a given situation  
• explain the creation of an environment for effective resource allocation  
4.1 RESOURCE ALLOCATION FOR STRATEGY 
IMPLEMENTATION  
Before we answer the question "what does resource allocation for strategy implementation entail?", let us 
first take a few steps backward and have a look at the organisation as a system that needs inputs 
(resources), and how these resources are transformed to produce outputs. The resources are human 
resou rces, capital, natural resources, entrepreneurship and information, while the outputs are the 
products and/or services, job creation, the wealth of the community, and so on. We can also list the 
strategic objectives of the organisation as an important outp ut that the organisation wants to achieve by 
transforming the outputs to inputs. One important feature of the organisation as a system is that 
resources  
38 MNG3702/1  
are scarce and very expensive. Think of high interest rates in terms of accessing capital, the scarcity of 
electricity, the scarcity of skilled labour and the cost of data to mention only a few examples. On the 
other hand, the need for products and services delivered by the organisation is unlimited and the 
organisation also w ants to achieve its goals and strategic objectives as much as it possibly can. This 
emphasises the importance of allocating resources for strategy implementation - which is not only the 
responsibility of top managers. Each individual in an organisation sho uld be aware of the long -term plan 
for the organisation and his or her contribution to that plan.  
Resource allocation for strategy implementation consists of the following three key elements:  
•  successful implementation of strategic initiatives  
•  successful alignment of organisational units with the strategic direction of the organisation  
• successful alignment of individual behaviour with strategic direction  
 Key Concepts  
Elements of resource allocation:  
• successful implementation of strategic initiatives  
•  successful alignment of organisational units with strategic direction  
•  successful alignment of individual behaviour with strategic direction  
Allocating resources for strategy implementation, to ensure the attainment of strategic goals, entails the 
following:  
4.1.1  Align organisational units with strategic direction  
All the dimensions in the hierarchy of organisational strategy (i.e. the organisational, strategic business 
units and functional units) should be aligned and should support one another. Ultimately, the 
contributions of each functional unit and each strategic busin ess unit should contribute to the strategic 
direction of the organisation and should lead to the attainment of the organisational goals, mission and 
vision.  
4.1.2  Align individual behaviour with strategic direction  
The behaviour and outputs of each individual em ployee should also be aligned with the strategic 
direction of the organisation. In other words, the contributions of each worker, each functional unit and 
each strategic business unit should contribute to the strategic direction of the organisation and sho uld 
lead to the attainment of the organisational goals, mission and vision. Five tools that can be used to 
achieve this are recruiting the right people, implementing training and development programmes, 
implementing policies and procedures to guide the beh aviours of individuals, cascading objectives lower 
down in the organisation, and using reward systems that are tailored to reward behaviours and 
achievements that are in line with the strategic direction of the organisation.  
39 4.1.3  Implement strategic initiatives  
Implement key projects or programmes focused on achieving a specific objective or improving 
performance to achieve a performance target.  
4.1.4  Implement enablers of resource allocation  
This involves the implementation of three enablers, namely to communicate the strategy, to learn and 
adapt, and to allocate adequate resources.  
4.1.5  Align strategy with the internal environment  
This involves the alignment of all organisational units and employees with organisational strategies and its 
strategic direction.  
Shoprite is a household name in South Africa. Shoprite Holdings Ltd is the largest su - 
permarket retailer on the African continent with the promise to "serve local communi - 
ties with the lowest prices". Across Africa, the group has 16 brands in 15 countries, with  
2 425 corporate outlets and 418 franchise outlets (https://www.shopriteholdings.co.za/ ).

Feedback  
For the Shoprite Group, providing its customers with the lowest possible prices is a key element of 
its success. At corporate level, the focus may be to grow by increasing corporate and franchise 
outlets. Since the group is listed on the JSE, the return on shareholders’ equity may be an 
example of a metric related to this goal. As a strategy, the Group may be looking to expand its 
investment into e -commerce. At  the business level, the focus may be on low -cost leadership. The 
objective may be to increase sales volume. An example of a metric may be the gross profit 
margin. (The gross profit margin is calculated by dividing the gross profit of an organisation by 
its sales. A declining gross profit will mean that mark -ups have been reduced in order to increase 
sales revenue). The Group may follow a strategy of a decline in its gross profit margin, which will 
lead to lower profits - lower profits will be offset by inc reasing sales volume. The strategy for 
achieving higher sales volumes may be through innovative advertising and the use of 
technology. At the functional level, the marketing department needs to play an active role in 
innovative advertising, especially usin g social media and other innovative ideas. On the 
operational and individual level, Shoprite could cultivate a culture of innovation and remunerate 
employees for new ideas and positive contributions to the strategic direction of the company.  
4.2 THE STRATEGY E XECUTION FRAMEWORK  
The Strategic Execution Framework® (SEF) is a resource allocation framework that helps to align an 
organisation's projects and programmes with its strategies. The purpose of the SEF is to help 
organisations to better align activities and  strategic direction. According to this framework, there are six 
key aspects or domains, each with a number of components, in an organisation that must harmonise in 
resource allocation. Each of the domains are unpacked below. You will notice that the compo nents of the 
various domains overlap with one another.  
1. Ideation. An organisation's identity and how it sees itself and how it wants to ap pear to the world.  
 
41 2. Nature. Creating the conditions for strategy execution, nature  embodies the culture  
and structure, in other words, the environment and the context, within which the organisation 
operates.

4.3 MANAGING STRATEGIC INITIATIVES  
In this module, we make a clear distinction between the concepts leadership  and management,  which we 
will address in detail in chapter 12 of the prescribed book and in lesson 6. For now, it will suffice if we 
state that managers deal with complexity in organisations and perform the planning, organising, leading 
and control functions to attain organisational goals in an environmental characterised by change. Leaders, 
on the other hand, need to deal  with change, stemming from business environments characterised by 
major, ongoing changing factors and variables.  
In the context of resource allocation, both leaders and managers are required. The strategy execution 
framework can be used again to make the distinction between the roles of leaders and managers in 
resource allocation. Leaders play a more strategic role in resource allocation - they have a strategic view 
and focus on the first three domains of the strategy execution framework in terms of resour ce allocation, 
namely the nature, vision and engagement of the organisation. Managers, on the other hand, have a 
more operational view and focus on the engagement, synthesis and transition domains of the strategy 
execution framework. In this section, we fo cus on the role of managers and more specifically operational 
management and the management of strategic initiatives and the process of making strategy part of 
everyone's job.  
To make strategy part of everyone's job requires a process that consists of a number of steps as indicated 
in figure 4.2.

Activity  
Suppose you are a marketing manager of a large retailer with a footprint in South Africa and 
other African countries. The company aims to  revamp its stores and service, improve products 
and the assortment thereof, leverage on its loyalty programme, grow its existing format 
footprint and expand into the rest of Africa. Explain how you, as the marketing manager, will 
develop a road map that a ligns the day -to-day activities of the individuals in the marketing 
department with the strategic direction of the organisation.  
 
Feed back  
To ensure that the day -to-day activities of each individual in the marketing department (and 
every other department in the organisation) are aligned with the strategic direction of the 
organisation, you need to follow certain guidelines:  
46 MNG3702/1  
• Translate goals into potential strategic initiatives. Firstly, you need to decide what the few 
essential goals are that the marketing department needs to meet to achieve the 
organisational strategies. Secondly, you need to deci de how to define success in the 
refinement of your goals - these are the measures of your success. Then, you need to decide 
how far and how fast you need to go in attaining your goals - these are improvement 
targets that need to adhere to dates as well as specific measureable outputs. Lastly, you 
need to decide what the few critical things are that you need to do to realise your targets.  
• Prioritise strategic initiatives. Strategic initiatives then need to be placed in order of priority 
and aligned with the strategic direction of the organisation.  
• Define and approve strategic initiatives. Once placed in order of priority, strategic initiatives 
should be defined clearly and approved.  
• Align individual behaviour. Lastly, individual behaviour should be aligned wi th the approved 
strategic initiatives.  
• Report on strategic initiatives and take corrective actions where required.  
4.4 CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT FOR EFFECTIVE RESOURCE 
ALLOCATION  
While strategy implementation will always be a complex process fraught with difficulties, there are some 
steps that an organisation can take to improve strategy implementation. Some initiatives may involve 
management development, a participative process for strategy development and developing a clear 
process for resource allocatio n. 
Continuous Assessment  
Go to the online Assessment tool on myUnisa, and complete the questions based on  Resource 
allocation for strategy implementation, before you continue with lesson 5.  
4.5 CONCLUSION  
The allocation of resources in a responsible manner is vital for the success of any organisation. Resource 
allocation is a complex and unpredictable process, especially in a country with limited resources, high 
rates of poverty and unemployment, and low levels of skilled labour. In this lesson, we considered t he 
requirements for successful resource allocation in organisations.  
If we look at the big picture of strategic management and the contemporary strategic management 
framework that we provided you with in lesson 1, we have now concluded our discussion of st rategy 
formation, change management, the learning organisation and resource allocation.

and the importance of the alignment between culture and strategy.  
48 Lesson 5  
ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE AND STRATEGY  
Lesson 5 is based on chapter 11 of the prescribed book. You should study  
this chapter in its entirety  to provide you with the detailed theory in terms of  
organisational culture and strategy.  
In lesson 4, we explained resource allocation in the context of strategy implementation. We  
indicated that the allocation of organisational resources is a complex and  unpredictable  
process that occurs in a complex and dynamic environment. In this lesson, our focus turns  
to one of the elements of organisational architecture, namely organisational culture and  
the important role that it plays in strategy implementation.  
Learning Outcomes  
After you have completed this lesson, you should be able to  
• define organisational culture  
• use the cultural web to assess an organisation's culture  
• identify the cornerstones of a solid organisational culture in an organisation  
• identify the warning signs of a toxic organisational culture in an organisation  
• use various indicators to determine the health of an organisation's culture  
• discuss key considerations in organisational culture and strategy  
5.1 ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE  
Organisational culture i s defined as the accumulated shared learning of a group as it solves its problems 
of external adaption and internal integration, which has worked well enough to be considered valid and, 
therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive,  think, feel and behave in relation 
to those problems. An organisation's culture is not something that will develop overnight - culture 
evolves over time and it is the end result of accumulated and shared organisational learning (which we 
discussed in less on 3).  
A Key Concepts  
Organisational culture is the accumulated shared learning of a group as it solves its  
problems of external adaption and internal integration; which has worked well enough  
to be considered valid and, therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct way  
to perceive, think, feel and behave in relation to those problems.  
 
 
49  
5.2 THE LAYERS OF ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE  
Edward Hall developed the iceberg analogy of organisational culture in 1976. He reasoned that if culture 
is an iceberg, there are some aspects which are visible and can be seen (above the water), and a larger 
aspect which is hidden beneath the surface (below the water) (Hall 1976). The tip of the iceberg typically 
consists of tangible manifestations that you can se e and feel. The layers below the water, however, 
become more intangible and less visible. These aspects include espoused values and norms and taken -
for-granted assumptions. The various layers are briefly explained below:  
• Visible artefacts. Artefacts are everywhere and are visible throughout the organisation. Artefacts have 
three important dimensions, namely instrumentality, aesthetics and symbolism.  
• Espoused values and norms. This refers to a collection of values and norms shared by people and 
groups who work together. This also includes beliefs and behaviours in the organisation.  
• Taken -for-granted assumptions. Organisational artefacts, values and norms give rise to assumptions 
that determine how employees operates within an organisation. When a solution t o a problem 
works repeatedly, it gets taken for granted.  
Layers of organisational culture:  
• visible artefacts  
• espoused values and norms  
• taken -for-granted assumptions  
Activity  
Study the four layers of organisational culture that we have discussed in this section.  
Identify elements of these layers in the following information pertaining to Ernest &  
Young (EY).  
EY is a multinational professional services organisation with headquarters in London, England. 
EY is one of the largest professional services and acc ounting organisations in the world. It 
aspires to have a leading people culture everywhere in the world. It further aims to create a 
culture that attracts and retains outstanding people.  
Globalisation and underlying demographic trends mean that competition  to employ 
outstanding people is evolving rapidly. Successful companies are adapting to this by building 
internationally experienced leadership and equipping their people with the skills to lead in 
the diverse 21st -century workforce.  
EY is already proud of  its people culture, and is committed to doing even more. Its people tell 
it that the culture of global teaming focuses on  building a better working worl d; it aspires to 
have a leading people culture everywhere in the world. Creating a culture that attracts and 
retains outstanding people and helps them thrive leads to better service for its clients.  
EY is investing in three key elements of its culture t hat enhance what is important to its clients 
and its people:  
 
50 MNG3702/1  
• Inclusiveness. Recruiting outstanding people is just the start. Inclusiveness means making 
sure all its people's voices are heard and valued. This not only helps attract and retain the 
best people, but it also helps get better answers for its clients and its organisation.  
• Development. Its appr oach to development involves offering the learning, experi ences 
and coaching all its people need to enrich their careers and deliver the best results for 
clients, as well as offering additional programmes for current and future leaders of its 
organisation . 
• Engagement. EY wants all its people to feel enthused by their work and their col leagues 
and to be comfortable in an organisation that gives them the flexibility to achieve their 
professional and personal aspirations. It engages its people in countless w ays, from 
selecting the right people to lead major change, to taking an interest in its people as 
individuals, to being sure to say thank you for a job well done.  
Who EY is:  
People who demonstrate integrity, respect and teaming.  
People with energy, enthusiasm and the courage to lead.  
People who build relationships based on doing the right thing.  
Its values define who it is. Its values are the fundamental beliefs of its global organisation. Its 
values guide its actions and behaviour. They influence th e way that its people work with each 
other - and the way that it serves its clients and engages with its communities.  
Every day, each one of its people makes choices and decisions that directly affect the way 
they experience each other and the way their cl ients and wider communities experience 
them. Their values give them confidence that they are using the same principles to help them 
make these decisions throughout their global organisation.  
Its global awards programme, Better begins with you, enables its people to recognise and 
celebrate individuals and teams within the organisation who consistently live their values and 
bring their purpose of building a better working world to life through their everyday 
behaviour, which in turn makes an impact on its cli ents, people and communities.  
This programme is an important way in which it is building a shared culture, founded on its 
strong commitment to its values.

Beliefs. The company believes that success is based on people, they treat one another with 
respect and dignity and expect everyone to promote a sense of personal responsibility.  
Behaviours. The company recruits competent and motivated people and respects their values, 
provides equal opportunities for their development and advancement, protects their privacy and 
does not tolerate any form  of harassment or discrimination.  
Taken -for-granted assumptions. EYis a global leader in its industry.  
In the next section, we will explore the culture web as a tool to assess the culture of an organisation. 
However, before we turn our focus to the assessm ent of an organisation's culture, have a look at the 
following activity for discussion on myUnisa.  
Questions for discussion on myUnisa Discussion Forums  
• Within one organisation, do you think that you can identify one prevailing organisational culture? 
Substantiate your answer.  
• Do you think that organisational culture is static or does it evolve over time? Substantiate your 
answer.  
• In a diverse workforce, who do you think will play a decisive role in determining the organi sational 
culture?  
5.3 CULTURAL ASSE SSMENT  
A well -accepted approach to analyse or access an organisation's culture is the cultural  
web. The cultural web shows the behavioural, physical and symbolic manifestations of  
a culture that inform and are informed by taken -for-granted assumptions, or paradigm,  
of an organisation.  
The cultural web shows the behavioural, physical and symbolic manifestations of a culture that inform 
and are informed by taken -for-granted assumptions, or paradigm, of an organisation.  
The cultural web consists of the following elements:  
•  Paradigm. Forms the core of the cultural web as it represents all the assumptions taken for granted 
in the organisation.  
•  Routines. The ways things are done on a day -to-day basis within an organisation.  
•  Stories. Centre on important ev ents and personalities.  
•  Symbols. Refer to objects, metaphors, events, acts or people that convey a meaning over and 
above their functional purpose.  
• Power. The ability of individuals or groups to persuade, induce or coerce others into following 
certain courses of action.  
• Structure. The formal configuration between individuals and groups regarding the allocation of 
tasks, responsibilities and the authority within an organisation.  
52 MNG3702/1  
• Control systems. The formal and informal ways  of monitoring and supporting  
people within an organisation.  
The question that we can now ask ourselves is the following - "how do we make sure that  
an organisation's culture is aligned with its vision, strategic direction, goals and strategy?"  
Remember th at during the strategy formation process, the organisation's vision, direction,  
goals and strategy were determined. During strategy implementation, we need to ensure  
that there is proper alignment between all these processes - a principle that has been  
highlighted throughout this module. The next section addresses this issue, namely how  
to instil an organisational culture that supports good strategy implementation. In other  
words, an organisational structure aligned with the vision, goals and strategy of th e 
organisation.  
5.4 INSTILLING AN ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE THAT  
SUPPORTS GOOD STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION  
A culture that supports good strategy implementation is a culture that  
• recognises and embraces shared values, attitudes, standards and beliefs that  
characterise  the goals of the organisation  
• recognises that it is people who make a business successful and not only its business  
operations  
• weaves its values into the DNA of its teams and informs the recruitment of new  
employees  
Business managers should pay attention to the cornerstones of a solid business culture.  
These are the following:  
• transparency  
• time to connect  
• empowerment and a sense of freedom  
• physical space  
• talking to customers and employees  
• organisational design  
Warning signs of a toxic organisational cultur e are the following:  
• Performance measures are becoming the primary business purpose.  
• Unethical business practices occur.  
•  Leaders fail to uphold organisational values.  
•  Performance and talent systems that reinforce desired behaviours are misaligned.  
Activity  
Consider the organisation that you are working for. Would your regard this organisation as  
• an organisation with a culture that supports good strategy implementation  
• or an organisation with a toxic organisational culture?  
 
53 Substantiate your answer.  
Feedback  
For an organisation to be regarded as an organisation with a culture that supports good strategy 
implementation, it should recognise and embrace shared values, attitudes, standards and beliefs 
that characterise the goals of the organisation. There should also be evidence that the 
organisation recognises that it is people who mak e it a successful business and not only its 
business operations. Its values should be weaved into the DNA of its teams and inform the 
recruitment of all new employees. The organisation should be transparent when conducting its 
business, it should recognise  work -life integration and the significance to allow employees a 
balanced lifestyle, and employees should be empowered and given a sense of freedom, attention 
should be given to their physical space and the design of offices. Lastly, time should be spent 
talking to customers and employees.  
Signs of a toxic organisational culture are performance measures that are becoming the primary 
business purpose, unethical business practices that occur, leaders failing to uphold organisational 
values, and performance and talent systems that reinforce desired behaviours are misaligned. 
There may be other signs as well.  
Various indicators can be used to address the health of an organisation's culture. These are addressed in 
the next section.  
5.5 CULTURE INDICATORS  
The follow ing indicators should be tracked over time and alarm mechanisms should be put in place to 
identify unacceptable variances to determine the health or a change in the health of an organisation's 
culture:  
• performance statistics  
• human -resource -related statistics  
• feedback from other internal and external parties  
• customer surveys  
• a whistle -blower programme  
In the last section in this lesson, we focus on three key considerations in terms of organisational culture 
and strategy.  
54  
MNG3702/1  
5.6 KEY CONSIDERATIONS IN ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE AND 
STRATEGY  
The following are the three key considerations in terms of organisational culture and  
strategy:  
• Matching the organisational culture with the requirements of the strategy execution effort. This 
action can focus the attention of employees on what is most important to successfully implement 
the strategy.  
• Using strong group norms to create culture -induced peer pressure which can shape employee 
behaviour to do things in a manner that aids the ca use of good strategy implementation.  
• Accepting that an organisational culture that is consistent with the requirements for good strategy 
execution can energise employees, deepen their commitment and enhance worker productivity  
 Continuous Assessment  
Go to the online Assessment tool on myUnisa, and complete the questions based on 
Organisational culture and stra tegy, before you continue with lesson 6.  
5.7 CONCLUSION  
Every individual has his or her own personality, shaping his or her behaviour, way of living, sensing and 
sense making of the world. In the same way, every organisation has a "personality" which explains the 
taken -for-granted assumptions (or paradigm) that shape the acting, sensing and sense making done by 
organisational members within the internal environmental context. Each organisation builds its own culture 
by adopting unique values, beliefs, principle s and behavioural norms. This lesson highlighted the 
importance of the alignment between organisational culture and strategy and provided guidelines for 
instilling a culture that supports good strategy implementation. In lesson 6, our focus shifts to respo nsible 
strategic leadership.  
55 Lesson 6  
RESPONSIBLE STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP  
Lesson 6 is based on chapter 12 of the prescribed book. You should study this chapter in its entirety to 
provide you with the detailed theory in terms responsible strategic leadership.  
In lesson 5, organisational culture as one of the components of organisational architecture was discussed. 
In this lesson, we continue our discussion of the components of organisational architecture and the 
important role that they pl ay in strategy implementation and their contribution to a cohesive strategy, 
and we focus on responsible strategic leadership.  
Learning Outcomes  
After you have completed this lesson, you should be able to  
• define leadership and differentiate between leadership and management in an 
organisation  
• define strategic leadership and explain the role of strategic leaders in strategy 
implementation  
• define responsible strategic leadership  
• critically evaluate an organisation's fulfilment of its leadership respons ibilities with 
respect to key stakeholders  
• explain the roles that leaders need to play when practising responsible strategic 
leadership and assess a leader's ability to play these roles in an organisation  
• define corporate sustainability  
• define sustainable development and explain the three core elements thereof  
• explain the six levels of commitment that an organisation can take, or move through, as 
it responds to the challenges of responsibility and sustainability  
• assess the level of commitment that an organisation is taking, or is moving through, in 
its response to the challenges of responsibility and sustainability  
6.1 LEADERSHIP VERSUS MANAGEMENT  
We find leaders in all spheres of life - the average five year old will have some concept of what it is. As 
children in school we have all had the experience of lining up for class, in the playground or on a school 
trip, and so recognise "the leader" as "the one in front". Our concept of leadership develops along with 
our own development and experience of the worl d: we begin by following the guidance of our parents, 
taking the lead from them in many important aspects of our lives. As we move out into the world, we 
become subject to the attempts of others - politicians, social and religious leaders, and peers - to turn us 
into followers, or perhaps we become leaders ourselves. The media bombards  
 
56  
MNG3702/1  
us with images of leadership, from the public speech -making of our politicians, to the high -profile 
activities of the CEOs of our favourite brand name companies. We are witness, too, to quieter leadership - 
leaders in schools working to deliver high -quality education to our  children, or community activists 
fighting for better healthcare, less corruption or the rights of the disadvantaged.  
Leadership is a topic that has fascinated many researchers for a long time. Consequently, various 
definitions of leadership are found in l iterature. For our purposes, we will define leadership as a process 
by which an individual influences his or her follower or followers to achieve a common goal. In this 
definition, we find a wide range of implications of what makes a person a leader, the n ature of leadership, 
and also the difference between leadership and management:  
• Firstly, to be a leader, there needs to be followers. Without followers, the term "leader" is just an 
empty title. Being a leader does not depend on a formal appointment in a f ormal hierarchy or 
structure. This characteristic of a leader brings us to the first difference between a leader and a 
manager. A manager is someone appointed in a formal position in the organisational structure or 
hierarchy - a leader does not have to be appointed in a formal position of authority to be regarded 
as a leader. Also, being a leader does not mean that one needs to have subordinates like a manager. 
A leader needs followers that follow him or her because of free will. Subordinates do not have a 
choice to follow their managers.  
• The second implication of this definition of leadership, is that a leader is out front, setting the pace, 
determining the standard and the direction of movement.  
• Thirdly, the leader strives to build authentic relationships between people.  
• Fourthly, the definition also implies that a leader is not necessarily an individual - it 
can be a group, a corporate body, an industry or even a country.  
• Lastly, the definition implies that the leader and the followers have a common goal.  
 Key Concepts  
Leadership is a process by which an individual influences his or her follower or followers to 
achieve a common goal.  
Management and leadership share many similar characteristics and outcomes. Yet, the two terms also 
differ in many ways.  
Managers  
• cope with complexity in the organisations that employ them  
• plan and draw up budgets  
• organise and staff the organisation  
• control  and solve problems  
• maintain business processes and procedures  
• accept the status quo in the organisation  
57 • minimise risk  
• focus on organisational goals and objectives  
Leaders, on the other hand,  
• cope with change  
• set a directive  
• align people with the organisation's vision and strategic direction  
• motivate and inspire people (their followers)  
•  develop new direction in the organisation  
•  challenge the status quo and take calculated risks  
• focus on a clear vision for the organisation  
In essen ce, leadership is strategic, focused on the vision of the organisation and involves a  
strong element of building trust and emotional engagement with followers. Management,  
on the other hand, is operational, focused on goal achievement, and more directive o f 
those that are managed. Organisations need both leaders and managers to be successful.  
In the next section, we will have a look at the role of strategic leadership in strategy  
implementation.  
Activity  
Leaders come in all types, shapes and sizes. Looking through history there appears to  
be common themes. These gifted people have to be able to think clearly and wisely, make  
things happen, communicate well and engage other people to follow their lead. Leaders  
have the gift to inspire people to perform beyond  what they previously considered to be  
their best and achieve outstanding results. In your opinion, who exemplified this type of  
leadership in the past? Provide reasons for your answer.  
 
Feedback  
The individuals that you identify as an exemplification of this type of leadership can come from 
various countries and from various industries, politics, and academia or even from religious 
sources. For example, President Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Henry Ford, Anton 
Rupert, President Cyril Ramaphosa, President Barack Obama, Whitey Basson, Thuli Madonsela, 
to mention only a few.  
58 MNG3702/1  
6.2 THE ROLE OF STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP IN STRATEGY 
IMPLEMENTATION  
Before we investigate the role of strategic leadership in strategy implementation, it is important to 
understand what strategic leadership entails. Strategic leadership is a process by which a strategic leader 
influenc es a follower or followers to achieve the strategic vision of the organisation.  
Strategic leadership is a process by which a strategic leader influences a follower or followers to achieve 
the strategic vision of the organisation.  
Most successful strategic leaders perform two key roles in organisations namely:  
• Charismatic leadership role. This involves setting up and gaining support for a vision and direction 
for the organisation.  
• Architectural role. This concerns building an organisation and an appropriate organisational 
structure system, controlling and rewarding system.  
For a leader to be considered as operating on a strategic level, the following six requirements need to be 
met: 
•  The leader needs to have the ability to build knowledge of the environment i n which the 
organisation operates.  
• The leader needs to portray personal leadership.  
• The leader needs to have an understanding of the organisation and its processes.  
• The leader needs to have the ability to create shared understanding  and build learning  
and high-performance teams in the organisation.  
• The leader needs to feel comfortable with change and enjoy the paradoxes that change entails.  
• The leader needs to have a rooting in functional skills.  
Various researchers have different viewpoints in terms of the  essence of strategic leadership. Boal and 
Hooiberg (2001) see the essence of strategic leadership as being the creation and maintenance of 
absorptive capacity, adaptive capacity and managerial wisdom:  
• Absorptive capacity. In the context of strategic leade rship, absorptive ability refers to the ability of a 
leader to learn - to absorb and understand new developments, and to be able to see how they can 
be used in the organisation.  
• Adaptive capacity. This refers to the leader's ability to change in  response t o some  
change in the environment.  
•  Managerial wisdom. Managerial wisdom combines properties of understanding what is changing in 
the environment and the significance that it holds for the organisation.  
The term "responsible leadership" is becoming more and  more common across the global corporate 
community. In the following section, we address responsible strategic leadership. However, before you 
study the next section, do the following activity.  
59  Activity  
Increasingly, society expects businesses to be able to play a part in solving big global  
issues. In South Africa, water scarcity is an important issue, whereas climate change,  
inequality and poverty are issues that countries around the globe are confronted with.  
Questions:  
(1) What do you think is the main purpose of a business?  
(2) Is it the responsibility of private sector companies to reduce climate change, alleviate 
poverty and offer solutions to inequalities?  
(3) How would you make the case to shareholders that your business should be taking 
responsibility in these areas?  
Feedback  
(1) Traditionally, it was said that businesses exist to make a profit, and produce products and  
services that meet the needs of customers. We have come a long way since this nar row view 
of the purpose of a business. Businesses rely on the environment in which they operate, to 
supply the resources/inputs needed to transform these into need -satisfyin g products and/or 
services. The important aspect is that resources are scarce and limited, whereas people have 
unlimited needs and wants for the products and services which businesses provide. 
Businesses are responsible for transforming resources into prod ucts and/or services, and 
they need to do this is a responsible manner. The fact is - businesses take what they need 
from the environment, but they also need to "give back" to the en vironment - which leads 
to the current view of the purpose of businesses,  namely that they have to satisfy the needs 
of all their stakeholders (not only shareholders).  
(2) The private sector can (and should) play a role in addressing these issues. We will discuss 
the reasoning behind this statement in more detail later on in this l esson.  
(3) Businesses can no longer afford to only focus on profitability and the return on investment 
for shareholders/owners. Businesses, together with government, the community and also 
the individual, face real challenges in terms of climate change, povert y and inequality, and 
so on. Therefore they also need to be part of the solution to these problems.  
6.3 RESPONSIBLE STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP  
In our discussion of strategic leadership thus far, our focus was on the relationships between strategic 
leaders and their followers in the organisation, where followers are mostly the subordinates in the 
organisation. Responsible strategic leadership, however, goes beyond this notion, and takes place in 
interaction with a multitude of followers as stakeholders inside and outs ide the organisation. Responsible 
strategic leaders deliver value for all stakeholders by delivering on the "triple bottom -line" - an 
accounting  
60 MNG3702/1  
framework with three parts - social, environmental and financial dimensions. Such a view on the 
responsibility of strategic leaders, which is often referred to as "stakeholder theory", starts with the 
assumption that values are necessary and explicitly a part of doing business. In this module, we define 
responsible strategic leader ship as the art of building and sustaining morally sound relationships with all 
relevant stakeholders of an organisation.  
Responsible strategic leadership is the art of building and sustaining morally sound relationships with 
all relevant stakeholders of a n organisation.  
Responsible strategic leaders play a vital role in establishing the organisational values, and in ensuring 
that the organisation meets its responsibilities with respect to its key stakeholders, namely employees, 
clients and customers, busin ess partners, the social environment, the natural environment, shareholders 
and government. Each of these key stakeholders will be briefly explained below:  
•  Employees. Responsible strategic leaders mobilise people and lead teams across business, countries 
and cultures to achieve performance objectives that are derived from the strategic objectives of the 
organisation. In doing so, they coach and mentor employees to achieve objectives in an ethical 
manner. They ensure the implementation of employment regulat ions and standards; that working 
conditions are humane, save, healthy and non -discriminatory; and that the needs of employees for 
recreation, work -life balance and meaningful work are addressed.  
• Clients and customers. Responsible strategic leaders ensure that the products and services meet the 
needs of their customers that they are safe and that real and potential risks are openly and 
transparently communicated.  
•  Business partners. In their day -to-day activities, strategic leaders are in contact with vario us business 
partners. A business partner is any individual or organisation who has some degree of involvement 
with the organisation's (or leader's) business dealings, such as the organisation's suppliers. 
Responsible strategic leaders ensure that their bus iness partners adhere to ethical, environmental 
and labour standards. Moreover, responsible strategic leaders ensure that their business partners are 
treated fairly and ethically.  
• Social environment. Responsible leaders foster contributions to society. Thi s can be in the form of 
passive actions (e.g. charity and corporate donations), and active engagement for the wellbeing of 
communities. Responsible leaders should also endeavour to train and develop their staff in their 
understanding of the responsibilitie s of their organisations in society.  
• Natural environment. Responsible strategic leaders are sensitive to the world in which they operate 
and assess the impact their organisation's decision and actions will have in the natural environment. 
They ensure that production processes are environmentally friendly, they use "green" technology 
wherever it is possible, they recycle material and save energy.  
•  Shareholders. Since shareholders own shares in a company, responsible strategic leaders protect the 
investment c apital of their shareholders and ensure an adequate return on their investment. They 
respect the rights of shareholders, provide them  
61 with timely information on the performance of the company. Furthermore, they show due diligence 
with respect to their own and others' insider knowledge. They prevent any moral wrong -doing and 
act responsibly with regard to their own compensation packages.  
• Government. The responsible strategic leader will obey laws as determined by government, pay 
taxes, provide inputs to government in terms of technical economic financial or political importance 
for framing appropriate policies, take up governmental projects and contracts, offer its leaders to 
assist government and work on different governmental committee s. Responsible strategic leaders 
can also participate in politics.  
At this point, we can ask ourselves the question "How do we practice responsible strategic  
leadership?" The next section addresses this question.  
6.4 PRACTISING RESPONSIBLE STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP  
When practising responsible strategic leadership, leaders need to play the following roles:  
• The responsible leader as steward. Contemporary organisations need to perform and survive in a 
more complex and fast -changing environment than ever, and need the stewardship of responsible 
leaders to look after them. These leaders need to have a global perspective on managerial 
challenges, a social and moral radar to assess the social, ecological and cultural environment to steer 
the organisation through challengin g waters. They also need to cope with conflicting stakeholder 
expectations and ethical dilemmas.  
• The responsible leader as citizen. Organisations are expected to use the minimum inputs to create 
maximum outputs, to be effective and efficient and perform fi nancially well. At the same time, 
organisations are expected to contribute to a thriving community and a good society. Therefore, 
organisations need leaders as active citizens that recognise that both these goals are connected to 
each other.  
• The responsibl e leader as visionary. Leaders play an indispensable role in formulating the vision, or 
desired future, of their organisations. There is nothing as powerful as a shared vision that appeals to 
followers and all stakeholders in the success of an organisation . A responsible leader will ensure a 
responsible vision and build on an ethically sound notion of balanced values that will lead to a 
sustainable business, ensuring financial success and the wellbeing of nature and society.  
• The responsible leader as servan t. A servant leader is one that shares their power with their 
followers, puts the needs of others first and helps followers to develop and perform as highly as 
possible. Servant leadership has profound implications for the responsible leader. A responsible  
leader should serve others, which requires attentiveness, humility and modesty on the one hand, 
and on the other, it requires a willingness and desire to support others and to care for their interests 
and their needs.  
• The responsible leader as coach. In t imes of ongoing change, the responsible leader needs to 
facilitate the development of their followers, enable them to learn and support them in achieving 
their objectives. The responsible leader needs to integrate and motivate followers from various 
backgr ounds to work together and to share and realise a common vision.  
62 MNG3702/1  
• The responsible leader as architect. The responsible leader needs to plan, design and construct 
organisational structures that support the ethical and effective  achievement and monitoring of the 
triple -bottom -line and the realisation of the organisation's shared vision.  
•  The responsible leader as storyteller and meaning enabler. An effective tool to support the creation 
of meaning and sense making in organisation s, is storytelling. Leaders can use storytelling widely to 
spread the organisation's vision of a socially, culturally and environmentally friendly business that 
aims to make a difference in the world.  
• The responsible leader as change agent. Leaders have th e enormous responsibility to act as change 
agents, by initiating and supporting change in their organisations towards a value -conscious and 
sustainable business in a stakeholder society.  
Being a responsible strategic leader, also means ensuring the sustain ability and sustainable development. 
These two concepts will be addressed in the next section.  
6.5 SUSTAINABILITY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT  
Sustainability is a broad discipline that gives us insights into most aspects of the human world from 
business, to technology to the environment and the social sciences. Environmental sustainability can be 
described as the avoidance of the depletion of natural resources in order to maintain an ecological 
balance. In a business context, corporate or organisational susta inability is the ability of an organisation to 
continue to do business over the long term - and possibly indefinitely. But, most importantly, sustainable 
business is tied up with the impact that the business has on the environmental resources of the world that 
it consumes in the process. Sustainability suggests that business leaders need to critically consider how 
their organisations can reduce and minimise their impact on the natural resources they utilise. By doing 
this well, business leaders can help to ensure that their businesses will be around in the future, and that 
future generations will continue to have the ability to support themselves and to flourish, thanks to the 
impact of current business strategies and practices.  
Corporate sustainability is the ability of an organisation to continue to do business over the long 
term - and possibly indefinitely.  
When businesses reduce and minimise their impact on the natural resources that they utilise, are 
sustainable and future generations have the ability to  support themselves and to flourish, it will all 
contribute to sustainable development - economic development that is conducted without depletion of 
natural resources.  
Sustainable development is economic development that is conducted without depletion of n atural 
resources.  
Sustainable development has three core elements, namely society, the environment and the economy 
(also known as people, planet and profit or the three P's) which are all  
63 interconnected . Organisations respond to the challenges of responsibility and sustainability  
either by taking a position on, or by moving through, six levels or phases of commitment  
(Dunphy, Griffiths & Benn 2003):  
• Phase 1: Rejection. A focus on exploiting all resources (human and ecological) for  
the sake of maximising profit. Strategic leaders here would not accept responsibility  
or listen to sustainability arguments, and would actively work against possible  
regulation or activism.  
• Phase 2: Non -responsiveness. Characterised by a lack of awareness or ignorance  
of sustainable or social issues, rather than active opposition to these issues.  
• Phase 3: Compliance. Complying with laws and regulations to avoid risk, or complying  
with self -regulatory measures to avoid legislation which may limit the activities  of 
the organisation.  
•  Phase 4: Efficiency. Sustainability is seen as a cost reduction and efficiency strategy.  
Principles of sustainability are incorporated into everyday business practice.  
• Phase 5: Strategic pro -activity. Sustainability is viewed as potentially  
giving competitive advantage as well as ensuring cost efficiencies. Leaders here see  
sustainability as a strategic route to taking a position of leadership in an industry,  
and thus maximising returns.  
• Phase 6: The sustaining organisation. One t hat is committed to the principles  
of social and ecological sustainability, that is maintaining returns, but is focused on  
meeting the needs of the present without compromising the opportunities of future  
generations.  
The level that an organisation achieve s in its commitment to sustainability reflects the  
manner in which it treats the human and ecological resources it utilises in the process of  
doing business. An organisation does not necessarily progress through this continuum  
in a linear way, but may jump  from one phase to another, and regress depending on  
internal and external pressures. Obviously, the ideal for any organisation is to stay at  
phase 6, and to remain committed to the principles of social and ecological sustainability,  
to maintain financial performance while staying focused on meeting the needs of the  
present without compromising the opportunities of future generations.

Feedback  
(1) Woolworths is an excellent example of a company which is committed to sustainabil ity. 
Through the "Good Business Journey", Woolworths is committed to caring for the 
environment, people and communities. The "Good Business Journey"has the following five 
goals for 2020:  
• contribute R3.5 billion to communities  
• save 500 billion litres of water  
•  halve the company's energy impact  
• responsibly source all key commodities  
•  have at least one sustainable attribute for all directly sourced products  
(2) Woolworths can be placed at phase 6 on the ladder, namely the sustaining corporation - 
one that is committed to the principles of social and ecological sustainability, that 
maintains retu rns but is focused on meeting the needs of the present without compro mising 
the opportunities of future generations.  
Being a responsible strategic leader means accepting that you have obligations to the health of the 
business, to your workers, customers, the community and nature. Furthermore, a responsible strategic 
leader also recognises the challenges in terms of sustainability and sustainable development.

6.6 CONCLUSION  
In this lesson, we addressed one of the crucial elements of organisational architecture, namely responsible 
strategic leadership. On a daily basis, the media bombards us with examples of misconduct of leaders - 
leaders in business, politics, churches, schools - in all spheres of life. Fortunately, we also hear success 
stories that are shared, the new school principal who arrives with a parachute on the first school day of 
the new year, praying for the Grade 12s of the year, the politician who uses her own money to buy school 
books for underprivileged primary school children or the business executive who flies economy class even 
though she is entitled to fly business class o n business trips. In this lesson, we focused on the 
responsibilities of strategic leaders - not only in terms of the bottom line of their businesses, but also in 
terms of their responsibility towards all other stakeholders as well. The next lesson focuses on the last 
element of organisational architecture, namely structure and strategy.  
65 Lesson 7  
ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND STRATEGY  
Lesson 7 is based on chapter 13 of the prescribed book. You should study  
this chapter in its entirety to provide you with the detailed theory in terms of  
organisational structure and strategy.  
In lesson 6, responsible leadership was highlighted as one of the important elements of  
organisational architecture. In this lesson, we focus on another element of orga nisational  
architecture, namely organisational structure.  
Learning Outcomes  
After you have completed this lesson, you should be able to  
• define organisational structure  
• explain  the role of top management in organisational design  
• explain  the various organisational structure alternatives with  reference to the ad  
vantages and disadvantages of each alternative  
• explain  the various applications of organisational structure  
• identify  the symptoms of structural deficiency in an organisation  
7.1 ORGANISATIONAL STR UCTURE AND THE ROLE OF TOP  
MANAGEMENT IN ORGANISATIONAL DESIGN  
Organisations exist to achieve their strategic goals. These goals can be broken down into goals for 
various business units. Then it can be further broken down into goals for the functional 
departments/areas/units of the organisation. Within each department , distinctions can be found between 
the jobs that people perform. Departments are linked to form the organisational structure of an 
organisation. The organisation's structure gives it the form to fulfil its function in the environment. The 
term organisatio nal structure  refers to the formal configuration between individuals and groups regarding 
the allocation of tasks, responsibilities and the authority within an organisation.  
mrnm  Key Concepts  
The term organisational structure refers to the formal configuration between individu - 
als and groups regarding the allocation of tasks, responsibilities and the authority within  
an organisation.  
  
 
66  
MNG3702/1  
The role of top management in organisation design can be summarised as follows:  
• Firstly, top  management is responsible for analysing the external and internal environment.  
• Secondly, top management determines the strategic direction of the organisation.  
• Thirdly, based on the analysis of the internal and external environment and the desired strateg ic 
direction of the organisation, top management is responsible for creating the organisational 
structure  
• Lastly, top management also needs to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of the 
organisational efforts in terms of the realisation of its goals.  
One should treat with caution the tendency to represent the design of an organisation as a highly 
rational process which proceeds smoothly through a series of steps such as those indicated above. In 
practice, the design of an organisational structur e is a messy, political process in which established 
routines and stakes are challenged and often defended. Uneasy compromises are often found. Also, 
there may be considerable discrepancies between how the design of an organisation is presented by its 
top management, for example as a neat organisational chart, and how organisations operate on a day -
to-day basis.  
Questions for discussion on the myUnisa Discussion Forums  
"The organisational chart is the (usually top -down) visual representation of the organisa tional  
structure, showing what positions exist, how they are grouped and who reports to whom".  
• Do you agree with the statement that "an organisational chart indicates the structure of control but 
its enactment and realisation depends on the employees who provide the behaviour"? Substantiate 
your answer.  
• Do you think that organisational structures are politically imposed? Substantiate your answer.  
7.2 ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE ALTERNATIVES  
Organisational structures evolve and change over time - they are not stat ic. A number of basic structural 
types can be adapted by an organisation in order to satisfy its particular needs. The following basic 
structural forms are commonly found in organisations:  
• entrepreneurial structure  
• functional structure  
• divisional structure  
• holding company structure  
•  matrix structure  
•  global structure  
• network structure  
• new venture units  
• virtual network structure  
• horizontal structure  
• hybrid structures

7.3 APPLICATIONS OF ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE  
Each of the various organisational structure alternatives highlighted in the previous section, is applied in 
different situations and is intended to address different organisational demands. Each type of structure 
can be viewed as a tool that can make an organisation more or less effective, depending on the 
exigencies of the situation and the capaci ty of the structure to respond effectively to the demands. Two 
aspects are important in this regard, namely structural alignment and symptoms of structural deficiency.  
Structural alignment. One of the most important roles of top management in the design of  an 
organisational structure is finding the right balance between vertical control and horizontal 
coordination, depending on the changing needs of the organisation. Vertical control is associated with 
goals of efficiency and stability. Horizontal coordinat ion is associated with learning, innovation and 
flexibility.  
68  
Symptoms of structural deficiency. Periodically, top management needs to evaluate organisational 
structure in order to determine whether it is still appropriate to a changi ng environment and its strategic 
direction. The following can be used as symptoms of structural deficiency: decision making is delayed or 
lacking in quality, the organisation does not respond quickly and innovatively to a changing environment 
and strategic  goals are not being met, employee performance declines and goals are not being met, and 
there are conflicting departmental goals.  
Questions for discussion on the myUnisa Discussion Forums  
In contemporary organisations, which of the following would you con sider more important in  
the context of organisational structure:  
• vertical control, associated with goals of efficiency and stability  
• or horizontal coordination, associated with learning, innovation and flexibility?  
Substantiate your answer.

7.4 CONCLUSION  
In this lesson, we focused on the importance of the alignment between organisational structure and 
strategy. Developing an organisational structure is a complex matter. In fact, there are very few 
organisations that would claim that they have an ideal structure. Structure is always a work in progress, 
and is, therefore, alwa ys evolving. The last lesson in this module, lesson 8, focuses on strategic control 
and risk management.  
69 Lesson 8  
STRATEGIC CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT  
Lesson 8 is based on chapter 14 of the prescribed book. You should study  
this chapter in its entirety to provide you with the detailed theory in terms of  
organisational structure and strategy.  
In the previous lessons, we covered strategy formation and implementation. In this lesson,  
we focus on the last phase of the strategic manage ment process, namely strategic control.  
As an integral part of strategic control, we also address risk management and corporate  
governance.  
Learning Outcomes  
After you have completed this lesson, you should be able to  
• define strategic control  
• explain the s teps in the strategic control process  
• critically evaluate the application of the strategic control process by an  organisation  
• explain the four types of strategic control  
• identify and critically evaluate the four types of strategic control in an  organisation  
• explain the use of the balanced scorecard as a strategic control tool

8.1 DEFINING STRATEGIC CONTROL  
Strategic control is  a process used by organisations to control the formation and implementation of their 
strategies. It is a specialised form of management control and it differs from other forms of management 
control. Strategic control focuses on the achievement of future g oals. It involves tracking a strategy as it 
is being implemented. It is also concerned with detecting problems or changes in the strategy and 
making the necessary adjustments in the strategy.  
 
70  
MNG3702/1  
 Key Concepts  
Strategic control is a process used by organisations to control the formation and imple -
mentation of its strategies.  
The strategic control process differs from any other control processes in the organisation. In the next 
section, we investigate the process involved in strategic control.  
8.2 THE STRATEGIC CONTROL PROCESS  
The strategic control process is depicted in figure 8.1:

ation Strategic

Figure 8.1 The strategic control process  
Strategic control enables corporate management to monitor strategic outcomes (or its corporat e, overall 
performance) against planned or intended strategic goals to ensure that corporate activities remain on 
track and correspond to the set course without major discrepancies, while adapting to the changing 
environmental conditions. Should there be d eviations between planned and actual strategic outcomes, 
corrective action should be taken, which means that strategies could be redefined and strategic goals and 
objectives could be changed. If there are no deviation between the planned and actual strateg ic 
outcomes, there is no need to change strategic goals and objectives and the organisation can continue 
with its present strategy or strategies.  
Various types of strategic control can be implemented. These are discussed in the next section.  
8.3 TYPES OF STRATEGIC CONTROL  
The four types of strategic control that organisations can use are premise control, strategic surveillance, 
special alert control and implementation control. Premise control, strategic surveillance and special alert 
control are mainly use d to review the content of a strategy. Each of these are briefly explained below:  
• Premise control. Every strategy is based on certain planning premises and predictions about 
environmental changes and conditions. Premise control is designed to check methodi cally and 
constantly whether these premises on which a strategy is grounded, are still valid. Should a planning 
premise be no longer valid, the strategy may have to change or needs to be adjusted to reflect a 
changing reality.  
71  
•  Strategic surveillance. This type of strategic control is designed to observe a wide range of events 
within and outside an organisation that are likely to affect the track of the organisation's current 
strategy. Various sources may be consulted, for examp le trade magazines, journals, conferences, 
conversations with experts, observations and the internet which may provide important information 
that may influence the chosen strategy of the organisation.  
• Special alert control. The management environment is of ten characterised by unforeseen events. 
Thus, the rigorous and rapid reassessment of the organisation's strategy because of the occurrence 
of an immediate, unforeseen event may be necessary.  
• Implementation control. This type of strategic control is exercis ed as various activities, initiatives and 
programmes occur over a period when a chosen strategy is implemented. In other words, the 
chosen strategy is first monitored and, secondly, various milestones are reviewed.  
Types of strategic control:  
• premise control  
• strategic surveillance  
• special alert control  
• implementation control  
The balanced scorecard (BSC) is a tool that we have discussed numerous times in Strategic Management. 
In chapter 3 of the prescribed book entitled "A process perspective of strateg ic management" (Venter & 
Botha 2019), it was explained as a tool to set strategic goals, metrics, targets and initiatives. In chapter 8 
(entitled "Strategy implementation as change management") the BSC was explained as a tool that enables 
organisations to clarify their vision and strategy, thus making it possible to translate it into action. In the 
next section, we argue that the BSC should also be used as a strategic control tool.  
8.4 THE BALANCED SCORECARD AS STRATEGIC CONTROL 
TOOL  
The BSC enables management to monitor and evaluate organisational performance from the following 
four different perspectives in order to see whether strategic goals are being achieved in a balanced way:  
• financial perspective: linked to the expectations and needs of the shareholders as well as the 
financial performance or stewardship of the organisation  
• internal business perspective: linked to satisfying customer needs and a consideration of how 
customers see the organisation  
• learning and growth perspective: linked to the employees (h uman capital) and the capacity to 
achieve its goals  
•  customer perspective: linked to quality and efficiency in all that the organisation does  
The ultimate goal of any organisation is long -term survival and growth, which is expressed as 
sustainability  (we c overed this in lesson 6). As such, decisions by the organisation's management impact 
sustainability directly. Examples of decisions impacting sustainability  
72 MNG3702/1  
range from the kind of strategy that the organisation should employ like mergers and/or acquisitions; to 
diversification and/or alliances; to the market(s) where the organisation should operate; to options to 
protect the organisation from currency fluctuations and/or market volatility; to setting performance 
targets to men tion a few. Moreover, decisions and ultimately the sustainability of the organisation are 
influenced by the strategic leadership of the organisation. Strategic leadership can be a person or small 
group of persons whose personality, position or reputation g ive them dominance, especially over the 
strategy development process. All of the above decisions point in some way or another to strategic risk 
management and the sustainability of the organisation. This alludes to the integrated and complex nature 
of stra tegic risk management, which is the focus of the next section.  
8.5 RISK AND STRATEGIC RISK  
The term risk has different meanings for different people in different contexts. In the context of strategic 
management, we can define a strategic risk as an uncertain e vent or set of events which, should it occur, 
will have an effect on the achievement of strategic objectives.  
A strategic risk is an uncertain event or set of events which, should it occur, will have an effect on the 
achievement of strategic objectives.  
There are numerous examples of strategic risks that can have an influence on the strategic objectives and 
performance of organisations. For example, competitors may make "moves" - they may introduce new 
products, enter new markets, use new technologies or use new marketing strategies. New regulations 
may have an impact on the organisation, forcing it to revisit or change its strategies. Various political 
events may also force an organisation to adapt or change it strategies. Social changes, changes in the 
tastes or buying patterns of customers and new technologies are all examples of risk factors having an 
impact on corporate performance and strategy.  
The question that we need to ask ourselves at this point is "how do we manage these risks?" In the next 
section, we answer this question.  
8.6 THE STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS  
The following figure depicts an integrated strategic risk management framework. According to this figure, 
the strategic risk management process involves the identification, analysis, evalu ation of risk and the 
response to risk. However, the strategic risk management process is encapsulated by responsible 
leadership and governance, technology, capabilities, systems and structures.

Capabilities  
Figure 8.2: An integrated strategic risk management framework  
• The internal environment  
An effective strategic risk management approach requires an appropriate organisational structure 
comprising responsible leadership and governance, systems, structure, technology, capabilities and 
culture. We have dealt with all these issues (except for corpor ate governance) in previous lessons as 
elements or components of organisational architecture. The last section of this lesson will focus on 
corporate governance.  
•  Risk management process  
The risk management process comprises the following steps:  
Step 1: Ri sk identification  
Corporate risks are identified in terms of the potential losses or gains (opportunities or threats). A focus 
on significant risk factors combined with insight about the corporate activities should provide an 
understanding of how different  events may affect the ability to achieve longer -term objectives in view of 
identified opportunities and threats. It is possible that the different organisational actors may view these 
events and their impact differently. Hence, it is imperative to develop  a shared understanding of major 
corporate risk exposures and the interrelatedness in a way that is adapted to the specific environmental  
74 MNG3702/1  
conditions. Adopting a common risk management framework can underpin a consistent exami nation of 
corporate exposures and allow for cross -functional comparisons when assessing the aggregate corporate 
exposures. Business disruptions can typically arise along the corporate value chain and particularly in the 
interfaces between different functio nal units within a larger operational system. These internal processing 
conditions can affect the generation of cash flows both in terms of operating expenses and sales revenue 
and may provide a good basis for understanding vulnerable business activities a nd identifying 
opportunities for improvement. The identification of corporate risks may be supported by a common 
classification scheme that makes it easier to compare and communicate information about insights in 
terms of major exposures.  
Step 2: Risk anal yses 
The adoption of structured measurement methodologies can support managers in their formal decisions 
about the severity of identified risks by establishing common risk parameters, enabling aggregation of 
exposure and setting targeted risk limits. This is a challenging task given that data may not be available or 
risk measures may rely on restrictive assumptions. In these exercises judgement should not be foregone 
in favour of numbers. The insights of experienced experts, in particular, should be sought in assumptions 
that go into models that are developed and outputs that are interpreted. Scenario analysis and computer 
simulations can be useful as these techniques raise awareness of different risk factors and their 
interactions based on objective measure s of uncertainty in the analysis.  
Step 3: Risk evaluation and responses  
After the risks have been identified and analysed they should be evaluated in terms of the likelihood that 
the event will occur and the potential economic impact needs to be established. This approach must be 
supported by objective assessment criteria. The likely outcome must be compared with corporate 
objectives. In so doing the organisation can determine which of the potential outcomes are mission 
critical and whether the ex cess exposure should be modified. This should assist the organisation to focus 
on the priority risks that need to be managed. Consequently, corporate management can decide to avoid, 
retain, reduce, transfer or exploit risks at the corporate level, rather t han to make these decisions on a 
narrow or standalone basis.  
• Risk avoidance refers to the decision not to become involved in, or action to withdraw from, a risk 
situation.  
• Risk transfer refers to sharing with another party the burden of loss or benefit of gain for a particular 
risk. Risk transfer can be carried out through insurance of other agreements.  
•  Risk acceptance refers to the decision to accept the risk.  
•  Risk exploitation refers to a situation where a particular event or risk has a positive consequence on 
the organisation and relevant stakeholders and should then be exploited.  
• Risk mitigation refers to the limitation of any negative consequence of a parti cular event.  
75 In conclusion, one must bear in mind that the integrated strategic risk management framework is 
designed as a control framework, which should comply with regulatory requirements. Although 
compliance is important, the integ rated risk management framework advocates that risk be dealt with in 
the context of the organisation's strategy to accomplish the organisation's strategic objectives, priority is 
given to controls. As indicated in the integrated strategic risk management f ramework, corporate 
governance is an essential component thereof. The last section in this lesson addresses corporate 
governance.  
8.7 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  
Major risk events have made news headlines in recent years, with a consequent increased focus on 
corporate and strategic risk. One can only think of the Steinhoff International scandal towards the end of 
2017, when the company's share price plummeted by 61 % in the first three hours of trading on the 
Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), making it biggest collapse in the history of the JSE. More than 13 
billion US dollars were wiped out, and its share prices also plummeted in Frankfurt where it is also listed. 
This followed the revelation that Steinhoff was being investigated by German regulators about 
'irregularities and non -disclosures relating to its acquisitions" (https://www.marxist.com/turmoil -in- 
steinhof -and-naspers -exposes -crisis -of-the-big-capitalists.htm ). The underlying causes of t hese events are 
frequently related to internal controls, including integrity and personal accountability of corporate 
executives.  
In a response to these risk events, worldwide new regulatory frameworks have appeared to scrutinise 
business practices intende d to strengthen internal controls (e.g. the King reports in South Africa, and 
Sarbanes Oxley in the USA). Hence a renewed focus was placed on risk management with routine systems 
errors, operational malfunctions, uncontrollable employees and personal accou ntability at the centre of 
attention. These compliance measures are not intended to serve as a mere checklist, containing ticks to 
show that executives are responsible and ethical, but to empower organisations to introduce formal 
practices of effective and  efficient internal controls and personal accountability that allow for greater 
scrutiny of internal processes and reporting systems. As such, organisations can pro -actively respond in 
innovative ways to changes in the dynamic environment in which they ope rate, to ensure their sustained 
long-term survival and growth.  
Corporate governance can be defined as a framework  of rules and practices by which a  board of directors 
ensures  accountability , fairness and transparency  in a company's relationship with all its stakeholders. The 
corporate  governance framework consists of (1) explicit and implicit contracts between the  company  and 
the stakeholders for  distribution  of responsibilities, rights and rewards; (2) procedures for reconciling the 
sometimes conflicting interests of stakeholders in accordance with their duties, privileges and  roles ; and 
(3) procedures for proper supervision,  control and information -flows to serve as a system of checks -and-
balances (http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/corporate - governance.html ).

Corporate governance is a framework  of rules and practices by which a  board of  directors  ensures  
accountability , fairness and transparency  in a company's  relationship  with its all st akeholders.  
Good corporate governance increases the integrity and effectiveness of the private sector. Good 
corporate governance assists to avoid business scandals which damage trust in business. It places value 
on good corporate governance by institutiona l investors. Good corporate governance also fosters a 
growing involvement of the private sector in service delivery and it enhances the development of 
systems to prevent and deter corruption in developing countries. It assists in the deregulation and 
integ ration of capital markets and recognises the importance of harnessing domestic savings for 
domestic growth.  
The King IV Report on Corporate Governance for South Africa was published on 1 November 2016 and 
became effective in April 2017. It applies to entit ies incorporated in and resident in South Africa. The 
Report spells out the framework for governance compliance. The philosophy of the Report revolves 
around three issues, namely ethical leadership, sustainability and corporate citizenship, which is referr ed 
to as the "value dimensions of the Report".  
• Corporate citizenship. Corporate citizenship involves a concern for people, planet and profit issues. 
Defined formally, corporate citizenship entails a concern for the social, environmental and economic 
perfor mance of the organisation and a concern for the role, scope and purpose of the organisation.  
• Ethical leadership. Ethical leadership refers to directing and controlling an organisation in such a 
way that it promotes good corporate governance.  
•  Sustainability. Sustainability is the long -term maintenance of systems according to environmental, 
economic and social considerations.  
Value dimensions of the King IV report on Corporate Governance:  
• corporate citizenship  
• ethical leadership  
• sustainability  
Activity  
To complete this activity, you need to consult the King IV Report on Corporate Gover - 
nance. What does the King IV Report state in terms of strategic review and control in  
organisations?  
 
77  
Feedback  
The Report is very clear in terms of strategy review and control and states that the board of 
directors of an organisation should perform strategy reviews at least annually, that it should be 
as objective as possible and that it must be based on facts rather than on opinions. The board of 
directors may also consider using external consultants with the review process and to gather 
relevant data. The following qu estions needs to be answered: (i) is the organisation adequately 
organised to execute strategy?; (ii) is the organisation's strategic direction still viable and does it 
consistently correspond with the strategic vision and the expectations of all stakehold ers?; (iii) is 
the implementation of strategy still proceeding in a satisfactory manner?; and (iv) are there any 
strategic options that must be explored at this moment?  
Questions for discussion on the myUnisa Discussion Forums  
The King Report on Corporate Governance is a ground -breaking booklet of guidelines for the 
governance structures and operation of companies in South Africa. It is issued by the King Committee 
on Corporate Governance. Four reports have been issued, starting  in 1994 (King I), in 2002 (King II), in 
2009 (King III) and a fourth revision (King IV) in 2016. The Institute of Directors in Southern Africa 
(IoDSA) owns the copyright of the King Report on Corporate Governance and the King Code of 
Corporate Governance.  Compliance with the King Reports is a requirement for companies listed on 
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange . The King Report on Corporate Governance has been cited as "the 
most effective summary of the  best international practices in corporate governance".  
Discuss the essence of these reports.

8.8 CONCLUSION  
Strategies are long term and resource intensive, and can affect the fortunes of the whole organisation. For 
these reasons, strategic control is important to ensure that the chosen strategies are still valid, and that 
the implementation of the chosen strate gies is on track. Strategic control cannot be backward looking, 
given the long -term focus of strategies. Therefore, the focus must be on being proactive and identifying 
strategic issues (those issues inside or outside the organisation that may affect the a chievement of 
strategic objectives negatively). In addition, strategic planning and implementation processes have to be 
integrated with organisational performance management systems to ensure that the work of every 
individual in the organisation is aligned  with the strategy of the organisation. This is where tools like the 
balanced scorecard is particularly important. All organisations are exposed to risk and need to manage 
risk and strategic risks effectively.

Corporate gover nance is an essential component of strategic risk management. This lesson concludes the 
module Strategy Implementation and Control. In this lesson we emphasised the importance of strategic 
control, the management of strategic risk and corporate governance.  
We sincerely hope that this module has provided you with the opportunity to identify, analyse, interpret 
and critically evaluate the choices that business managers make in implementing and controlling 
business -level strategies. Although the focus of this module is on business -level strategies, the principles 
that we have covered will also apply to the implementation and control of strategies on lower levels of 
management. For example, the implementation of functional strtaegies will also require change 
management, organisational learning, resource allocation, responsible leadership and so on. We hope 
that you have found the course content interesting and that you will be able to apply the theory provided 
in practical situations and that it will enhance your  further studies and career.

Practising Strategy  
A southern African context  
There are a number of strategy books, international and local, available in the South African market. Why another one? What 
makes this book different?  
This publication focuses on strategy implementation and not just on the thinking and analytical aspects of strategic 
management . 
It explores the idea that strategy is often emergent, messy and experimental, unlike other strategic management 
books, which unrealistically portray it as a neat, analytical and rational process.  
It unpacks the recent concept that other strategists, not only just senior management, influence strategic direction.  
It recognises strategy as something people do rather than something an organisation possesses. Since people are 
building blocks of strategy, it is a cognitive and political activity.  
It uses p rimary research conducted among southern African top and middle managers and draws on these managerial 
perspectives to enrich the text with first -hand accounts of strategy experience.  
The second edition of the book features a number of new chapters, focusi ng on strategy implementation and change 
management, resource allocation and responsible leadership. It also includes a more detailed coverage of managing 
strategic risk.

INDEX  ................................ ................................ ................................ .......   Preface  
A question that I was asked often when writing and compiling this book (and that, in all 
honesty, I had asked myself more than once) was: why another strategy book? There were, 
after all, quite a number of books, international and local, already available on the South 
African market. It became clear that we had to position this book definitively to make a 
unique contribution to the extant body of knowledge.  
So how, then, is this book different? We believe that there are five key aspects:  
¦ A cursory review of strategic management books shows that the focus is very strongly 
on the process of strategy formulation, i.e. the thinking and analytical aspects of 
strategic management, as opposed to the 'doing' part of strategy, which is often 
dealt with in one or two chapters towards the end. Given that it  is the greatest 
challenge to managers in the 21st century and the greatest reason for strategy 
failure, we decided to focus on strategy implementation instead.  
¦ Most strategic management books portray strategic management as a neat, analytical 
and rational  process that flows from top to bottom in the organisation. Rather than 
promoting the unrealistic idea of strategy as a purely rational and deliberate 
outcome, we acknowledge and explore the idea that strategy is often emergent, 
messy and experimental, and  above all a human activity.  
¦ Top management has long been regarded as the custodians of strategy. The idea that 
there are other strategists (human and non -human actors) such as middle managers 
and consultants that influence the strategic direction of the o rganisation and 
distribution of resources emerged only relatively recently, and we include this factor.  
¦ We focus on strategy as something that people ‘do’ rather than something that an 
organisation 'possesses'. Since people are the building blocks of strat egy, we 
recognise that strategy is both a cognitive and political activity.  
¦ Most South African textbooks rely on secondary sources. While we use recent 
secondary sources from the extant body of knowledge, we conducted primary 
research among southern Africa n top and middle managers and drew on these 
managerial perspectives to enrich our material with firsthand accounts of the strategy 
experience.  
We trust that you will find value in the contemporary and different perspectives we present 
in this book.

Why do business organisations exist? Take a few moments to ponder 
this question. Business organisations exist for various reasons. 
Entrepreneurs generate new business ideas, determine the feasibility 
and viability of these ideas and start new bus iness ventures, in which 
resources are transformed into need -satisfying products and services, 
which are then sold to customers. The entrepreneur hopefully realises a 
profit, of which a part thereof is reinvested in the business organisation 
in order to gr ow and develop the business, ensure its long -term 
survival, create jobs, contribute to the wealth and wellbeing of society 
and remunerate the owners for the investment made in the 
organisation. As the business grows, the role of the entrepreneur 
changes fr om being the inventor of new ideas, to the manager of the 
business organisation. The bigger the organisation becomes, the more 
complicated the management process becomes, which bring us to the 
next fundamental question - what is the best way to manage an 
organisation?  
When we study the evolution of management theory, this is the 
one recurring theme that management theorists attempt to answer. Do 
a quick Google search for the best way to manage an organisation. You 
will find thousands of views on this topic - ranging from ‘tips to 
manage a small business' to 'how to manage a big corporate 
effectively and efficiently’. The reason for the numerous views on this 
topic is to enable us to see the proposed ‘best’ way to manage a 
business organisation in the context  of the social, political, economic, 
technological, international, and ecological forces that affect 
organisations and society at a specific time. As these forces change 
(and they change constantly and at an accelerating pace), business 
managers need to ch ange and adapt to changing circumstances in the 
management environment. Changing circumstances lead to great 
uncertainties for businesses, particularly in respect of their 
sustainability and management.  
The opening case provides us with an example of a hig hly 
successful organisation that did extremely well on ground level - there 
were 88 Health and Racquet Clubs in South Africa and 22 abroad, 
realising a turnover in excess of R1 billion in December 1999,  
 
2 with after -tax profits of R100 million per annum. The company 
employed thousands of people and had a membership in excess of one 
million. In spite of its good financial performance, the company failed. 
Why? Firstly, the reason for the company's failure can be ascribed to a 
lack of strategic management. The company's board, which is mainly 
responsible for strategic management and leadership, became 
dysfunctional,  resulting in a company that lacked strategic direction, a 
coherent strategic plan, and an effective and efficient management 
team to implement the strategic plans, and well - formulated action 
plans. Lastly, poor and ineffective communication, with little concern 
for corporate governance, led to the failure of the company.  
The purpose of this book is to provide the reader with the 
necessary background and information, to be able to practise strategy 
successfully in the contemporary business environment. Ess entially this 
means to:  
develop a long -term and coherent strategic plan within the 
opportunities and constraints of the business environment, 
that leads to the development of strategic actions that 
need to be implemented and controlled, that will put the 
organisation in a position of advantage and enable it to 
survive over the long term and realise its long -term vision, 
goals and plans.  
Before we can focus on practising strategy, we first need to address the 
relationship between general management and strat egic management. 
This chapter will commence with an explanation of managers, 
management and the management process, the various levels and 
areas of management, followed by an explanation of the hierarchy of 
organisational plans. Thereafter, we will focus o n the composition of 
the management environment, stakeholder and stakeholder 
relationship management. Finally, competitive advantage, sustainable 
competitive advantage and transient competitive advantage will be 
addressed.  
3 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Case study  
LeisureNet - Death of a business  
For a few weeks in September and October 2000, Peter Flack was the interim chief executive 
officer of the ill -fated South African company LeisureNet. He had been called in as a 
turnaround specialist. He found that the company had deteriorated so far and so fast that all 
that could be done for it was to close it.  
LeisureNet was a large business, but the lessons Flack draws from the LeisureNet 
failure need to be learned by every manager. Flack's account of one of South Africa's most 
spectacular corporate failures is briefly provided below.  
Every organisation, whether it be a club, church, company or country, requires four 
basic ingredients for it to be successful. These are leader ship, a strategic plan, a management 
team capable of implementing the strategy, and an action plan which breaks the strategic 
plan down into measurable bits. A business is measured against these factors.  
LeisureNet, a successful and profitable company, invited one of the directors of 
Coronation FRM to sit on their board. A brief look at the results for the year to December 
1999 showed a group with a turnover in excess of R1 billion and which made in excess of 
R100 million after tax per annum. As a rough rule of thumb, companies that produce after -
tax profits equal to 10 per cent of gross revenue are considered healthy businesses.  
The company operated 85 Health and Racquet (HEtR) Clubs in South Africa and 
employed 4,500 people who provided an excellent ser vice to nearly one million club 
members. In addition, the company expanded offshore and had built 22 HEtR Clubs in 
Australia, Britain, Germany and Spain, with a number being in the process of construction. On 
the surface, LeisureNet was a company with stro ng leadership, a clear strategy and an 
obviously competent management team.  
At the first board meeting that Flack attended, it was clear that the board had 
become dysfunctional and there was conflict between the executive and non -executive 
directors. The p revious joint chief executive officer of LeisureNet had been transferred to 
Healthland International Limited (again as joint chief executive officer). Healthland 
International Limited was a company that operated health and fitness clubs in Australia. The 
previous leaders had sold almost all their interests in LeisureNet and had been awarded a 
substantial and meaningful stake, free of charge, in Healthland International Limited. 
LeisureNet's young managing director of the South African operations had been ap proached 
to take the job as CEO of LeisureNet but had not accepted the position, and the terms of his 
appointment had not been finalised. It was clear that there was a problem with leadership.  
Part of the conflict at board level was due to the fact the Lei sureNet had been used to 
fund, staff and train employees of Healthland. The HEtR Club business had been pillaged to 
establish Healthland's operations and all available cash had been invested in Healthland and 
little, if any, in the HEtR Club business. Some  R370 million of this available cash had come 
from selling shares. The result was a lack of maintenance and refurbishment at HEtR Clubs.  
4 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
On close r examination, there was no strategic plan. A strategy, which is not reduced to 
writing, is a hope, wish or prayer, but not a plan. A strategic plan requires that its participants 
follow a procedure, which identifies and analyses the various internal and e xternal issues that 
affect the business.  
The lack of a coherent strategic plan in LeisureNet can be seen from the fact that the 
company had over the previous five years, when it was still in business, also established a 
food business, a golfing business, a n education business, a casino bid, a gymnasium 
equipment supplier, a restaurant and the six -member Imax theatre chain. Despite the fact 
that LeisureNet owned only half the equity of the Imax group, the company guaranteed 100 
per cent of the leases of the purpose -built facilities housing the theatres and which extended 
over 13 -20 years.  
Structure follows strategy and the lack of strategy manifested itself in the 
composition of the board of directors of LeisureNet. Instead of the various disciplines 
inherent  in a company being represented on the board of directors, for example, finance, 
information systems, human resources and the line operations, the board consisted of two 
former joint chief executive officers, the managing director of the local operations a nd a host 
of non -executive directors.  
Although the management information system was homegrown and, in many 
instances, required a duplication of effort, the accounting system, sales system, marketing 
and human resources procedures were well thought out. In  moving offshore with Healthland 
International Limited, the business there had adopted the best of the local operating 
systems, acquired a standard management information system and had recruited the most 
senior of the local managers. The glaring omission,  however, related to the position of chief 
financial officer and the treasury and cash management functions for this massively cash -
hungry growth business in a state of rapid development. Ultimately, this gap in the 
management structure caused the downfall  of Healthland as there was no action plan of any 
kind.  
The group, with the notable exception of the HStR Club business, did not meet, let 
alone pass, any of the standards required by the four components for any successful 
business, namely, leadership, str ategic planning, management and action planning. There 
were two other glaring omissions, namely, a lack of corporate communications and 
corporate governance.  
The group could have been saved had it been possible to raise sufficient money to 
complete the bui lding of the Healthland clubs under construction, or if the sale of these 
offshore clubs could have been concluded in a way that would have released LeisureNet 
from its obligations to the Healthland group. In the end, both attempts failed. Both of these 
failures can be traced back to fundamental flaws in the issues of leadership, strategy, 
corporate communications and corporate governance.

5 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
LO 1:  Explain  the concepts  ‘manager1 and 'management'.  
1.1 Managers and management  
Although the term ‘manager’ has many meanings, for the purpose of this chapter, we will 
define a manager as a person who is responsible for running a part of or an entire 
organisation. The term ‘management’ refers to the interlocking functions that managers 
perform. For the purposes of this book, management is defined as:  
the process of working with and through others to achieve organisational  
objectives in a changing environment  
Managers experience more pressure today than at any other time in history. Changes in the 
world that are impacting on managers include the growing globalisation of economies, 
technological innovations, trends towards democratisation, increasing social imbalances 
and climate change, to mention only a few. In South Africa, the credit rating agency S£tP 
Global downgraded the country’s credit rating in November 2017 to full junk status, while 
its counterpart Moody’s placed  the country on review for a downgrade. The downgrading 
followed a similar announcement by third major rating agency Fitch, affirming South 
Africa’s rating at sub -investment or so -called ‘junk status’. The reason for the downgrade 
by this agency was the we ak economic growth in the country that led to the deterioration of 
public finances beyond previous expectations. It also flagged the role that the political 
turmoil of the country played in hamstringing policy.1 Having a credit rating at sub -
investment lev el means that South Africa is not regarded as a country with good investment 
opportunities and investors will be hesitant to invest money in the country’s private and 
public sectors - resulting in a slower economic growth rate, a lower gross national produ ct, 
and a threat to business managers.  
Business managers need to cope with diverse and far -reaching challenges such as 
these constantly. They have to keep pace with ever -advancing technology and find ways to 
incorporate the internet and e -business into the ir strategies and business models. They must 
strive to remain competitive in the face of increasingly tough global competition, uncertain 
environments, cutbacks in personnel and resources, and massive economic, political and 
social shifts. The diversity of  the workforce creates other dynamics: How can managers 
maintain a strong corporate culture while supporting diversity, balancing work and family 
concerns, and coping with the conflicting demands of all employees for a fair chance at 
power and responsibili ty? The field of management is undergoing a revolution that requires 
managers to do more with less, to see change rather than stability as the nature of things, 
and to create a vision and cultural values that enable people to create a truly collaborative 
and enabling workplace.  
Successful organisations don’t just happen; they are managed to be that way. To be 
successful under such circumstances, every organisation needs skilled managers. In our 
opening case, we saw a once successful organisation that closed  due to poor management 
and more specifically, poor strategic management.  
6 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
The question that we can ask ourselves now is what should managers do to achieve 
organisational objectives as effectively and efficiently as possible within a changing 
environment? The objective of this chapter is to provide the reader with a contemporary 
view of general management principles and the application thereof in m odern organisations, 
and to demonstrate the relationship between these general management principles and 
strategic management. This will lay the foundation for the contemporary strategic 
management principles that will be discussed in the remainder of the book. Everything 
addressed in subsequent chapters of this book relates to practising strategy in contemporary 
organisations and the job of the modern strategist.  
LO 2:  Explain  the management  process,  indicating  the four characteristics  thereof.  
1.2 The managem ent process  
For the purposes of this book, management is defined as:  
the process of working with and through others to achieve organisational objectives 
in a changing environment.  
Although this may seem to be a very simplistic definition, we can identify four major 
characteristics, namely:  
(1) management is a process  
(2) management entails working with and through others  
(3) management aims to contribute to the realisation of organisational goals and 
objectives, and in doing so, management needs to balance effectivene ss and 
efficiency and makes the most of limited and scarce resources  
(4) management needs to cope with a changing environment.  
Each of these components will be discussed in more detail below.  
1.2.1  Management is a process  
In general, a process can be described as a structured, interrelated set of activities that, 
when executed, produce a specific output. The management function in an organisation can 
also be viewed as a process.  
Managers need certain inputs (or resources) to deliver certain outputs (or 
performance). Managers need people (human resources); capital (financial resources), 
physical resources, raw materials, components, information, and entrepreneurial and 
management skills to produce products and/or services, create jobs, make a profit, achieve 
organisati onal goals and add value, and contribute to the wealth of society. The 
transformation of inputs to outputs requires management to perform certain activities or 
functions. All managers, regardless of the type of organisation, the  
7 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
level at which they are involved, their designated role(s) or specific skills, engage in some 
manner in four fundamental, interrelated activities in order to achieve some or other 
goal(s), also called the man agement functions. These functions are planning, organising, 
leading, and controlling.  
¦ Planning is the management function that determines the organisation’s vision, 
mission, strategic direction and goals. It involves identifying ways of realising the 
goal s, adding value to the organisation and its stakeholders and finding the resources 
needed for the task within a complex environment. Plans are mostly made by top 
management and its duration varies from one to five or even ten years. These are 
called ‘strat egic plans’. Tactical plans are made by functional managers (such as 
financial, human resources, research and development, marketing and operations 
managers) to support the organisation’s long -term plans. Operational plans are made 
by lower management (oft en called ‘first - line’ or ‘supervisory’ management) to plan 
for short periods ahead. Planning has a top -down nature in organisations, originating 
from top management and cascading down to lower levels of management and even at 
the level of the individual worker in an organisation.  
¦ Organising is the second step in the management process. Once the goals and plans 
have been determined, management has to allocate the organisation’s resources to 
relevant departments or individuals. Tasks, roles and responsibili ties must be defined 
and policies and procedures established to achieve the goals. Thus, organising 
involves developing a framework or organisational structure to indicate how people 
and other resources should be deployed to achieve the goals. The success of an 
organisation lies in directing the different resources towards the achievement of a 
common set of goals. The better the resources are co -ordinated and organised, the 
more successful the organisation will be. Because organisations have different goals  
and resources, it stands to reason that each one should have an organisational structure 
that will accommodate its needs. Management must match the organisation’s structure 
to its strategies. This process is called ‘organisational design’.  
¦ Managers are re sponsible for getting things done through other people - they 
collaborate with their superiors, peers and subordinates, with both individuals and 
groups, to attain the goals of the organisation. Leading the organisation entails using 
influence and power to  motivate employees to achieve goals. Leading from the top 
means communicating strategic goals and motivating departments, sections and 
individuals to perform as well as they can.  
¦ Controlling means that managers should constantly make sure that the organis ation is 
on the right course to attain its goals. Control also enables management to identify and 
rectify any deviations from the plans, and to consider factors which might oblige them 
to revise their goals and plans.  
It is important to realise that the fu nctions of management do not occur in a tidy, step -by-
step order. At any given time, a manager is likely to be engaged in several management 
functions simultaneously.  
8 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND  STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
While performing the planning, organising, leading and controlling functions, managers are 
constantly faced with opportunities and threats that need to be addressed and decisions that 
need to be made. When planning, a manager needs to  make decisions about goals and when, 
where and how they should be realised. When controlling, the manager may find out that 
the goals have not been realised. Thus, a problem exists that needs to be solved and the 
manager needs to decide on the most approp riate course of action. When organising, 
managers must make decisions that involve the creation of an organisational structure and 
the deployment of resources that will enable the organisation to attain its goals. When 
leading, the manager must decide how to influence and direct the behaviour of followers so 
that they willingly pursue the goals of the organisation. Decision -making is therefore a 
central aspect of all four managerial functions. In the opening case, managers (and the 
senior manager especially ) at LeisureNet made poor decisions, resulting in the failure of 
the organisation.  
The term ‘resources’ is extremely comprehensive. The following basic resources can 
be found in all organisations, namely, people (human resources), money (capital or 
financi al resources), raw materials (physical resources), knowledge (information 
resources), technology, information and components. Management utilises these resources 
to achieve the goals of the organisation as efficiently and effectively as possible. Resources  
are scarce and management’s biggest challenge is to utilise its resources as productively as 
possible. Managers need to make choices in terms of what programmes, projects and 
activities to pursue with the limited resources at their disposal. Managers also  have the task 
of bringing resources together, deciding which resources are necessary for a specific 
situation or specific circumstances, and in what quantities, to achieve the organisation’s 
goals. The success with which an organisation achieves its goals  and satisfies the ever -
increasing needs of society depends on the competence of its managers in utilising its 
scarce resources. If managers utilise resources well, the organisation will be successful. If 
a country’s organisations are competitive and succe ssful, the country as a whole will 
prosper because successful organisations satisfy needs, not only by producing products and 
services, but also by providing jobs and contributing to the wealth of society. The inputs or 
resources of an organisation are tra nsformed to realise certain outputs, of which goal 
achievement, products, services, profit, job creation, efficiency and effectiveness are the 
most important outputs.  
In the case study, we saw the detrimental effect of the poor management of 
LeisureNet’s f inancial resources - LeisureNet was used to fund, staff and train employees 
of Healthland. The Health and Racket Club business was pillaged to establish Healthland’s 
operations and all available cash was invested in Healthland, with very little in the Heal th 
and Racket Club business. This resulted in a lack of maintenance and refurbishment at 
Health and Racket Clubs.  
1.2.2  Management entails working with and through others  
Managers get things done by working with and through other people. Management is, above 
all else, a social process. Many collective purposes bring individuals together  
9 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
- building houses and cars, publishing books, offering tertiary education, providing 
personal financial services,  and so on. The activities that are needed to build a house or a 
car, publish a book, offer tertiary education programmes and to provide advice on personal 
finances, cannot happen on their own. In all cases, managers are needed to get things done 
by workin g with and through other people and other organisations.  
The ability to work with and through others is therefore an important skill that 
managers should have in order to be successful. Problems with interpersonal relationships 
and failure to build and lea d a team are often the reasons why managers fail, as we have 
already seen in the case study of this chapter.  
1.2.3 Management aims to achieve organisational goals and 
objectives, balance effectiveness and efficiency, and 
make the most of limited resources  
An objective can be described as a target to be strived for. A university student, for 
example, can set an objective for him or herself, to graduate with a specific degree by a 
given date. All actions taken or activities performed by the student, will be w ith the view to 
achieve this target. As with individuals, organisations formulate organisational objectives. 
Organisations will also be more successful when their activities are guided by challenging, 
yet realistic and achievable objectives. Organisational  goals and objectives serve later as 
measuring sticks for performance. Without goals and objectives, the management process 
would be aimless and wasteful. In the case study, we determined that the absence of 
organisational goals and objectives, contributed  to the failure of the company.  
It is important to distinguish between the concepts of effectiveness and efficiency. 
Effectiveness is achieved when the organisation formulates and pursues appropriate (or 
stated) goals. Effectiveness, in essence, means ‘doi ng the right things’ in order to achieve 
the objectives of the organisation.  
Given the reality of limited resources, effectiveness alone is not enough. An 
organisation also needs to be efficient. Efficiency enters the picture when the resources 
required to  achieve an objective are weighed against what was accomplished. The 
organisation will be more efficient if the ratio between benefits (outputs or performance) 
and costs (inputs or resources) is more favourable. Efficiency essentially means ‘doing 
things r ight’. Efficiency is achieved by using the fewest inputs (such as the number of 
people employed or the amount of capital utilised during the financial year) to generate a 
maximum amount of output (such as a number of products produced or the profit realise d 
within a financial year).  
Managers are responsible for balancing effectiveness and efficiency. Too much 
emphasis on either effectiveness or efficiency leads to mismanagement. On the one hand, 
managers must be effective by getting the job done. On the oth er hand, managers need to be 
efficient by reducing costs and not wasting resources.  CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
Too much emphasis on effectiveness will mean that the job gets done, but limited resources 
are wasted. Too much emphasis on efficiency will mean that the job gets done, but 
available resources are underutilised. Thus, the answer lies in a balanced emphasis on 
effectiveness and efficiency - the job gets done and limite d resources are not wasted.  
In a business context, organisations have access to limited and scarce resources and 
managers need to make the most of these resources. In the bigger picture, we live in a 
world of scarcity and limited resources. Although expert s and non -experts alike may 
quibble over exactly how long it will take to exhaust our non -renewable resources or come 
up with exotic new technological alternatives, one fact remains: our planet is becoming 
increasingly crowded and sustainability and sustai nable development should be among the 
main concerns for managers. Organisational sustainability means to maintain, to keep 
being, to preserve and to support, with structures to hold on to. For an organisation to be 
sustainable, it must sustain its resource s and the uses thereof. It also means that 
organisations should balance their social, environmental (ecological) and financial aspects 
- the so -called ‘triple -bottom line’ which will be further explained in Section 1.7 of this 
chapter. In productive organi sations, managers are the custodians of limited and scarce 
resources and it is their job to see that the basic factors of production are used efficiently 
and effectively.  
1.2.4. Management needs to cope with a changing 
environment  
Successful managers are the ones who anticipate and adjust to changing circumstances 
rather than those who are passively swept along or caught unprepared. In Section 1.5, we 
will elaborate on the management environment.  
We can conclude this section with Business Week's  amusing bu t challenging profile 
of tomorrow’s managers: The next generation of corporate leaders will need the charm of a 
debutante, the flexibility of a gymnast, and the quickness of a panther. A few foreign 
languages and a keen understanding' of technology won’t h urt either’.2 
LO 3:  Differentiate  between  the various  levels  of management.  
1.3 Levels of management  
The management process and functions of management, explained in the previous section, 
merely provide us with a starting point for understanding what management and strategic 
management, specifically, entails. To add to the complexity of the process, management 
takes place at different levels and in different areas within organisations. While managers 
at each level and in each area must generally posses s planning, organising, leading and 
controlling skills, certain job -specific activities and skills are more important at one level 
than at another.  
11 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Managers function at various levels in the organisational hierarchy. A small organisation 
may have only one layer of management, whereas a medium - to large sized organisation may 
have several layers. In general, relatively large organisations (especially governmental 
organisations) have three l evels of management: top -level managers, middle managers and 
lower -level managers.  
¦ Top management, also referred to as senior management, represents the relatively 
small group of managers who control the organisation as a whole and with whom the 
final auth ority and responsibility for executing the management process rest. Top 
management is responsible for strategic planning that includes determining the vision, 
mission, strategic direction, overall goals, strategies and plans of the organisation. 
Top manage ment is concerned mainly with strategic planning that has the following 
characteristics: first, strategic planning focuses on the entire organisation; second, it 
aims to reconcile the organisation’s strengths and weaknesses in its internal 
environment, wit h the threats and opportunities in the external environment; third, 
strategic planning focuses on creating and maintaining a competitive advantage for the 
organisation; fourth, it considers synergy and aims to co -ordinate the efforts of 
departments and ind ividuals to contribute to the attainment of competitive advantage 
and the long -term goals of the organisation; lastly, strategic plans filter down in the 
organisation to form the basis of tactical and operational plans.  
Top managers are also responsible for designing the organisation’s broad 
organisational structure, leading the organisation (through the top executive) and 
controlling it. Top management also influences the corporate culture, organisational 
change, the allocation of resources on corporate level and determines the culture of 
the organisation in terms of organisational learning. Strategic managers continuously 
monitor the external and internal environment of the organisation to identify possible 
opportunities, threats, strengths and weaknesse s. The annual reports of organisations 
usually depict their top management structure. This level of management generally 
comprises the board of directors, partners, the managing director, chief executive 
officers, management committees and other governing bodies. In this book, the focus 
will be on the top management of organisations and their responsibilities in terms of 
strategic management. Traditionally, top managers were considered the only people 
responsible for strategic management. The contemporary v iew of management 
suggests that top managers alone are not the only strategists and that any individual or 
group in an organisation that controls key actions can be regarded as a role -player in 
strategic management.  
¦ Middle management, also referred to as f unctional management, is responsible for 
specific departments or functions of the organisation. Middle management primarily 
deals with tactical planning and implementing the policies, plans and strategies 
formulated by top management. It normally includes the functional heads, such as the 
marketing manager, the financial manager, the purchasing manager and the human 
resources manager. Middle management is concerned with the near future and is 
therefore responsible for medium -term and short term planning, or ganising functional 
areas, leading by means of the departmental  
12 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
heads, and controlling the management activities of the middle managers’ own 
departments. Middle managers also continually monitor environmental influences that 
may affect their own departments. The trend in recent years of corporate restructuring, 
delayering, downsizing and decentralisation of decision -making has been responsible 
for large numbers of middle managers being made redundant. Electronic technology 
has reduced the need for middle management in some organisations. In the area of 
information management, in particular, computers have replaced the information -
gathering tasks of  middle managers. Middle managers are, however, still essential in 
linking the upper and lower levels of the organisation and in implementing the 
strategies developed at the executive level.  
¦ Lower -level management (also called supervisory or first -line management) is 
responsible for even smaller segments of the organisation, namely, the different 
subsections. The managerial functions of first -line managers are centred around the 
daily activities of their departments or sections, on short -term planning, a nd on 
implementing the plans of middle management. Their primaiy concern is to apply 
policies, procedures and rules in order to achieve a high level of productivity, to 
provide technical assistance, to motivate subordinates and to accomplish day -to-day 
goals. Typically, they spend a large portion of their time supervising the work of 
subordinates. Because of this, first -line management is a vital force in the 
organisation. These managers hold the power to increase or decrease the productivity 
and output of most organisations. They also maintain the crucial interface between 
management and the major body of employees in the organisation. This level of 
management usually comprises titles such as office manager, shift supervisor, 
advertising manager, debtors’ c lerk or section manager.  
LO 4:  Explain  the various areas of management.  
1.4 Areas of management  
We can distinguish between various functional areas of management in organisations, 
namely, finance, operations, human resources, procurement, research and developm ent, 
public relations and marketing.  
¦ The financial function is  responsible for  obtaining  the necessary finances for  
an organisation at the lowest cost, investing these finances in assets that would earn 
greater returns than the cost of capital, as well as managing the profitability, liquidity 
and solvency of the organisation.  
¦ The operations function  includes that  group of  activities concerned with  
the actual provision of  goods and services to  the organisation’s clients.  
Operations management  systematically  designs,  directs and controls the  
process that transforms inputs into products and services for both internal and external 
customers.  
13 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
¦ The human resources function involves the appointment , development and maintenance 
of the human resources of the organisation. To enable the organisation to operate at 
optimum levels, the human resources manager must appoint the right people and 
provide them with the right training in order to make the best use of them.  
¦ The procurement function is concerned with buying the materials and resources needed 
to create products and services. The manager responsible for procurement needs to 
balance a number of constraints. He/she needs to ensure that the right product is 
available, at the right time, in the right quantity and of the right quality, at the best 
possible price.  
¦ The research and development function is responsible for developing new products and 
services and improving old products and services. This  function is critical in 
organisations that operate in fast -changing environments, such as information 
technology, communications, and so on.  
¦ The public relations function of an organisation is responsible for creating a 
favourable, objective image of the organisation and for establishing good relationships 
with those directly or indirectly concerned with the business and its products or 
services.  
¦ The marketing function is responsible for getting the final customer and client to buy 
the organisation’s produ cts or services. The marketing function is concerned with new 
product development, promotion and distribution.  
While all the functions listed above are specialised areas of management, which require 
more specific and specialist skills, managers in each are a still plan, organise, lead and 
control. A financial manager, for example, is responsible for determining the financial 
goals of the organisation, thus performing the planning function of management. The 
financial manager also needs to organise financial activities by allocating financial tasks to 
people so that financial goals can be achieved. The financial manager takes the lead in 
financial activities, motivating and directing members of staff in the financial section to 
perform their duties in pursuit of the financial targets. Lastly, financial managers need to 
ensure that financial goals are accomplished through the implementation of financial 
control mechanisms.  
LO 5:  Explain  the hierarchy  of organisational  plans  and depict  it diagrammatically.  
1.5 The hierarchy of organisational plans  
From the discussions so far, we have learned that management is a process and that 
managers engage in some manner in four fundamental, interrelated activities (planning, 
organising, leading and control) in order to realise  the goals of an organisation and to add 
value to the organisation and society. These activities are executed on various hierarchical 
levels of an organisation, and the focus of strategic management and of this book, is on the 
highest of these levels, name ly, top or senior management. The  
14 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
planning stage of the management process is a top -down approach, which entails top 
managers formulating a stra tegic plan, which is a document that indicates the direction of 
the organisation. A strategic plan consists of the following seven elements: vision; mission; 
analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT analysis); core 
organisatio nal values; goals; objectives and strategies.  
¦ Strategic plans filter down in the organisation and form the basis of tactical plans 
crafted on middle management levels.  
¦ Tactical plans focus on the functional areas of the organisation, are more specific than  
strategic plans and should take synergy into account. So, in other words, it should 
contribute to the attainment of the overall organisational goals. Tactical plans form 
the basis of operational plans, developed by middle and lower levels of management.  
¦ Operational plans are narrowly focused, with a relatively short time horizon. Three 
basic forms of operational plans exist, namely, single -use, standing, and individual 
plans.  
¦ Single -use plans are used once to meet the needs of a particular or unique situat ion. 
Programmes, projects and budgets are examples of single -use plans. In this context, a 
programme refers to a set of activities designed to accomplish a specific objective 
over a period of time. A programme consists of various projects, with predetermin ed 
completion dates and budgets. A budget can be described as a numerical plan for 
allocating resources to specific predetermined activities.  
¦ Standing plans provide guidance because they deal with issues or problems that occur 
frequently. Policies, procedures and rules are examples of standing plans.  
¦ Operational plans form the basis of individual plans, which are defined as the broader 
organisational plans that are translated into plans for the individual worker. It is also 
on the individual level th at the implementation and execution of strategic plans 
commence, from where they culminate in the realisation of operational goals, and, 
ultimately, in the strategic goals of the organisation. The hierarchy of plans is 
depicted in Figure 1.1.  
For managers to formulate realistic operational and individual plans, they need clear 
guidance and plans from strategic and tactical managers. Only if the different kinds of 
plans are understood, will lower levels of management and individuals be able to develop 
operat ional and individual plans.  
The execution of the fundamental managerial activities by all levels and areas of 
management does not happen in isolation - the organisation (as a system) is part of a bigger 
system that we refer to as the management environment . The composition of the 
management environment is described in the next section.

LO 6:  Explain  the composition  of the management  environment.  
1.6 The composition of the management environment  
It is crucial to realise that organisations and their managements, source inputs from the 
environment, transform them into outputs, which are then returned to the environment. 
These are the main elements of any system: input -? transformation -+ output. The success 
of the organisation as a system is largely determined by the efficiency and effectiveness 
illustrated by its management in performing planning, organising, leading and controlling 
functions. Furthermore, a system’s success depends on successful interactions with its 
environment. In this context, the environment includes other sub -environments such as 
suppliers, labour unions, financial institutions, customers, and so on. The organisation is 
dependent on its external environment. Managements must therefore understand the 
structure and dynamics of the unique management environment of  their organisations and, 
even more importantly, the unique strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats 
pertaining to the environment that impact directly or indirectly on the success of the 
organisation.  
16 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSH IP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
As the first step to a better understanding of the management environment, it is important 
for the manager to take account of its structure and dynamics. Without such an 
understanding, no re alistic strategising can take place. Structurally, the management 
environment can be divided into the micro -environment, the market environment (industiy) 
and the remote environment.  
1.6.1  The micro - or internal environment  
The micro -environment can also be refe rred to as the internal environment and includes the 
organisation’s functions, policies, strategies, goals, objectives, and available resources, and 
also designates the area over which the manager has total or full control. Vodacom, a 
leading cellular netw ork, has various features that we can identify from its micro -
environment. For example, it represents a culture characterised by a winning spirit and 
passion for the job, progressive human resources policies, commitment to transformation, 
investment in soc ial development programmes, successful staff retention programmes, 
competitive remuneration packages, successful skills development programmes, and 
commitment to ethical conduct and social development. Top or strategic managers play a 
profound role in the establishment of the micro -environment of the organisation. The 
factors in Vodacom’s micro -environment are all under the direct control of its management, 
mainly the strategic managers of the company.  
1.6.2  The external environment  
The external environment comprises two major components, namely the market 
environment and the remote environment. The external environment also designates the 
area outside of the organisation over which the manager has no control.  
1.6.2.1  The market environment  
The market environment lie s between the micro -environment and the remote environment 
and forms a buffer between the organisations and the remote environment. Some authors 
refer to it as the operating, competitive, task environment or industry. Other authors, in 
turn, refer to it as  the ‘meso -environment’ or the intermediate environment. For the purpose 
of this book, we shall refer to it as the ‘market environment’. The market environment 
comprises the following sub -environments: (1) customers (clients), their needs, purchasing 
power , behaviour and bargaining power; (2) suppliers of capital, materials and labour and 
the bargaining power of suppliers; (3) the population from which the organisation recruits 
its labour force and the unions representing it; and (4) competitors, including new entrants, 
existing competitors, the availability of substitute products or services and complementary 
products or services.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
The customer  
Customers can be defined as all those people or organisations that buy products or services 
from other people and other organisations. On the other hand, the market for the 
organisation’s product and/or service consists of people who have needs to be satisfied and 
the financial means with which to satis fy their needs. The customer and the market for an 
organisation’s product and/or service, is the main reason why an organisation exists. This is 
true for both private -sector and public -sector entities. For business entities in the private 
sector, to have n o customers is to have no revenue and no profits; their survival depends on 
the customer. On the other hand, owing to their annual budget allocations from government, 
the supply of public -service entities do not depend, for their survival, on their product s or 
services they supply to their customers, which is the community. Customers also exhibit 
buyer behaviour, which is influenced by variables in the macro -environment. For example, 
demographic trends affect the number of customers, economic trends influen ce the 
purchasing power of consumers, and cultural values can influence the buying behaviour of 
most customers.  
Competitors  
Aside from customers, competitors are the single most important day -to-day force 
associated with an organisation. Competition in the  market environment is a situation in 
which different organisations with more or less the same product or service compete for the 
business patronage by the same consumers. Every organisation that tries to market a service 
and/or product in the market envir onment is constantly up against existing competition. In 
the case of business organisations, the competition is other businesses currently active in 
the same market sector who are competing for a share of the market. New entrants refer to 
potential competi tors that have the resources to enter the current market in which 
established organisations operate.  
A thorough competitor analysis, in which strategic managers should play a major 
role, can help an organisation to understand, interpret and predict its com petitor’s actions 
and responses. Understanding the actions of competitors is clearly an important factor 
contributing to the organisation’s ability to compete successfully.  
The labour market and labour unions  
Although the labour market in economic theory e quates to other markets, such as the 
financial market or the market for products and services, it has its own unique 
characteristics. The labour market comprises many different markets, such as those for 
various skill levels, occupations, age groups, indus tries, genders and geographical regions. 
These markets are to some extent interchangeable, yet barriers to mobility do exist. Another 
important difference between the labour market and other markets is the temporary nature 
of employment relationships. Once  a purchaser buys products for consumption, it becomes 
the property of the buyer. This is not so with the employment relationship. Either the 
employer or employee may decide to terminate the relationships. This leads to greater 
fluidity and unpredictabilit y in the labour  
18 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
market. Organisation’s ability to attract and retain capable employees from the labour 
market is essential to its success. This ability, on the one hand, is greatly influenced by the 
strategic managers of an organisation. On the other hand, an organisation’s personnel 
recruitment and selection alternatives are often influenced by the nature of both its external 
and its internal env ironments. An organisation’s access to needed personnel is affected 
primarily by three factors, namely, the organisation’s reputation as an employer, local 
economic conditions and subsequent employment rates, as well as the availability of people 
with the required skills. Organisations thus also compete for skilled and competent labour 
with other organisations, where labour unions play an integral role. Again, strategic 
managers play a profound role in determining the organisation’s reputation as an employe r 
and in its ability to attract and retain the necessary skilled human resources.  
Intermediaries  
In addition to consumers, competitors, the labour market and labour unions in the market 
environment, intermediaries also play an important role and affect the  organisation directly 
and indirectly. Intermediaries act as middlemen between the manufacturer of products and 
services and the final consumer thereof. Intermediaries include wholesalers, retailers, 
agents and brokers, all of whom play a role in bringing a product or service from the 
manufacturer to the final consumer. Financial intermediaries, such as banks, insurers and 
other financial institutions, play a role in providing an organisation with the necessary 
capital to start and run a successful business . 
Suppliers  
Organisations need various inputs and depend on suppliers to provide regular supplies of 
these inputs. Most of the inputs used by the organisation form part of a value - creation 
process manifested in the value chain. The value chain can be described as a c hain of 
activities that an organisation, operating in a specific industiy, performs in order to deliver 
a valuable product or service for the market that it serves. Through the use of a value 
chain, value can be created for the role -players and a sustainab le competitive advantage 
created for the organisation. The concentration of suppliers and the availability of 
substitutes are, on the one hand, of extreme importance to the effective functioning and 
survival of the organisation, and, on the other, also sig nificant factors in determining 
supplier bargaining power. The terms competitive advantage  and sustainable competitive 
advantage  will further be clarified in Section 1.8.  
1.6.2.2  The remote environment  
The remote environment refers to the broader environment withi n which the organisation 
must function. The remote environment surrounds the market environment. It includes all 
PESTLE/G (explained in Chapter 5, Section 5.3.1) external influences that do not fall 
directly within the sphere of influence of the organisati on, but which do have a bearing on 
its activities. When analysing the macro -environment, the emphasis falls on the changes 
that the uncontrollable variables at the macro -level  
19 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
cause and the strategic implications these hold for the organisation. For the purpose of 
systematic analysis, a number of sub -environments can be distinguished within the remote 
environment, namely, the political; economic; social, technological; legal; environmenta l; 
and international environments. Each of these sub -environments of the remote environment 
will be discussed below in more detail.  
The political/legislative environment  
The state is a major role -player in the remote environment of an organisation, because  it 
influences the organisation primarily as a regulating force. The state enforces laws, directly 
affecting the way that organisations operate. Tax regulations, for instance, have a direct 
influence on each and every organisation and individual. Value -added taxes (VAT), for 
instance, was 14 per cent in South Africa. In the budget speech delivered on 21 February 
2018, Malusi Gigaba the country’s minister of finance at the time, announced an increase in 
the value -added tax rate of 1 per cent to 15 percent, t he first increase of this tax rate in 25 
years. The country experienced major changes in its political environment in 2018. The 
major leadership changes of the ruling political party, the African National Congress, made 
world news. Former president Jacob Z uma resigned and was replaced with President Cyril 
Ramaphosa, who announced major cabinet changes and declared a country free of 
corruption. These adjustments led to major changes in financial markets, with an increase in 
the value of the country’s currenc y, having a direct impact on organisations, especially 
those involved in multi -national business. With this in mind, strategic managers should be 
aware of changes in this environment that may require them to revisit the organisation’s 
vision, mission state ment, goals and strategies.  
The economic environment  
After technology, the economic environment plays a huge role in the remote environment. 
Organisations are influenced by factors such as business cycles, interest rates, inflation, 
unemployment, trends with regard to the gross national product (GNP) and the economic 
growth rate, monetary and fiscal policy, trends in the balance of payments, the current and 
provisional status of the economy in terms of recession and depression, the influence of 
resources,  and so on. The economy, in turn, is affected by technology, politics, ecology, 
social trends and the international environment. These cross -influences constantly bring 
about fluctuations in the economy, affecting organisations, strategic managers and all other 
levels of management. Strategic management therefore needs to keep abreast of economic 
changes and trends which require them to revisit the organisation’s vision, mission 
statement, goals and strategies.  
The social environment  
The social environment refers to the cultural and demographic aspects of the environment. 
Cultural forces, which underpin society and surround an organisation, are often not as 
visible as other general environmental forces. Culture refers to the unique pattern of shared 
characte ristics, such as values, that distinguish the members  
20 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
of one group of people from another group. A value can be defined as the basic belief about 
a certain condition that has considerable importance and meaning to individuals. People’s 
values are relatively stable over time. A value system comprises multiple beliefs that are 
compatible and supportive of one another. Managers need to appreciate  the significance of 
the values and value systems of all its stakeholders  
- globalisation and global competition is a reality and the number of organisations that 
accept contracts and other assignments in other countries, is rapidly increasing. Realising 
the importance of cultural diversity can help strategic and other managers understand their 
international partners and, ultimately, to be more effective and efficient managers. The 
social environment also includes various demographic factors, such as, the age  distribution 
population growth rate, emphasis on safety, career attitudes, and so on.  
The technological environment  
The technological environment is primarily responsible for changes in the remote 
environment. Technology can be defined as the knowledge, t ools, actions and techniques 
that are used to transform ideas, information, raw materials and components into finished 
products and services. Furthermore, technology encapsulates the physical elements of 
human invention and innovation. Many new technologie s are radical enough to force 
organisations, especially in high -tech industries, to reconsider their vision, purpose and 
methods of operation or face extinction. An analysis of the technological environment is 
crucial for strategic managers.  
The most basic  effect of technology and technological innovation is probably higher 
productivity. The ability of an organisation to produce more and better products poses a 
threat to competitors, compelling them to reassess their strategic plans, organisational 
structur es, production methods, markets and other functional strategies. Effective 
management of technology and innovation is an extremely important source of competitive 
advantage for an organisation.  
The environmental environment  
The environmental environment (a lso referred to as the ecological or physical environment) 
relates to the limited natural resources from which an organisation obtains its raw 
materials. However, organisations also dispose of waste or some of their waste in the 
ecological environment. The  ecological environment consists of the natural environment, as 
well as human -made infrastructure. Geography, the weather and climate, the availability 
and exploitation of natural resources (raw materials, water, and so on), as well as 
conservation agreeme nts and conventions all form part of the natural environment. The 
human -made environment, in turn, refers to the roads, railways, airports, harbours, 
communication infrastructure and energy supplies that have an influence on all 
organisations.  
Organisation s are becoming increasingly aware of the natural environment and the 
interdependence between organisations and the natural environment. This interdependence 
presents opportunities and threats to organisations. One of the major  
21 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
threats is a shortage of natural resources, especially water and energy. The rising cost of 
energy, the cost of pollution, damage to a country’s natural resources and climate changes 
are all threats from the natural environment. Managers should take timely steps to ensure 
that no actions on the part of their organisation have detrimental effects on the 
environment. Sustainability issues, such as green industries, buildings and transport, have 
become crucial fo r strategic management.  
The global environment  
Globalisation and organisations conducting business across the borders of a country is a 
reality. The international environment poses threats, as well as opportunities for 
organisations. Strategic managers nee d to consider these for successful strategic 
management in contemporary organisations.  
Within the management environment discussed in this section, all managers, but 
strategic managers, in particular, need to be aware of the various stakeholders in the 
man agement environment. This is the focus of the following section.  
LO 7:  Explain the terms 'stakeholder' and ’stakeholder relationship management'.  
1.7 Stakeholders and stakeholder relationship 
management  
Various views exist in terms of who or what constitutes a  stakeholder of an organisation. 
The so -called narrow view of stakeholder theory refers to stakeholders as a group of 
individuals within the boundaries of the organisation. This view only considers 
stakeholders who are directly linked to the organisation, such as employees, customers and 
financial institutions. The broader view of stakeholder theory looks beyond the 
stakeholders within the organisation. It includes groups within the organisation, as well, as 
those on the outside, such as the community, loca l and national government.  
In this book, we will adopt Clarkson’s definition of organisational stakeholders:  
An organisation's stakeholders are the people or groups of people that have, or 
claim ownership, rights, or interests in an organisation and its ac tivities, past, 
present and future. Such claimed rights or interests are the result of transactions 
with, or actions taken by the organisation, and may be legal or moral, individual 
or collective. Stakeholders with similar interests, claims, or rights can be classified 
as belonging to the same group, for example, shareholders, employees, customer 
and suppliers.3 
In general, stakeholders are classified as external or internal. External stakeholders are 
those individuals or groups, who do not work directly wi thin the organisation, but who are 
affected by the strategies, plans and actions of the organisation. External stakeholders 
include the community, government, activist groups and not -for- 
22 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
profit organisations, competitors, the media, industry associates, organised labour, 
customers, suppliers, analysts, consultants and researchers.  
Internal stakeholders are stakeholders who work directly within  an organi sation. 
Internal stakeholders are shareholders/business owners, investors, employees and 
management.  
Traditionally, the primary goal of organisations was to realise a profit and thereby 
satisfy the needs and expectations of its owners (or shareh olders). Contemporary 
organisations adopt the triple -bottom line - an accounting framework with three parts, 
comprising the social, environmental (ecological) and financial parts. By adopting this 
framework, organisations evaluate their performance on a br oader perspective to create 
greater business value. The triple -bottom line not only focuses on the expectation of 
shareholders (profit), but simultaneously on the expectations of all stakeholders. Therefore, 
to be regarded as successful, an organisation ne eds to be (i) profitable; (ii) take 
responsibility for the physical environment in which it operates; and (iii) meet its social 
responsibilities.  
Management on all hierarchical levels should acknowledge the important role that 
stakeholders play in organisa tions. Strategic managers, especially, must take into account 
the impact that the organisation's vision, goals, strategies, projects and plans have on all 
stakeholders. Organisations are responsible for considering and protecting the rights and 
expectation s of all their stakeholders.  
At the same time, the influence that stakeholders have on the organisation should 
also be considered. This calls for a stakeholder relationship management process, which 
will bear tangible and intangible long -term rewards for t he organisation. For example, new 
products, new markets, stronger supply chains, a diverse workforce, and trusting 
relationships will all yield a competitive advantage for the organisation.  
In our discussion so far, we have referred a number of times to th e term competitive 
advantage,  which is a key term in strategic management.  
LO 8:  Differentiate  between  the terms 'competitive advantage', 'sustainable  
competitive advantage' and ’transient competitive advantage'.  
1.8 Competitive advantage, sustainable competitive 
advantage and transient competitive advantage  
In Section 1.6, we elaborated on the management environment. The market environment 
was identified as the environment comprising customers, competitors, the labour market 
and labour unions, intermed iaries and suppliers. In this environment, competition is taking 
place - organisations are competing for the same customers, suppliers, skilled labour and 
intermediaries. The most widely used framework for classifying and analysing these forces 
of competit ion in a specific industry was developed by Michael Porter of Harvard Business 
School.4 His framework views the profitability or  
23 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
attractiveness of an industry as determined by five sources of competitive pressure in the 
particular industry. These five sources are (1) competition from providers of substitute, 
products and/or services; (2) competition from new entrants or potential competitors; (3) 
competition from established rivals ( competitors); (4) the power of suppliers; and (5) the 
power of buyers.  
1. Competition from substitutes is influenced and determined by the buyers’ propensity to 
substitute or buy substitute products and the relative prices and performance of 
substitutes.  
2. Comp etition from new entrants or potential competitors to the industry is influenced by 
various factors, such as the capital needed to enter the industry, product 
differentiation, and legal barriers to enter the industry.  
3. Competition from established rivals (c ompetitors) in the industry is influenced by 
factors such as the diversity of these rivals, product differentiation to be found in the 
industry, exit barriers and cost conditions.  
4. The power of suppliers is also determined by various factors, for example, t he price 
sensitivity of suppliers and their relative bargaining power.  
5. Lastly, the power of buyers is influenced by factors such as competition between 
buyers, product differentiation, the information made available to buyers and the size 
and concentration  of buyers relative to suppliers.  
Once an organisation understands how the structure of the industry in which it operates 
drives competition in this industry, the profitability of the industry can be forecasted for 
the future. Determining industry structur e involves the identification of the main players in 
the industry - the producers, customers, suppliers, and producers of substitute products. An 
examination of the key characteristics of each of the main players will determine the 
competition in the indus try and bargaining power that we described in the previous 
paragraph. This analysis can subsequently be used to forecast industry profitability. Why? 
Organisations will only invest capital and other resources in an industry that meets its 
objectives in ter ms of profitability. Once an organisation understands the structure of its 
industry and have made forecasts of its profitability, strategies can be developed.  
The next crucial question that needs to be answered is how industry profit is shared 
among the different organisations competing in a particular industry? To answer this 
question, it requires an identification of the sources of competitive advantage within the 
particular industiy. We can use the term ‘key success factors’ to describe the factors in an 
industry that influence an organisation’s ability to outperform its rivals or competitors. 
Once an organisation understands the drivers of industry profitability, it can identify 
strategies through which it can improve industry attractiveness and positi on itself relative 
to its competitive forces. In essence, this means that an organisation can earn superior 
financial performance either by (1) locating in an attractive industiy; or by (2) establishing 
a competitive advantage over its rivals. Of these two , competitive advantage is the most 
important since competition intensifies constantly across almost all industries so that very 
few 
24 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
industries can guarantee secure investment returns. Hence, we can conclude that the 
primary goal of a strategy is to establish a position of competitive advantage for the 
organisation. Stated differently, the primary goals of strategy is to put an organisation in a 
superior business position - which is a requirement for sustainability and survival over the 
long term.  
At this point, we need to provide a formal definition of the term ‘competitive 
advantage’. The literature provides us with numerous definitions, for exam ple: 
Competitive advantage is what makes you better than anyone else.5 
Competitive advantage are conditions that allow a company or country to 
produce a good or service at equal value but at a lower price or in a more 
desirable fashion. These conditions allow the productive entity to generate more 
sales or superior margins compared to its market rivals.6 
A superiority gained by an organization when it can provide the same value as its 
competitors but at a lower price, or can charge higher prices by provid ing greater 
value through differentiation. Competitive advantage results from matching core 
competencies to the opportunities?  
There is no one answer about what is competitive advantage or one way to 
measure it, and for the right reason. Nearly everything can be considered as 
competitive edge, eg higher profit margin, greater return on assets, valuable 
resource such as brand reputation or unique competence in producing jet 
engines. Every company must have at least one advantage to successfully 
compete in th e market. If a company can't identify one or just doesn't possess it, 
competitors soon outperform it and force the business to leave the market.8 
For the purposes of this chapter, we will define competitive advantage as follows:  
When two or more organisati ons compete within the same industry, one 
possesses a competitive advantage over its rivals when it performs (or has the 
potential to perform) better than its rivals.  
Common sources of competitive advantage are the following: barriers to entry, capital, cost 
advantage, customer satisfaction, digital maturity, distribution, know -how, market power, 
bargaining power, brand name, corporate governance, critical mass, design, distinctive 
capability, economic advantage, economies of scale, intellectual property,  sustainability, 
trade secrets, switching costs, market position, marketability, organisational culture, 
product development, risk management, technology and market position.  
Having a competitive advantage is the result of an organisation matching internal  
strengths to external key success factors. It is crucial to point out that competitive 
advantage is not something static and stable. In fact, competitive advantage is a 
disequilibrium phenomenon: it is created by change and, once established, it starts a 
competitive process that leads to its destruction.  
25 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
The changes that create competitive advantage, can be either internal or external. 
Internally, some organisations may, for example, have  a greater creative and innovative 
capability than their rivals that may lead to a competitive advantage. Externally, changes 
in, for example, customer demands or technology can create a competitive advantage for an 
organisation that is faster and more eff ective in exploiting change than its rivals.  
Once an organisation establishes competitive advantage, it is eroded by competition. 
The speed of this erosion will depend on the ability of competitors to challenge, either by 
imitation or by innovation. For a sustainable competitive advantage, the organisation must 
create barriers for other organisations to imitate and innovate its advantages. We therefore 
define a sustainable competitive advantage as:  
an organisation that has the ability to perform (or the pot ential to perform) better 
than its rivals over the long term.  
Organisations may have assets, attributes or abilities that are difficult to imitate or exceed 
which contribute to their competitive advantage. Competitive advantages are often short -
lived and i nstead of building one advantage and defending it, a transient strategy focuses on 
innovation strategies that continually build new advantages. Therefore, we define transient 
competitive advantage as follows:  
an organisation that has the ability to build u p temporary (or transient) 
advantages where they seize opportunities, exploit it, and then move quickly when 
they have exhausted the opportunity.  
Some of the competitive advantage of various South African companies are highlighted 
below.  
Practising strategy  
Woolworths  
Max Sonnenberg founded Woolworths in 1931. His belief that success lies in providing 
customers with superior quality merchandise at reasonable prices has been 
instrumental in establishing Woolworths as one of South Africa’s leading reta il chains - 
a benchmark for excellence and an icon of quality.9 
South African Breweries  
The South African Breweries Group, is one of the world’s largest beer distributors with 
a market share of 98 per cent in South Africa. The company is at the forefront i n 
addressing social inequities in its hiring, promoting, and training practices, and 
combating discrimination. The company's diverse workforce creates a global 
competitive advantage for the company.10 
26 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
Edcon  
Edgars Consolidated Stores, commonly known as Edcon, is one of the country's most 
successful retail operations. The company firmly believes in the power of outsourced 
information technolo gy for competitive advantage. From an information technology 
point of view, that means that the company thoroughly analyses available 
technologies and options for how these are delivered to the business. A key 
contributor to the success of the organisation ’s IT strategy has been its decision to 
outsource substantial components of its infrastructure, data processing, systems 
development, security and storage capabilities. Since there is a shortage of 
technology skills in the country, the company believes it simply does not make sense 
for Edcon to develop expertise in -house. Their core focus is retail, so they look for 
partners that are experts in the field of IT so that the company can focus on an 
understanding of business principles that apply to their marke t and leave the 
technology in the hands of appropriately skilled suppliers. The company's ability to 
appoint appropriate expertise to take care of specialist functions is critical to achieve 
and sustain growth.11 
The big picture  
In this chapter, we highlig hted the relationship between various general management 
principles and strategic management. The background and information provided lay the 
foundation for the successful practising of strategy, which is the focus of the remainder of 
the book. Strategists  need to have a thorough understanding of the crucial role that 
strategic management plays in any business organisation. Without strategic management, 
the organisation is doomed for failure, as we have seen in the LeisureNet case study. 
Furthermore, strate gists need to have a thorough understanding of the management 
environment in which it operates. Competition in this environment is becoming more 
fierce, due to various factors such as globalisation and the use of technology to conduct 
business, to mention only a few. Therefore, the establishment of strategies that will ensure 
the sustainability and long -term survival of the organisation is crucial. The study of 
strategic management focuses on how organisations achieve this competitive advantage, in 
other wo rds how they achieve superior performance and sustainability over the long term. 
In Chapter 2, we will introduce you to the practice of strategy.  
Summary of learning outcomes  
LO 1: Explain the concepts ’manager' and 'management'  
A manager as a person that is responsible for running a part of or an entire organisation. 
Management is defined as the process of working with and through others to achieve 
organisational objectives in a changing environment. To be successful, organisations need 
managers performing  the management process.  
27 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
LO 2: Explain the management process, indicating the four characteristics 
thereof.  
The four characteristics of management are:  
(i) management is a process, consisting  of four management functions namely 
planning, organising, leading and control;  
(ii) management entails working with and through others;  
(iii) management aims to contribute to the realisation of organisational goals and 
objectives, and in doing so management needs to  balance effectiveness and 
efficiency and makes the most of limited and scarce resources; and  
(iv) management needs to cope with a changing environment.  
LO 3: Differentiate between the various levels of management.  
We differentiate between the top, middle and lower levels of management. Top managers 
are responsible for strategic planning, implementation and control for the organisation as a 
whole. Middle managers are responsible for specific departments or functions of the 
organisation.  
Lower -level managers are  responsible for even smaller segments of the organisation 
namely the various subsections.  
LO 4: Explain the various areas of management.  
Seven areas of management are distinguished, namely finance, operations, procurement, 
marketing, human resources, public relations and research and development.  
LO 5: Explain the hierarchy of organisational plans and depict it 
diagrammatically.  
The hierarchy of organisational plans consists of strategic, tactical, operational and 
individual plans. The strategic plan c omprises seven elements, namely the vision, mission, 
SWOT analysis, core values, objectives and strategies of the organisation. Tactical plans 
focus on the functional areas of the organisation, whereas operational plans focus on 
subsections of the organisa tion, which may be single -use plans or standing plans. 
Individual plans are the translation of broader organisational plans into plans for the 
individual worker.  
LO 6: Explain the composition of the management environment.  
Structurally, the management envi ronment can be divided into the micro -, market and 
remote environments. The micro -environment is the organisation itself over which 
management has control. It includes organisational functions, policies, strategies, goals, 
objectives, and resources. The ma rket environment is also referred to as the competitive 
environment and consists of customers, suppliers, labour and labour unions, and 
competitors.  CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
LO 7: Explain the terms 'stakeholder' and 'stakeholder relationship 
management'.  
An organisation’s stakeholders are the person or groups of people that have, or claim to 
have ownership, rights, or interests in an organisation and its activities,  past, present and 
future. Organisations need to manage its relationship with all stakeholders.  
LO 8: Differentiate between the terms 'competitive advantage’, 'sustainable 
competitive advantage' and 'transient competitive advantage'.  
When two or more organ isations compete within the same industry, one possesses a 
competitive advantage over its rivals when it performs (or has the potential to perform) 
better than its rivals. Sustainable competitive advantage refers to an organisation that has 
the ability to perform (or the potential to perform) better than its rivals over the long term. 
Organisations may have assets, attributes or abilities that are difficult to duplicate or 
exceed to lead to its competitive advantage. Competitive advantages are often short -lived 
and instead of building one advantage and defending it, a transient strategy focuses on 
innovation strategies that continually build new advantages. Organisations need to build up 
temporary or transient advantages where it seizes opportunities, exploi t it, and then move 
quickly when it has exhausted the opportunity.  
Discussion questions  
1. Provide an explanation of the terms ‘manager’ and ‘management’. Is there a difference 
between contemporaiy views of these terms, compared to more traditional views?  
2. Explain the management process and highlight the most significant components of the 
process.  
3. Discuss the various levels and areas of management and highlight the most important 
responsibilities of each level and area of management.  
4. Explain the composition of the management environment and indicate the importance 
thereof in terms of strategic management.  
5. Explain the hierarchy of organisational plans and highlight the most important plans 
pertaining to each level of the hierarchy.  
6. Explain the term ‘stakeholder’ and defend the importance of stakeholder relationship 
management in organisations, as well as the important role that strategists play in this.  
7. Differentiate between competitive advantage, sustainable competitive advantage and 
transient compe titive advantage. Also, highlight the importance of these concepts in 
strategic management.

Strategy  
Organisations generally have an imperative to survive and to perform 
above the average - as we have indicated in Chapter 1. The study of 
strategic management focuses on how organisations achieve this 
competitive advantage, in other words, how they achieve superior 
performance and sustainability over the long term. However, as the 
case study on Elon Musk suggests, the role of people in influencing 
strategy in the organisation cannot be underestimated.  
In this chapter, we review the origins of strategic management, 
identify and explain the universal principles of strategic management, 
define strategy, explain how the success of strategy can be measured,  
and describe a contemporary strategic management framework.  Case study  
Elon Musk - Leading with Vision  
In 2006, Elon Musk announced in a blog his 'master plan' for sustainable mass transport. This 
entailed:  
¦ creating a low -volume1 car, which would necessarily be expensive.  
¦ using  that money to develop a medium -volume car at a lower  price.  
¦ using  that money to create an affordable, high -volume car.  
¦ providing solar power.  
As one of the most admired technology entrepreneurs in the world, South African -born Musk 
is known for his vision to rid the world of fossil fuels, and Tesla's electric vehicles and solar 
power technologies are ways of doing just that. Musk's plan unfolded over the last decade or 
so first with the development of t he Tesla S, an expensive, high -performing sports car, and then  moving into the second phase of the plan with the  development  of 
the Tesla  X and  Tesla Roadster. 
Most recently, Tesla announced the Tesla  3, an affordable  
electric car, and with advance orders of more than 400,000 cars, it would seem as if the 
master plan is on track. In the meantime, Tesla also launched various products for residential 
and business solar energy production, such as the Powerwall battery system, solar panels and 
a ‘solar roof, an d their SolarCity business is now the second -largest solar provider in the US. 
In support of his businesses, Tesla built a Gigafactory (with Panasonic) for producing lithium -
ion batteries for use in battery farms and electric cars.  
When pursuing of his vis ion for a sustainable planet, Musk does not hesitate in 
sharing his ideas and technologies freely and in thinking out of the box. He made Tesla 
Motors' patents available to the industry for free, and has explicitly open -sourced the 
Hyperloop2 train concept  so that others can take the ideas and further develop them. 
In addition, he is striving to make travel to Mars affordable with Space -X and to 
establish a space colony on Mars.  
Musk is often described as a transformational leader who has the following qualities:  
¦ The capacity to think beyond what seems possible or viable today.  
¦ The ability to make people believe in his vision, no matter how far -fetched it may 
seem.  
¦ Leading by example - excellence is non -negotiable.  
¦ A relentless (even obsessive) drive towards results - failure is not an option.  
However, leaders like Musk are not always easy to work with. The amazing vision and drive 
that contribute to Musk's leadership style sometimes mean that 'an engineer might spend 
nine months working 100 hours a we ek on something because Musk pushed him to, and 
then out of nowhere, Musk will change his mind and scrap the project'.  
32 CHAPTER 2: INTRODUCING THE PRACTICE OF STRATEGY  
In 2016, Musk updated his master plan to:  
1. Create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage.  
2. Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major [consumer] segments.  
3. Develop a self -driving capability that is 10X safer than manual capability via 
massive fleet learning.  
4. Enable your car to m ake money for you when you aren't using it.  
With his  track record up to this point, it would unwise to bet against him achieving  
exactly what he sets out to do.

LO 1:  Explain  the origins  of strategic  management.  
2.1 The origins of strategic management  
While strategy  is an ancient concept,3 strategic management, as we know it today, 
originated in the late 1970s following a move away from corporate planning to a more 
externally focused process. Strategic management was characterised by a focus on 
competition as the key  driving force in the business environment and profit maximisation 
as the primary goal of the organisation. The process of strategic management accordingly 
focused on the selection of markets and on the positioning of the organisation in its chosen 
markets  relative to its competitors as a source of competitive advantage (ie superior 
performance over the long term). Initially, the focus of strategic management was to 
determine how the organisation could tap into sources of profit in an industry by virtue of 
its industry positioning. For example, by creating clear differentiation from its 
competitors, organisations could be in a position to charge higher prices for the perceived 
higher quality. This view, with Michael Porter4 as its main proponent (which we di scussed 
in Chapter 1, Section 1.8), was predominant until the 1990s and is still prominent in 
strategy texts to this day.  
In the 1990s, the resource -based view (RBV) emerged as the dominant perspective on 
how organisations could achieve a competitive advantage. In accordance with the RBV, an 
organisation’s internal resources and capabilities were the most important sources of profit 
and competitive advantage. The focus of strategic management accordingly shifted to 
understanding how organisations diffe red from their competitors (in terms of what 
capabilities they possessed) and how these differences could be leveraged for competitive 
advantage.5 
Our understanding of how organisations practise strategic management and how they 
develop competitive advanta ge and organisational sustainability (the ability of the 
organisation to survive and outperform rivals in the long run) is shaped by our  
33 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
environment (which we discussed in Chapter 1, Sect ion 1.6} and is constantly evolving. 
For example, in the aftermath of a string of corporate scandals internationally, as well as 
locally (such as Enron, Fidentia and the Steinhoff scandal), the global financial crisis of 
2008 and 2009, and the current stat e of governance in South Africa (such as the widely 
publicised problems in many state -owned companies like Eskom, South African Airways 
(SAA) and the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), there is a strong focus on 
responsible and ethical corporat e behaviour (which we referred to in Chapter 1 as the 
‘triple -bottom line’).  
In this book, we emphasise the importance of the environment, and the resources and 
capabilities of the organisation. At the same time, we recognise that strategic management 
is a dynamic discipline and that its key influences and debates change over time. However, 
while our understanding of the focus of strategic management and competitive advantage 
has evolved, the strategic management process itself has not always enjoyed the sa me 
attention. In this book, we argue that the strategic management process is also a fluid and 
changing concept. While there are many different views on how strategic management 
should be done, there are certain common principles that underlie the various views of 
strategy and strategic management. In the next section, we review these common principles.  
LO 2:  Identify and explain the universal principles of strategic management.  
2.2 The universal principles of strategic 
management  
Most lecturers involved in teaching strategic management have experienced a situation in 
which students complain that the way strategic management is taught is different from the 
way it actually happens in their organisations. This could be seen as a sign of the 
theory/practice divi de, and as reflective of the complexity of strategic management. More 
recently, the study of strategic management started to catch up to the practice of strategic 
management. Despite this complexity, there are some principles that are common to all 
views o f strategic management, and we discuss these principles below, by using the 
example of Discovery Bank as it illustrates the application of these principles.  
34  
CHAPTER 2: INTRODUCING THE PRACTICE OF STRATEGY  
Practising strategy  
Discovery moves into retail banking6 
Discovery is a large, listed, financial services institution operating through Discovery 
Health (DH), Discovery Life (DL), Discovery Invest (Dl), short -term insurer Discovery 
Insure, and the very popular and successful Discovery Vitality (a wellness loyalty 
programme). In addition, it has operations in the USA, where it licenses Vitality for use 
by employers and other health insurers, and in the UK, where it operated two joint 
ventures (JVs) with the Prudential pic - PruHealth and Prulife. Its core purpose is ‘to 
make people healthier, and enhance and protect their lives'. Discovery is generally 
known for its innovativeness. For example, they are credited with the invention of the 
medical savings plan used widely by medic al schemes today.  
In 2015, Discovery received authorisation from the Registrar of Banks to 
establish banking operations in South Africa, and launched its banking products in 
2019. This is according to Discovery CEO Adrian Gore, who said they are deep into the 
preparation phase of the new bank. Gore said it is a complicated process to assemble 
the right team, build the systems to support the bank, and develop products which 
banking clients need. Despite the complications, he remains upbeat about the 
prospect s of Discovery Bank - saying it is an exciting project.  
’We need to meet the needs of our customers. I think we can. We have strong 
ideas and convictions about that. If we can do that, the market will tell us,' said Gore.  
Gore said they had tremendous succ ess with their joint venture with FNB on the 
Discovery Card, which provides them with a launchpad for full banking services.  
'We've got the capital, we've hired bankers, we're building substantial systems. 
We want to make an offering that's relevant and ca n win market share,' said Gore.  
Discovery has an advantage over the big four traditional banks, as it does not 
have to maintain a country -wide network of branches and ATMs. This means Discovery 
Bank's costs will be lower than its competitors.  
2.2.1  Principle 1: Strategy is about positive change  
Strategic management is ultimately about positive change for the organisation as a whole. 
Positive change includes achieving superior performance, creating competitive advantage, 
creating shareholder wealth above the avera ge, meeting the needs of all stakeholders (you 
may refer back to Chapter 1, Section 1.5 where we differentiated between shareholders and 
stakeholders), or, in some instances, just surviving in difficult times. It is also worth 
noting that it is about chang e, and managing such change, and not about just doing things 
as they have always been done (ie 'business as usual’). For example, the decision by 
Discoveiy to launch Discovery Bank7 reflects Discovery’s view that they will be able to 
use their expertise in  the financial services industry and their loyal customer base to 
compete successfully in the retail banking industry and to create value for the owners of 
the group.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
2.2.2  Principle 2: Strategy t akes a long -term view  
Strategy is about taking a long -term view and ultimately focusing on wealth creation and 
sustainability over the long term, rather than on merely creating quick wins or short -term 
gains.  
2.2.3  Principle 3: Strategy is complex  
Strategy is highly complex and is associated with high levels of uncertainty and risk. There 
are no easy answers, no recipes for success, and it is highly situated, meaning that it is 
different for every context. In other words, strategic management is about making bi g 
decisions during situations of high uncertainty and having to consider many different 
variables. Should strategic decisions fail, there may be very severe negative consequences 
for the organisation, so the risk is enormous. Discovery worked for some year s on 
establishing Discovery Bank, and invested a lot of time and money into getting the 
necessary approvals and license, appointing the right personnel and establishing 
infrastructure. Should the bank not perform as envisaged, it could mean that this capit al 
investment was not justified, and Discovery could end up losing a great deal of money.  
2.2.4  Principle 4: Strategy has an internal and external 
focus  
Strategy is about mobilising resources and capabilities inside the organisation to pursue 
opportunities outsi de of the organisation, or to respond to negative risks timeously. This 
typically means that strategic decision -makers have to understand the resources and 
capabilities of the organisation, and how it needs to change over time to keep up with a 
changing an d unpredictable external environment. In the case of Discovery Bank, the board 
of Discovery felt that their internal resources and capabilities (such as their loyal customer 
base, their Vitality loyalty programme, innovation capabilities and their experien ce in the 
insurance industry) would enable them to pursue the perceived external opportunity in the 
retail banking industry.  
2.2.5  Principle 5: Strategy is both deliberate and emergent  
Organisations have very important formal processes to create deliberate strategies. 
Deliberate strategies are those strategies that the organisation intends to pursue in order to 
achieve its long -term goals. Hence, we often consider strategy as something abstract, as 
something that an organisation possesses, for example, ‘the strategy of company X is cost 
leadership’. However, there is increasing recognition that strategising is also a human 
activity, something that people do in organisations every day. The acts and decisions of 
strategists may lead to an ‘emergent’ strategy th at is different from what the organisation 
intended. Robert Grant suggests that strategy exists in three places: the heads of managers, 
in the talk and documents they produce,  
36 CHAPTER 2: INTRODUCING THE PRACTICE OF STRATEGY  
and in thei r actions. Only the latter two are observable.8 This perspective implies that, if 
we are to understand strategy and strategic management, we have to understand who the 
strategists are, and how and why they make decisions and do what they do rather than 
focusing only on strategy at an abstract level. In fact, the realised strategy may often end 
up being quite different from the intended strategy. People do not act like rational robots, 
but that their strategic acts (and, by implication, strategy) are fuelled  by who and what they 
are, as well as by cognition (rationality) and politics, the quest for power. In the opening 
case study, it is clear that Elon Musk’s way of doing things plays a considerable role in the 
success of Tesla.  
While top managers undoubtedl y play a key role in the success of strategic 
management, the emerging strategy perspective suggests that top managers alone are not 
the only strategists. Any individual or group in the organisation that controls key or 
precedent -setting actions9 can be re garded as a strategist. Accordingly, we can extend our 
perspective of strategists to include non -executive directors, strategic planners, middle 
managers and consultants. Through their own interpretations of strategy, or their own 
actions, these role playe rs can influence the allocation of resources. It is, therefore, 
important to consider their role. Certain methodologies and systems can also be used to 
facilitate strategising, for example, strategy workshops and projects.  
2.2.6  Principle 6: Strategy involves various different 
thought processes  
The process perspectives of strategy often present it as orderly, analytical, rational and 
neat, and also as deliberate - a path that is chosen and pursued efficiently. In fact, there is 
much evidence to the contrary. St rategy is often emergent rather than deliberate, messy 
rather than neat, and experimental and fraught with failure rather than efficient and 
effective from the start. So, while there are elements of the strategy process that are 
designed to be rational and  cognitive (eg conducting strategy workshops), there are a 
myriad of social interactions inside and outside of the workplace that influence the 
activities and decisions of strategists. There are different thought processes at work in 
strategic management. In fact, strategy is often referred to as both an art and a science, 
suggesting that it incorporates both a rational, analytical element, as well as an element of 
creativity. In addition, there are often power issues at work in strategy, where individuals 
or groups compete for power. As alluded to earlier, strategy work is about verbal and 
written communication. Strategists need to be able to use persuasive language and 
arguments, and be able to build a coherent story of strategy from the snippets of 
conver sation taking place all over the organisation.10 In addition, documents such as 
strategic plans, operational plans and strategy presentations are important forms of 
discourse that can influence the strategy and strategic decision -making.  
Since the term ‘st rategic thinking’ is used so often, it is useful to consider what it 
means. Figure 2.1 is a comparison of some characteristics of strategic thinking with non -
strategic thinking. Strategic thinking is typically focused on the future and represents a 
certain  willingness to take calculated risks. Strategic thinkers are also generally more 
creative, flexible and pro -active than non -strategic thinkers.

Figure 2.1 Strategic versus non -strategic thinking  
2.2.7  Principle 7: Strategy happens at different hierarchical 
levels  
In large multi -business organisations, strategic management and decision -making takes 
place at different levels. Table 2.1 compares strategic management and decision -making on 
corporate, business and functional levels of an organisation in terms of (1) where the 
decision -making takes place, (2) the scope of the decision, (3) the responsible people, and 
(4) the goals thereo f. At the highest level, decisions about the growth path of the 
organisation are made by the board of directors or other governing bodies. This level of 
strategy is known as corporate -level strategy and the focus is on creating stakeholder value. 
It is at this level that decisions are made about the scope of the organisation, for example, 
mergers, acquisitions, divestments and globalisation. The decision by Discovery to enter 
the banking industry is an example of a corporate strategic decision.  
Business -level strategy takes place at the level of the single business or business 
unit (eg a subsidiary) and the goal is for it to achieve competitive advantage within the 
markets in which it is competing. It supports corporate -level strategy by ensuring  that it is 
successful in its markets, and draws on the corporate centre to provide it with the means to 
compete successfully. Business unit managers are responsible for attaining the overall goal 
of the organisation. In the case of Discovery Bank, the com pany will hope that with access 
to their existing customer base, corporate capabilities and Discovery’s Vitality loyalty 
programme, it will be able to compete successfully in the banking industry.  
Functional strategies, such as human resource or marketing strategies, are developed 
by functional managers to execute the business unit strategies developed by business unit 
managers, and to support the implementation of business strategies. For example, in setting 
up Discovery Bank, the human resource strategy i n hiring the right talent to staff the bank 
is going to be crucial to its success.

Bidvest provides us with an example of the different levels of strategy that can be found in 
multi -business organisations.  
Practising strategy: Bidvest's 
corporate strategy11 
Bidvest is a South African corporation that focuses on using diversification and 
innovation to grow their portfolio of successful, cash -generating businesses in consumer 
and industrial products, electrica l products, financial services, freight management, 
office and print solutions, outsourced hard and soft services, travel and aviation services 
and automotive retailing.  
The company uses acquisitions to invest in a blend of defensive, cyclical and 
growth assets; they prefer businesses that generate cash and are not heavily invested in 
assets, and are aiming to internationalise in certain niche markets in services and 
commercial products.  
The company is aiming to establish dominant positions in each of the markets 
they operate in with broad product offerings. Bidvest prides itself on having a highly 
entrepreneurial and decentralised management and operations, and a strong record of 
efficient capital allocation to the businesses they own.  
In contrast to the B idvest head office, where corporate strategies are identified 
and decisions are made in terms of the scope of the organisation, the role of Bidvest 
businesses is to ensure that they compete successfully in their industries. Bidvest's 
business goal is to ac hieve competitive advantage in its various markets. Within each 
business unit, functional managers need to execute business unit strategies so that they 
can compete successfully in its market. For example, Bidvest Car Rental must have 
business level strate gies and functional strategies to ensure that they compete 
successfully against other car rental companies.

LO 3:  Define  strategy  and explain  its importance  to the organisation.  
2.3 Defining strategy  
In this section, we consider some key aspects and describe what we mean by strategy, as 
seen from our perspective.  
2.3.1  What does it mean to be 'strategic?  
Not all actions and decisions in an organisation can be considered ‘strategic’.  
Strategic goal 
C 
 
Figure 2.2 Strategy versus business as usual12 
Consider Figure 2.2. If we take point A as where we are today, and we carry on doing what 
we are doing (ie business as usual) and we are somewhat lucky, we may end up at point B, 
in a slightly better position than we are today and perhaps, if we are very lucky, in a 
position where we are better off than our competitors. It is also quite po ssible that we will 
end up in exactly the same or even in a worse position than where we are today. However, 
we can set ourselves a long -term strategic goal (point C) that, if achieved, will take us 
considerably beyond where we are today and possibly even beyond our competitors - in 
other words, it will give us a competitive advantage that will lead to long -term survival. 
The difference between point B and point C is ‘strategy’; those actions that will help us 
achieve our strategic goals. Strategic goals ar e also known as long -term or strategic 
objectives. Being ‘strategic’ thus involves the following:  
¦ It is not ‘business as usual’ - we cannot simply keep doing what we have been 
doing for years and years and describe it as ‘strategic’.  
¦ It reaches across all business functions, that is, it is an organisation -wide issue, 
and across all managerial levels.  
¦ It is not a quick fix or a small change. It requires a large, sustained change effort 
over a long period of time.  
¦ It requires a large commitment of resources - it is not cheap or easy.  
40 CHAPTER 2: INTRODUCING THE PRACTICE OF STRATEGY  
¦ While it may not be the domain of top management only, and it may be 
influenced by many other people, top management is ultimately responsible for 
achieving strategic goals (or for failing to achieve them) as we indicated in 
Chapter 1, Section 1.3.  
2.3.2  The importance of strategy  
Strategy is a coherent story about the future direction of the organisation. It provides 
members of the organisation with a framework to guide decision -making processes.  
The strategic management process should combine the views and thinking of many 
members of the organisation and communicates the outcome back to the organisation so 
that everyone follows the same strategy.  
Strategy is, in a sense, the verbalisation of the organisation’s aspirations and 
accordingly provides an inspirational element that may be far removed from the realities of 
the present. In this sense, a good strategy can inspire, unite and motivate members of the 
organisati on. 
2.3.3  Defining strategy  
Strategy has been described variously as the long -term direction of the organisation, a 
pattern in a stream of decisions,13 the means by which organisations achieve their 
objectives and the deliberate choice of a set of activities to achieve competitive 
advantage.14 These definitions make provision for both deliberate choices and for 
unplanned and emerging strategies. However,  if we accept the idea that strategy is a 
conversation, we can imagine that strategy is shaped by ongoing discussions about the 
future of the organisation, and that strategy may simply be a believable story about the 
future of the organisation. What all of  these definitions have in common is the notion of a 
direction for the future, whether it is a ‘pattern’ that can be recognised from the activities 
and decisions of the organisation, a deliberate choice of a set of activities, or the steps 
taken to achieve  strategic goals.  
Building on these definitions, and accepting that strategy is primarily a human 
activity, we define strategy in this book as the direction provided by the actions and decisions 
of strategists in pursuit of organisational goals.  
2.3.4  Defining s trategic management  
Traditionally, strategic management has been defined as setting strategic direction, setting 
goals, crafting a strategy, implementing and executing the strategy, and then over time and 
through a controlling process, initiating whatever corrective adjustments and corrections 
are deemed appropriate. However, more recent views have suggested that strategy is not 
this sequential and discrete, but is somewhat messier, overlapping and iterative. 
Independent of the process followed to develop and manage strategy, the purpose of 
strategic management is to ensure that the organisation applies the following four key 
elements:  
41 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
1. Clear and consistent long -term strategic direction in terms of what the organisation 
wants to achieve in the future.  
2. A profound understanding of the external environment to ensure that the 
organisation is able to align itself with opportunities and to deal with threats as 
effectively as possible.  
3. An objective  knowledge of the key resources and capabilities the organisation 
possesses, as well as its value to enable the organisation to build on these and 
develop a distinct competitive advantage.  
4. The proper alignment of organisational structure, systems, culture,  and functional 
and operational management (collectively referred to as organisational 
architecture) to ensure the effective implementation of strategic plans, portfolios, 
programmes, projects and initiatives.  
Strategic management is ultimately about consi stently aligning the organisation with its 
internal and external environments, as shown in Figure 2.3. In this figure, strategic direction  
refers to the long -term goals of the organisation which can be expressed as, for example, 
vision and mission statements. It relates to the key elements against which all strategic 
decisions should be measured.  
¦ External consistency refers to the extent to which the organisation’s strategy is aligned 
with the opportunities and threats in the external environment (refer to the components 
of the external environment explained in Chapter 1, Section 1.6). Significant changes 
in the external environment will most  likely require some changes in strategy.  
¦ Dynamic consistency measures the extent to which the strategy of the organisation is 
consistent with the key resources and capabilities of the organisation in its micro -
environment (refer to the components of the i nternal environment explained in Chapter 
1, Section 1.6). In other words, is the organisation making the best possible use of its 
resources and capabilities to benefit from opportunities and to avoid having to deal 
with threats.  
¦ Internal consistency addres ses the extent to which the organisational architecture (such 
as structure, systems, human resources, technology and processes) are aligned with the 
strategy. It also considers whether planning at lower levels of management in the 
organisation is broadly a ligned with strategy. In this view of strategic management, 
strategising can be seen as the efforts of strategists to ensure consistency on all three 
levels of management and within the boundaries of the strategic goals of the 
organisation. Strategising wi ll require strategic decisions to be made, and this is the 
focus of the next section.  
42 CHAPTER 2: INTRODUCING THE PRACTICE OF STRATEGY  
 
Figure 2.3 Successful strategic management: striving for consistency  
LO 4:  Identify  the characteristics  of strategic  decision -making,  and provide guidelines  
to strategic decision -makers to aid them in making better strategic decisions.  
2.4 Strategic decisions  
Strategic decisions that strategists need to make are influenced by two factors, cognitive 
and rational aspects, as well as political processes. These are explained below.  
¦ Cognitive and rational aspects. The term ‘cognitive f unctioning’ refers to an 
individual’s ability to perform various mental activities associated with learning, 
problem -solving and decision -making. Strategists, as important problem -solvers and 
decision -makers in an organisation, should adopt a logical appro ach and try to be as 
objective as possible when they are solving problems and making decisions. When 
making decisions, strategists could consider two primary decision -making models, 
namely the rational and the bounded -rationality model. In the case of the rational 
model, the strategist should select the best possible solution to the problem - known as 
optimising. However, while the rational view is strongly emphasised in the prevailing 
views of strategy, it has been recognised that managers are generally re stricted by 
their own information - processing capabilities, which brings us to the second decision -
making model, namely ‘bounded rationality’. This refers to a situation in which 
strategists use satisficing and select the first possible solution to a probl em that meets 
the minimal criteria. Strategists should know which model to use and when. They 
should optimise - apply the rational model - when making high -risk decisions in 
conditions of uncertainty. When they are making low -risk decisions, they should 
select the first option that meets the minimal criteria.14 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
¦ Political processes. Strategists will not necessarily agree on the best course of action 
to achieve strategic goals and may use their  sphere of power and influence or 
persuasive (or dissuasive) language to sway others towards their preference. This is 
known as political behaviour in organisations. Strategists are ultimately, like all 
human beings, social and political beings, influenced  by their backgrounds (eg 
education, culture and religion) and personalities in their quest for status and power. It 
is, therefore, almost impossible to expect strategic decisions to be entirely objective 
and rational.  
In environments where fast strategic decision -making is required, the following guidelines 
can aid strategists in their decision -making processes:15 
¦ Developing more than one alternative course of action or solution to a problem. 
This will help minimise the influence of politicking. Strategy s imulations can be 
used to improve the strategists’ abilities to generate and evaluate alternatives 
more quickly.  
¦ Getting real -time information. Instead of waiting for formal reports, fast decision 
makers obtain the information they need from operational da ta and by informal 
discussions with other managers and members of the organisation.  
¦ Relying on experience and trusted advisers. This entails not depending on junior 
managers and consultants for analyses, but developing a network of trusted and 
proven advis ors. 
¦ Trying to reach consensus, but not at all costs. There will be occasions when there 
is simply not enough time to establish consensus, and the majority should, at 
some point, make a decision.  
In strategic decision -making, it is sometimes important to remember that it is ‘better to be 
vaguely right than exactly wrong’,16 meaning that the time and cost associated with more 
accurate information will not always be of equal benefit in the decision making process. In 
the next section, we will consider the qu estion of how the success of strategy can be 
measured.  
LO 5:  Explain  how the success  of strategy  can be measured.  
2.5 How do we measure the success of strategy?  
Competitive advantage and sustainability are often mentioned in the same context. 
However, the meas ure of strategic success is not always a simple matter. On the one hand, 
there are proponents of shareholder capitalism, who suggest that the creation of shareholder 
wealth through profitability is and should remain the only measure of strategic success. 
However, shareholder capitalism and the drive for ‘profit at all cost’ were heavily 
implicated as a leading cause of the 2008 -2009 global economic crisis, with detractors 
suggesting that an excessive focus on profits (and especially short term profits) was not 
sustainable.  
44 CHAPTER 2: INTRODUCING THE PRACTICE OF STRATEGY  
On the other hand, the stakeholder approach  (explained in Chapter 1, Section 1.7) requires a 
focus on balancing the often -conflicting needs of multiple stakeholders such as employees, 
shareholders, the environment and local communities. While we increasingly see large 
corporations embracing the con cept and reporting, not only on their financial results, but 
also on their social and environmental contributions (so - called ‘triple -bottom line’ 
reporting), the stakeholder approach is criticised for vastly increasing the complexity of 
strategic decision -making and diluting the strategic goals of the organisation.  
Michael Jensen proposes that the two approaches should meet somewhere in the 
middle, and that ultimately enlightened shareholder value maximisation is exactly the same 
as enlightened stakeholder  theory.17 
LO 6:  Discuss  a contemporary strategic management framework.  
2.6 A contemporary strategic management 
framework  
Although we acknowledge the contribution of traditional strategic management 
perspectives to our understanding of this important field, we  also acknowledge that we 
need to incorporate newer thinking in our perspective of strategic management. To this 
end, we have devised the contemporary framework of strategic management (Figure 2.4) 
which serves as the framework for this book. This model, a nd the outline of the book are 
discussed in more detail below.  
In Section 2.2, we identified various universal principles of strategic manage ment. 
One of these principles was that strategy is both deliberate and emergent (as indicated in 
Section 2.2.5). F rom a deliberate strategy perspective, strategy drives organisational 
architecture and it is the job of managers responsible for implementing strategy to ensure 
that the elements of organisational architecture (such as structure and culture) are aligned 
with the chosen strategy. From an emergent strategy perspective, we argue that 
organisational architecture is so influential that it affects strategy formation profoundly. In 
our view, there is constant tension between strategy formation and organisational 
architecture, and this is depicted in Figure 2.4. We can think of this as a tug of war 
between strategy formation and organisational architecture. Sometimes, the strategy 
formation process is going to dominate and the architecture is going to follow. For 
example, Discovery’s decision to invest in retail banking, requires them to make the 
necessary changes to ensure that their organisational architecture is aligned with the new 
direction of the organisation. At other times, the organisational architecture mig ht lead and 
the strategy might follow. In the case of the South African Post Office, for example (see 
the practising strategy box below), we could argue that their existing national branch 
infrastructure, capabilities, and especially the tenacious efforts of CEO Mark Barnes, have 
a lot more 10 with their bid to take on the Sassa business that it being a deliberate 
predetermined strategy.  
45  
PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Practising strategy: Sassa and Post Office 
secure social grants deal'8 
The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) and the South African Post Office 
(Sapo) have reached a 'landmark' agreement to ensure social grant beneficiaries 
continue to receive their payments after Sassa’s contract with Ca sh Paymaster Services 
(CPS) ends on 31 March 2018, Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe announced on 
Sunday morning.  
In a setback to the ambitions of Sapo CEO Mark Barnes, who had hoped Sapo's 
Postbank would be the sole service provider, it is to be just  one of four payment 
channels available to social grant recipients. The hybrid model the parties agreed to 
will also enable beneficiaries to receive their monthly payments via bank accounts at 
commercial banks, merchants in large retail shops, and a 'secon d tier’ of merchants 
that includes village banks, general dealers, small retail outlets, and spaza shops. The 
hybrid model will be phased in over five years.  
Sapo would provide cash disbursements through its branch network, 
particularly in locations close enough to replace existing cash pay points, he said. At 
present 2.9 million, a little less than a third (29%) of all grant beneficiaries, receive cash 
payments.  
2.6.1  Strategy formation  
In this book, we use the term strategy formation deliberately. Most textbooks refer to the 
formal process of developing a strategy as strategy formulation. However, as we take both 
the formal and informal elements of strategy development into account, strategy formation 
is a more accurate term. Strategy formation consists of three elements, namely, process, 
context and content.  
¦ Process. In the first place, there are a number of processes that can be both formal and 
informal, involved in the development of develop strategy. They relate to the question 
‘how’ strategy develops  in the organisation, and is the focus of Chapter  
3. We also examine strategists and strategising in more detail in this section (and 
Chapter 4), as the practices and communication of strategists at all levels 
(‘strategising’) influence how strategy is formed . Strategising can contribute towards 
both strategy formation and the shaping of organisational architecture. For example, 
middle managers, in their interactions with customers, may realise that there is an 
opportunity to expand the product range of the or ganisation and canvas top managers 
to affect it. Or, regional managers may realise that there is a problem with the 
structure of the organisation and how it supports the strategy, and may influence role -
players to make the required changes.  CHAPTER 2: INTRODUCING THE PRACTICE OF STRATEGY  
¦ Context. Strategy is always context -bound. In other words, it takes place in a certain 
internal and external context, and this provides us with the ‘why’ of strategy. For 
example, a busines s in Botswana has to contend with the global context, the 
continental context, regional issues, country issues, the industry it is competing in, 
and with what is happening within the organisation. This external context and the 
risks it present will be expl ored in more depth in Chapter 5, while the internal context 
and the strategic resources and capabilities of the organisation will be the focus of 
Chapter 6.  
¦ Content. The content of strategy refers to the actual development of strategies (the 
‘what’, in other words) to compete in industries and to create shareholder value, and 
we will examine this aspect in more depth in Chapter 7.  
2.6.2  Strategy implementation  
Strategy implementation consists of three important elements, namely change management, 
organisationa l learning, and resource allocation.  
¦ Change management. The alignment of organisational architecture with strategy 
formation does not happen naturally, and the organisation has to put in place formal 
processes to manage the large -scale change associated wi th strategy. This aspect is 
explored in Chapter 8.  
¦ Organisational learning. This relates to the less formal processes of organisational 
learning to recognise and respond to the need for change is discussed in Chapter 9.  
¦ Resource allocation. The allocation of resources to portfolio, programmes, projects 
and organisational structures responsible for giving effect to strategy is the topic of 
Chapter 10.  
2.6.3  Strategic control  
Continuous environmental scanning (both formal and informal) helps to ensure monitoring 
and control processes. On the one hand, environmental scanning' and control need to 
ensure that the planned strategy is on track and to alert key decision makers if interventions 
are required. This is represented by the arrow from left to right. On the other  hand, leaders, 
strategists and other role -players in the organisation (eg market intelligence experts) may 
pick up signals from the environment that could affect the strategy formation process. This 
is represented by the arrow from right to left. This asp ect is examined in more depth in 
Chapter 14.  
2.6.4  Organisational architecture  
Organisational architecture is a management tool that is used to describe the workings of 
an organisation, especially with regard to the alignment of strategy and the organisation.19 
It is a model of the organisation that can be shared by everyone involved in managing 
change and aligning strategy with structure. There are many  
47  
PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
different perspectives on organisational architecture and what it comprises, but for 
purposes of this book, we have focused on the four main elements, namely culture, 
leadership and governance, structure, and resources and capabilities.  
¦ Culture. Peter Drucker once said that ‘culture eats strategy for breakfast’.20 This 
observation suggests that culture is so powerful that no plan will work if it is counter 
to the culture of the organisation. In Chapter 11, we focus on organisational culture 
and its vital role in aligning stra tegy and organisational architecture.  
¦ Leadership and governance. Chapter 12 deals with the closely related issue of 
leadership and its role in strategy implementation and governance.  
¦ Structure. The structure of the organisation refers to the physical manif estation of the 
organisation in terms of geographical distribution, positions, reporting and 
communication lines, and so on. The role of structure in the alignment of structure and 
strategy is the topic of Chapter 13.  
Resources and capabilities  
The success  of organisations is dependent on them possessing unique strategic resources 
and valuable capabilities that form the foundation upon which the organisations are built 
and can grow. The role of resources and capabilities in the alignment of structure and 
strategy is the topic of Chapter 5.

48 CHAPTER 2: INTRODUCING THE PRACTICE OF STRATEGY  
The big picture  
In this chapter, we proposed that strategy is generally a messier process with more 
participants than conventional perspectives of strategy, as a formal process, would suggest. 
In developing our perspective, we suggested that a variety of strategists contribute, 
through their strategising activities, to ensure that the organisation is continually aligned 
(through its strategic choices ) with its external and internal environment. In examining 
strategy, we also adopted the perspective that the context of Africa is a critical influence 
on strategising and strategy, and suggested that organisational sustainability (the ability to 
sustain r esources and the uses thereof) is a key goal of any organisation. Table 2.2 is a 
summary comparison of the conventional approach to strategic management and our 
approach in this book.  
Summary of learning outcomes  
LO 1: Explain the origins of strategic mana gement.  
In Section 2.1, we discussed the evolution of strategy as a military concept to the notion of 
strategic management as a concept utilised by modern businesses in the pursuit of 
competitive advantage.  
LO 2: Identify and explain the universal principles of strategic 
management  
While there may be many different perspectives of what strategy is, Section 2.2 introduces 
seven principles of strategic management that most academics and practitioners of strategic 
management agree on.  
LO 3: Define stra tegy and explain its importance to the organisation.  
In Sections 2.3.1 through 2.3.4, we explain what it means to be strategic, and develop 
definitions for ‘strategy’ and ‘strategic management’. We also explore the importance of 
strategy and the organisati on’s strategic management.  
LO 4: Identify the characteristics of strategic decision -making, and provide 
guidelines to strategic decision -makers to aid them in making better 
strategic decisions.  
Strategic decisions are complex and there are no clear ‘right’  answers. In Section 2.4, we 
outline the rational and cognitive aspects, as well as the political aspects of strategic 
decisions, and provide guidelines for ‘good’ strategic decision -making.  
LO 5: Explain how the success of strategy can be measured.  
he bus iness world is filled with examples of the negative effects of pursuing short term 
profits above all else. In Section 2.5, we explain that strategy should always be a out the 
long term and creating value for stakeholders (ie sustainability), rather than ou t short -term 
profits.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
LO 6: Discuss a contemporary strategic management framework.  
In Section 2.6, we introduce the idea of an integrated framework for strategic management, 
which also serves as an outline for this book. The framework suggests that strategic 
management is ultimately about finding a balance between the processes of strategy 
formation and organisational architecture.

In Chapter 2, we explained that the aim of strategic management is to 
ensure that an organisation achieves competitive advantage, and 
sustains its competitive advantage over competitors. Strategic 
management helps organisations to achieve superior performance and 
sustainability over the long term. Although there are many different 
approaches to strategic management, the ultimate aim of any strategic 
management activity is survival and long -term goal achievement in a 
changing environment. However, strategic  management is not only aimed at improving the long -term sur vival of 
profit -oriented organisations, but it also adds value to non -profit 
organisations, public organisations, governments, sport societies and 
schools. In fact, the principles of strategic management are such that it 
can help and guide any organisation , institution and individual towards 
achieving their goals despite changes in the environment.  
The case study describes Capitec's success in the banking 
industry. The basis of Capitec's success is its commitment to its 
medium - and long -term strategy. The c ase study also highlights the 
fact that a clear understanding of the needs of the market informed 
Capitec's efforts to offer simplified and affordable banking products. 
The Capitec strategies are formulated through a deliberate process to 
evaluate strategi c options in terms of the business context in which it 
finds itself, which is the focus if this chapter.  
The process to formulate strategies can take many forms and 
involves the entire organisation on various levels. Table 2.1 in Chapter 
2 depicted the lev els of strategic decision -making and indicated the 
three levels of strategy (corporate level, business level and functional 
level). For the most part, all organisations will have strategies on each 
level and the implementation of these strategies cascades throughout. 
Yet, the approach followed is unique to each organisation and there 
may be vast differences between, for example, Capitec's approach and 
that of the Absa Banking Group. In addition, the approach followed by 
a small business may be entirely diff erent from the approach followed 
by a large business which has clearly defined business levels and 
business units. What is, however, found to be common among the 
different approaches to formulating strategies is the involvement of 
senior management, a focu s on the long term and a commitment to 
the entire organisation (and not only a business unit, department or 
section within). It is necessary to note here that the process of 
formulating strategies entails much more than strategic breakaways 
and glossy inte grated reports. It is also entirely possible that some 
organisations have all their strategies written down and documented 
while others have a less formal approach. The process of formulating 
strategies leads to actions to implement the strategies and deli berate 
attempts to monitor their progress.  
Strategic management and the processes associated with 
strategising are not new concepts. Strategic management has been 
part of every organisation, albeit in a deliberate and formal approach, 
or an emergent adapti on to survive in a changing environment. The 
original approaches to strategic management were grounded in 
business policies and planning approaches. Strategic management then 
evolved into a process consisting of definite stages or phases. Later, 
and most r ecently, strategic management is considered from a practice 
perspective, wherein the impetus is on the 'doing' part.  
54  
This chapter focuses on the process perspective of strategic 
management, which can be described as a formal, rational approach to 
developing deliberate strategies for achieving strategic 
competitiveness and competitive advantage. It is part of strategy 
formation, as illustrated in Figure 3.1, focusing on the content  part of 
strategy formation. The discu ssions in this chapter will commence with 
an explanation of the process perspective of strategic management, 
followed by an explanation of the new competitive realities and 
criticisms of the process perspective. The management levels involved 
in strategic management will then be addressed. Thereafter, each of 
the phases in the process perspective of strategic management will be 
explained with practical examples illustrating these phases.

Case study  
Capitec - no longer just a new kid on the block  
The four major South African banks, Standard Bank, Absa Bank, FirstRand Bank and Nedbank, 
share about 80 per cent of the market. The remainder of the market belongs to a 
combination of other role -players in the industry. According to the South African Banking 
Sector Overview, the SA banking industry consists of 17 registered banks, two mutual banks, 
14 local branches of foreign banks, two co -operative banks and 43 foreign banks with 
approved local representative offices.1 When one looks at the latest full -year data from the 
retail banks, the battle to  be the biggest is fierce between FirstRand and Standard Bank. 
What is exciting to see is the growth of Capitec. Out of nowhere in 2001, Capitec emerged 
with a dream to provide low -cost financial services to low -income groups. From a humble 
beginning, Capi tec moved in and, 15 years later, celebrated an increase in headline earnings 
of 18 per cent to R3.8 billion for the 2016 financial year. These earnings represented a record 
growth of 1.3 million with 8.6 million active clients.2 During March 2017, Capitec  revealed 
that it was adding 120,000 new banking clients each month!3 In terms of the customer base, 
Capitec secured more than 15 per cent of the customers in the South African banking sector.  
What is the secret to Capitec's success? How did it move from b eing the new kid on 
the block to becoming a noticeable presence and a real threat to the big four banks in South 
Africa?  
According to the 2016 South African Customer Satisfaction Index (SAcsi) report, 
Capitec outcompeted all the other banks in terms of cus tomer satisfaction - for three years in 
a row.4 Capitec changed the game of banking by offering a simplified and affordable product 
- built on set fees and a single account over the often -complex calculations and bundled 
product offerings from competing gr oups.5 
Capitec is led by its CEO, Gerrie Fourie, who confirms that the bank will continue its 
focus on the fundamentals of delivering simplified banking that is affordable and easy to 
access through personal service.  
This resonates with most South Africans  and is what sets us apart, especially in the 
current tough economic climate, giving clients a sense of value and allowing them 
to feel in control of their money. Through strong marketing communications, a 
focus on client service and positive word of mouth , the Capitec brand has grown in 
stature, with South Africans from all walks of life accepting Capitec as their first 
choice bank.6 
Overall, Capitec is committed to sustainable profit. This is achieved through the right 
strategy, focused leadership, a healthy corporate culture based on strong values and 
responding to stakeholders' needs. Capitec's strategies are built on providing a un ique 
service, enhancing the product offering, growing the client numbers, increasing transaction 
income, managing costs of credit to clients, and responsible risk management. These strategies 
are crafted over the short to medium term (one to five years) wi thout losing focus on the 
long term (more than five years). The long -term view is to become

a preferred global retail bank enabled through virtual banking. The foundation of Capi tec's 
success includes its competitive culture and its ability to achieve results through operational 
excellence and teamwork. These are key ingredients in Capitec’s growth and its success in 
executing an innovative strategy.  
LO 1:  Explain  the process  perspective  of strategic  management.  
3.1 A process perspective of strategic management  
The traditional view of strategic management is that it is a process with distinct  
stages or phases. The approach adopted in this book is that strategic management is  
a complex and dynamic discipline and that a static, linear process does not consider  
the complexity or the environment in which the organisation operates (refer to the  
contemporary strategic management framework provided in Chapter 2, Figure 2.4).  
However, an unders tanding of the process perspective of strategic management is a  
valuable starting point and offers a sound theoretical foundation from which to work.  
The three stages of the process perspective are depicted in Figure 3.2.  
 ------------   
? 
This is the first stage of the  strategic management process. This stage is  
a conceptual process that consists of environmental analyses and the  
development of strategies.  
 ___________________________  1 ________________   
Strategic implementation  
This is the second stage of the strategic management process and is referred to as the  action 
phase. All staff in the organisation are tasked with implementing the strategies.

Strategic control  
This is the third stage of the strategic management process and is also referred to as the 
review or monitoring phase. The strategy review phase i s 
aimed at monitoring progress and providing feedback.   ---------------   
Figure 3.2 The process perspective of strategic management  
The strategy planning stage is often also referred to as strategy crafting. The strategy 
implementation stage is also referred to as strategy execution and strategic control is also 
referred to as the strategy review stage or strategy review and control stage.  Strategic 
planning  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
It is important to realise that strategic management is a continuous activity and information 
obtained through the strategic review or control stage feeds back into strategic planning and 
strategy implementation. The following section offers a more detailed explanation of each 
of these stages.  
3.1.1  Strategic planning  
The strategic planning stage is the starting point of the strategic management process. The 
process perspective to strategic management is often also referred to as the traditional 
perspective. Traditionally, it was accepted that the roles between the different levels of 
management were clearly defined and that the top managers were the key strategists in the 
organisation, while the middle and lower level of managers were mostly involved in 
implementing the strategies developed by the top ma nagement team. Strategic planning, 
according to the process perspective, is the stage in which the top management team (the 
strategists) decide on the strategic direction of the organisation as a whole. Typically, this 
stage mostly involves senior manageme nt who conduct various analyses of the organisation 
itself, as well as of the environment in which it operates. Part of this phase is the setting of 
strategic direction, in other words, deciding on the future of the organisation and setting the 
overarching  goals of the organisation. For example, when looking at the case study about 
Capitec, the founder, Michiel le Roux, had a vision for a low -cost bank for low -income 
customers. The vision formed the centre of the founding, listing and operations of the bank . 
The vision set the strategic planning process in motion. During this stage, the top 
management team devised a vision or dream for such a bank; analysed the environment and 
competitors, and then devised strategies to achieve its dream. The practising stra tegy box 
below provides comments from Michiel le Roux (founder) and Gerrie Fourie (current CEO) 
and show how the overarching goal is still guiding Capitec’s activities - 15 years down the 
line. The practising strategy box also includes the company slogan w hich exclaims that 
Capitec offers simple banking - aligned to the original vision of offering a simple and low -
cost banking solution.  
Practising strategy: Capitec  
Bruce Whitfield's interview with Capitec founder, Michiel le Roux, 20 July 20167 
Twitter comments:  
'I originally had a very basic bank in mind.’8 
'I told our shareholders we'll either be a big success or a small failure. Not in my 
wildest dreams could I foresee the success we've had.'  
'We'll keep it simple. In 10 years it'll still be recognisa ble as the bank you see today.'9 
58 CHAPTER 3: A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
Comments from new Capitec CEO, Gerrie Fourie:  
When asked what the future strategy for Capitec will hold, Gerrie Fourie stated 
that 'more of the same, but, my tenure will have an increased focus on what is in 
the client's best interest. ... I need to build on this platform and drive the 
organisation to deliver even more value for each client. This will further 
differentiate us from other banks, off ering greater convenience and attracting 
more primary bank clients'.10 
It's banking, just simpler.  
From one banking solution and innovative tech to Sunday and paperless banking, 
everything we do is to make your life easier and empower you to take control o f 
your money.1’ 
In addition to a company slogan, a range of management tools can be used to set strategic 
direction, such as a vision statement, a purpose or mission statement, or a statement of 
strategic intent. Some organisations also include a value sta tement. Looking at Capitec 
again, their slogan can be translated into a mission and values statement that provides more 
detail about their product and service offerings, their markets, the technologies they use to 
make banking simpler, and their commitment  to their stakeholders.  
During the strategic planning stage, various analyses take place and the senior 
managers gather information about the operations, resources and capabilities of the 
organisation. The senior management team also scans the environment to identify potential 
opportunities and threats, as well as evaluating the market or industry in which the 
organisation operates and collecting information on competitors. This is referred to as an 
external environmental analysis. The senior management tea m also scans the internal 
environment, in other words, the organisation itself, with the purpose of identifying its 
own strengths and weaknesses. Once all the information from the exiernal and internal 
environments has been collected and analysed, the seni or management team then considers 
the various strategic options and chooses those strategies where the fit between what the 
organisation can do with the opportunities is the strongest. In addition, the senior 
management team formulates the strategic goals for the organisation. For example, 
FlySafair entered the low -cost airline industry with a vision to open the skies to many who 
had never flown before.12 Their strategy is premised on their commitment to make prices 
sustainable and to keep them low. FlySafa ir aims to keep costs per seat as low as possible. 
Part of its actions included changing the seats on its aircraft to make it lighter and thinner, 
thereby reducing Fuel costs .]i Linked to its mission to provide low -fare, hassle -free and on -
time travel expe riences, one of FlySafair’s strategic goals may, for example, be that 
FlySafair will achieve a 95 per cent on -time performance while offering seats at 5 per cent 
less than competitors will. This deliberate decision to focus on low -cost air travel is a 
resu lt of an external environmental analysis that identified the opportunities in these 
markets.  
59 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
An analysis of the organisation’s internal environment identified various strengths of the 
organisation that enable them to make use of the opportunities identified in the external 
environmental analysis. Once the strategies to take the organisation towards the 
achievement of its objectives have been selected, the next stage of the strategic 
manage ment process starts, namely strategy implementation.  
3.1.2  Strategy implementation  
The second stage of the strategic management process is referred to as the strategy 
implementation stage and is considered the most challenging stage in any strategic 
management process. As we explained earlier, the process perspective to strategic 
management offers a traditional approach in which the top management team, or senior 
management team, was responsible for the strategy formation and the middle and lower -
level managers were seen as the implementers of the strategies devised by the senior 
managers.  
Once the senior management team has selected the strategies of the organisation, 
they need to be put into action. This requires the involvement of everyone in the 
organisation.  The corporate strategies, and the senior management team’s rationale for 
selecting them, need to be communicated to all parties. Not only should the organisation 
members be told what the strategies and overarching objectives of the organisation are, but 
the senior management team also need to ensure that there is understanding and buy -in 
because the wider the organisational support, the greater the chances of successful 
implementation. Members must be motivated and energised towards achieving these goals 
on business, functional levels and even individual levels.  
Operationalising strategies are an important aspect of strategy implementation. They 
entail translating the overarching and strategic objectives into specific programmes, 
projects, tasks and activit ies. The middle and lower management levels in the organisation 
are responsible for this, as well as for overseeing it, so they must be empowered to do so. 
By translating the strategic goals or long -term objectives into shorter term goals and 
activities, t he organisation members becomc aware of their roles in the strategic success of 
the organisation (refer to Figure 1.1 in Chapter 1 that depicts the hierarchy of 
organisational plans).  
At its most basic level, strategy implementation is the action (‘doing’)  stage of the 
process perspective of strategic management. Actions to successfully implement strategies 
are ensured through certain drivers such as leadership, management, and culture. 
Organisational culture is commonly referred to as ‘the way we do things  around here’ and 
how things are done will impact on success. For example, if the organisational culture is 
negative and there is little support for the strategies, then the strategy implementation 
process becomes more challenging and can actually fail. Bu t when the organisational 
culture is positive and there is wide buy -in, the efforts to implement the strategies are more 
co-ordinated and have a greater chance of success. Organisational culture and strategy are 
discussed in detail in Chapter 11.  
60 CHAPTER 3: A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
The middle and lower levels of managers can use rewards to drive strategy implementation. 
By rewarding the actions, tasks and behaviour that contribute towards successful 
implement ation of strategies, managers enhance the chances of strategy success. Managers 
should thus devise reward strategies and systems that are aligned to the overall strategic 
direction of the organisation.  
The way that the organisation is structured also impacts on the strategy 
implementation process. If the strategy requires quick decision -making, then a bureaucratic 
structure that entails time -consuming red tape may hamper efforts. The organisational 
structure not only indicates the lines of authority an d reporting, but also the process and 
lines for strategy implementation. Coupled with the structure of the organisation are the 
inherent systems and policies inside the organisation. Organisational systems, processes 
and policies are used to direct the exe cution efforts. Again, the systems, processes and 
policies should be aligned with the overall strategic direction of the organisation.  
Finally, leaders and managers in the organisation need to empower and enable the 
employees and organisation members to ca rry out the tasks to implement the strategies. 
This requires the appropriate allocation of financial, human, physical and informational 
resources. If the resources are lacking, the implementation efforts will surely fail.  
Although monitoring the implementa tion of the strategies takes place continuously, 
in terms of the process perspective on strategic management, it is regarded as the third 
stage.  
3.1.3  Strategy review and control  
Strategy review and control involves monitoring the progress of strategy implementa tion, 
measuring actual or realised performance, comparing actual performance with planned 
performance, identifying problems and instituting any necessary corrective actions. 
Although described as the third and final stage in the strategic management proces s, it is a 
continuous process. As strategies are implemented, the strategy review takes place.  
Different methods of strategy review exist. One such method is continuous 
environmental scanning, which can be considered a review method as it provides feedback  
on changes in the environment that may impact on strategic choices and their execution. 
Another form of strategy review is implementation control. Similar to operational control, 
this is where deviations from the plans are identified and addressed as they  occur. This 
implies that corrective measures are taken during the strategy implementation process to 
ensure that the strategic management process continues successfully.  
It is mostly senior and middle managers who are involved in the strategy review 
process. Most important is the feedback from the review that needs to serve a<> input in the 
amendment of existing strategies and goals, or the possible total reconsideration o f the 
strategies and goals. Continuous feedback forms the foundation of the strategic 
management process.

LO 2:  Criticise  the process  perspective  of strategic  management.  
3.2 The new competit ive realities - criticising the 
process perspective of strategic management  
The biggest critique of the process perspective of strategic management is that, in being a 
linear process, the complexity of the environment is not considered and dealt with 
sufficiently. Also, the process perspective supports the notion that it is mainly the top 
management team or senior managers who craft or formulate strategies while other levels 
of management merely implement those strategies.  
In practice, strategic manage ment is much more complex and dynamic than is 
portrayed in the process perspective. Strategy is not something that an organisation has, but 
is rather something that an organisation, and the people in the organisation, does.  The 
reality of strategic managem ent in the contemporary business environment is that it is a 
messy and complex process, influenced by many different aspects. Strategy, in reality, is 
crafted through a process of conversation and input from all levels in the organisation and 
inputs from v arious stakeholders (as discussed in Chapter 1, Section 1.7).  
In Chapter 4, we take a closer look at who does strategy in organisations.  
LO 3:  Identify and explain the various management levels involved in strategic  
management.  
3.3 The management levels involved in strategic 
management  
In a medium to large -sized organisation, there are usually three levels of management, 
namely top management, middle management and lower -level management. Top 
management comprises the CEO, the board of directors and senior  managers. As described 
above, the top management team (or senior management team) will play a major role in 
setting the organisation’s strategic direction and in analysing the environment. The 
information they gather will then be used to formulate the str ategies.  
It is mostly the middle and lower -level managers who are responsible for the 
execution of the strategies through the managing of employees. The top managers rely on 
the middle managers to ensure that their planned strategies are implemented. Top 
management then becomes more involved once again during the strategy review process. 
Chapter 4 offers a more detailed discussion of strategists.  
62 CHAPTER 3: A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
LO 4:  Explain  strategic  planning  and recognise the strategic direction and  
environmental analysis in organisations.  
The following section discusses in more detail the process of strategic planning. The 
practising strategy box offers some background on Katlego Global Logistics and includes  
the vision and mission statement to serve as an example.  
Katlego Global Logistics (Pty) Ltd was founded in 1998 by Moses Maboi and borne out 
of his drive and enthusiasm for attaining efficient and dependable service in the freight 
logistics industry. From  the onset, Moses was motivated by his passion for his country 
and his dream to contribute to South Africa's economic potential by partnering with 
stakeholders to contribute to the development and value add for black -owned and -
managed companies. Given his  years of experience in the industry, Moses set out, not 
only to render quality and professional services in all freight - and trade -related 
services, but also to the develop skills of employees through training and exposure.  
Katlego Global Logistics offers  solutions in the areas of clearing and forwarding, 
air freighting and car -going, supply chain and inventory management, logistics, 
customs broking and project shipments.  
Katlego Global Logistics adds the value of time and place utility as it offers 
integr ated services and tailored, customer -focused solutions for managing and 
transporting documents, goods and information. This involves the integration of 
information, transportation, inventory, warehousing, material handling and packaging, 
and occasionally, security.  
The company has become recognised as a freight and courier industry expert, 
supply -ehain innovator and a business partner. It does not use contractors within the 
boundaries of South Africa, assuring customers that it is tracking and keeping their  
precious cargo safe. With a dedicated national fleet of vehicles ranging from small, 
utility one -ton vans to larger eight -ton trucks, Katlego Global Logistics is well 
represented nationally.  
The vision of Katlego Global Logistics is to be the preferred su pplier in the 
height logistics industry known for excellent service delivery. Their mission is:  
To lead with insight and innovation, constantly strengthening the company's 
rpsihmn* a n(j ensuring fhQt our customers' needs are addressed with the utmost  3.4 Strategic planning

63 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
3.4.1  The strategic direction of the organisation  
The organisation’s management and employees need to know the reasons for the 
organisation’s existence. The strategic direction clarifies the overarching purpose and goals 
of the organisation, as well as i ndicating to external stakeholders what the organisation is 
about. Several management tools are used to set the strategic direction. As an example, the 
practising strategy box on Katlego Global Logistics provides its vision and mission 
statements that offe r a clear message on its purpose. The following section explains how 
the vision statement, the mission statement and the strategic goals are used to direct the 
actions and strategic efforts of the organisation over the long term.  
Not only does the strategi c direction provide the organisation and its members with 
a primary direction, but it also helps bind the organisation members as a cohesive unit. 
Figure 3.3 depicts the benefit of strategic direction. The diagram below indicates the 
multiple different dir ections in which the organisation and its members are working. The 
other one shows how the overall stated strategic direction (represented by the blue arrow) 
aligns the efforts of the entire organisation and its members in one direction.  
 
Having sound strategic direction is a powerful contributor to strategic success as it forms 
the starting point for a carefully planned and implemented strategy. It also provides focus 
and directs all actions towards achieving the same goal.  
Some organisations do not have separate vision and mission statements, while others 
have only mission statements. Organisations are diverse and varied, just like the people 
who work in them, and this creates room for a range of different practices. The strategic 
direction can be expressed through a vision, a mission or both. What is crucial is that the 
entire organisation and its members know where they are going and w hat they are working 
towards.  
Table 3.1 offers a summary of the advantages of having clear strategic direction, 
expressed through the vision and mission statements of organisations.  
64  
CHAPTER 3: A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE OF STRATEGIC MA NAGEMENT  
Table 3.1 Advantages of having clear strategic direction  
1. It provides direction and a clear indication of what the organisation  is aiming for.  
2. It ensures that all the organisational efforts and all the organisation  members are  
working towards the same goals.  
3. It offers a clear message to internal and external stakeholders on what the 
organisation wants to achieve over the long term.  
4. It guides problem -solving and decision -making as the end goal is clear to all.  
5. It provides the organisation with a unique identity.  
6. It contributes to synergy among all managers and other employees and stakeholders.  
The vision statement  
The vision statement is often referred to as the dream of the organisation. It is used as an 
indicator of the desired future position o f the organisation. It is often not realistic in literal 
terms. For example, the vision of Katlego Global Logistics (see the practising strategy box 
provided earlier) is to be ‘the preferred supplier in the freight logistics industry known for 
excellent se rvice delivery’. This may seem overly ambitious, but it is a powerful statement 
designed to motivate the entire organisation. Another example is that of the freight 
division of Grindrod Limited. Their vision is ‘to be a dominant and profitable freight 
serv ices provider focusing on infrastructural development on the African continent’. The 
delineation of ‘African continent’ clarifies their playing field. A good vision statement 
should identify the direction and future of the organisation. As the entire organ isation and 
its members need to work towards reaching this future destination, it should be persuasive 
and credible, and easily understood.  
There is no standard format for a vision statement. Some organisations may opt for 
short and punchy vision statement s, while others may opt for more descriptive versions. 
However, there are certain guidelines for what a vision statement should be, namely:  
¦ It should present a clear picture of a desirable future, something to which the 
organisation and its stakeholders can aspire.  
¦ It should guide decision -making, yet be flexible enough to allow the organisation 
to respond to changes in the environment.  
¦ It should be easy to communicate, to explain and to understand.  
Ultimately, the vision is not just a statement on a piec e of paper, but rather galvanises and 
directs people in the organisation.  
The mission statement  
The mission statement is also called the purpose statement of the organisation. In its most 
simplistic form, the mission statement provides an indication of what the organisation does 
and why it exists. The mission statement builds on the vision  
65 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
statement. The mission statement is not only used internally within the organisation, but 
often us ed in external communication and the media. The mission is as much an internal 
statement as it is an external statement. The three core components of a mission statement 
are product and/or service, market  and technology:  
¦ The product and/or service: A missi on statement should indicate the product or 
service that the organisation offers and should answer the question ‘what are our 
primary products and/or services that we offer?’  
¦ The market: A mission statement should indicate the market that it hopes to serve  
and should answer the question ‘who is our primary target market?’  
¦ Technology: Lastly, a mission statement should indicate the method (technology) 
used to deliver this product or service to the market and should answer the 
question ‘what technology will b e used to provide the products and services to 
our market/s?’  
In addition, a well -formulated mission statement could also contain the following:  
¦ Often organisations give an indication of their commitment to stakeholders by 
including how important their cus tomers are, or how the organisation invests in 
its employees or builds relationships with business partners (see Chapter 1 for an 
explanation of stakeholders). A good example is City Lodge Hotels:15 
We will be recognised as the preferred Southern African h otel group. 
Through dedicated leadership, teamwork and kindness, we will 
demonstrate our consistent commitment to delivering caring service with 
style and grace.  We will constantly enhance our guest experience through 
our passionate people, ongoing innovat ion and leading -edge technology. 
Our integrity ; values and ongoing investment in our people and hotels will 
provide exceptional returns to stakeholders and ensure continued, 
sustainable growth. Through acts of kindness,  we will make a positive 
difference t o our guests, our colleagues, our communities and our 
environment.  
¦ The organisation’s orientation towards survival and growth is often expressed 
through stating their commitment to economic objectives. For example, 
ADvTECH, a placement, private education a nd training provider listed on the 
JSE, specifically refers to their aim to build, grow and achieve:  
We aim to BUILD and grow a high -quality organisation in education, 
training and placement that is widely recognised for passionate 
commitment and success in enriching people's lives and future.  We aim to 
GROW a reputation for our ability to make a real difference to the people  
we serve, for our connectedness and partnerships with African and global 
markets and players, for the relevance, quality and usefuln ess of our 
offerings, and for the enterprising and agile way in which we tackle our 
task. We will ACHIEVE this by focusing on  
66 CHAPTER 3: A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
our customers and taking a lead from our markets, by  our innovative 
approach, especially in harnessing the power of technology, and by striving 
for excellence and sustainability in all we do.'6 
¦ Organisational values are principles that the organisation stands by; these values 
are held in high regard within the organisation and sets the standard of how the 
organisation wants to do business. An example of a mission statement that 
includes the organisation’s values is Virgin Money, a financial services brand 
that entered the South African market with an aim of simplifying banking:  
Our mission is to give you: 1. A great deal, 2. Straightforward financial 
products, 3. Brilliant service.17 
¦ The organisational philosophy offers an indication of how the organisation plans 
to do business. The organisational philosophy is often linked to ethical 
standards; for example, Premier Hotels and Resorts, a hospitality service 
provider with hotels and resorts in South Africa has the following philosophy:  
l/Ve are a professional, passionate, caring and empowering company that 
enco urages innovation and engagement.  We are a learning organisation 
committed to the retention and development of our people as an essential 
part of building strong, respectful and enduring guest relationships. Our 
staff are motivated, friendly and obsessive about enhancing the guest 
experience through meeting and  exceeding expectations for quality 
service.'8 
The value of setting clear strategic direction, whether through a vision or mission 
statement or both, is an important contributor to organisational succ ess. 
The process of formulating a mission statement  
Strategic direction is long term and ought to remain unchanged for an extended period. 
Organisations that change their strategic direction on an annual basis send a message that 
they are not sure where they are going. As the vision and mission statements are an 
expression of the strategic direction, these should also remain largely unchanged except, 
perhaps, for minor amendments to the wording.  
Although there is no one agreed method for drafting a missio n statement, most agree 
that it should involve as many people as possible because this contributes towards 
acceptance. External consultants may also be called in, but it is very important that the 
strategic direction be created internally.  
One way to craft  a mission statement is as follows:  
¦ Orient those involved as to what constitutes a well -formulated mission statement.  
¦ Do a brainstorming exercise to generate as many creative ideas as possible.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
¦ Collate all the draft ideas and distribute them for comment.  
¦ Continue this process until there is agreement on what the mission should be.  
In the case of a start -up business, it is easier for a management team to compile the 
strategic direction. Fo r established and multi -business organisations, however, the 
management team will need to maintain the business operations while the process to amend 
or redesign the strategic direction is underway.  
Strategic goals  
Flowing directly from the mission statement is the need to translate the overarching 
direction of the organisation into strategic goals. The strategic goals have a shorter time 
frame than the vision and mission statements (five to ten years as a rule of thumb) because 
they are determined b y the nature and the level of complexity and rate of change in an 
organisation and within its industry.  
To be of value, strategic goals need to be measurable in terms of time, money and units. 
Table 3.2 compares well -formulated and poorly formulated strate gic goals.  
Table 3.2 A comparison of well and poorly formulated strategic goals  
Poorly formulated strategic goals  Well -formulated strategic goals  
Our goal is to increase our market 
share.  Our goal is to increase our market share by 3°/o by 
the end of 2021.  
The goal for 2021 is to expand our 
product range.  The goal for 2021 is to expand our product range 
by introducing two new products in the baby 
clothing division.  
By 2023, we will open new stores.  By 2023, we will open one new store in Mahikeng, 
in the North West Province and one new store in 
Kimberley, Northern Cape.  
The SMART principles can be used to formulate good strategic goals:  
S - specific M - 
measurable A - 
achievable R - 
realistic T - 
time  
Goals should be specific and measurable so that people know exactly what it is that will be 
expected of them. Goals must be considered attainable by those who need to work towards 
achieving them (if, on the one hand, they seem impossible to reach, people will see no point 
in even trying or will quickly become discouraged).  CHAPTER 3: A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
The goals should be realistic, yet aimed at a level that will motivate people (on the other 
hand, if they are too easy to reach, people will not be inspired to work harder). Finally, a 
well -formulated goal is linked to a specific time period so people have a deadline to work 
towards (an open -ended goal will carry no sense of urgency and could take years to 
complete).  
Over and above meeting the SMART principles, strategic goals should also be 
congruent with the mission statement components, the overall strategic direction of the 
organisation and should focus on the key performance areas of the organisation (the next 
section will focus on the use of the balanced sc orecard to identify these areas). Also, goals 
should be acceptable - people tend to pursue goals that are consistent with their preferences 
and perceptions. Lastly, strategic goals should be flexible. Organisations function in a 
turbulent business environm ent, which makes it necessary to allow for goals to be modified 
due to changing circumstances.  
Using the balanced scorecard to set strategic goals  
The balanced scorecard (BSC) is a strategic management tool that was developed by Kaplan 
and Norton.19 When u sed in the strategic planning stage, it guides the organisation and 
management team to translate the strategic direction into strategic goals. One of the 
benefits of the BSC is that it offers a balanced approach to setting strategic goals. The 
‘balance’ is  grounded in its four perspectives: financial, customer, learning and growth, 
and business processes. At the centre of these, is the strategic direction, which will include 
the vision, mission and other statements.  
For each perspective of the BSC, strategi c goals need to be formulated that will 
contribute to the achievement of the strategic direction. Each perspective offers a view on 
what needs to be done with a focus on two internal measures (internal business processes 
and learning and growth) and two ex ternal measures (customers and finance). The balance 
between the internal and external perspectives ensure that the strategic goals are aligned 
with the strategic direction. The four perspectives of the BSC are explained below:  
¦ The financial perspective, with a focus on the financial performance of the 
organisation. The financial perspective is linked to the expectations and needs of 
the shareholders, as well as to the financial performance or stewardship of the 
organisation.  
¦ The customer perspective, with  a focus on how the organisation’s customers 
perceive it. The customer perspective works towards a focus on satisfying 
customer needs and a consideration of how customers see the organisation.  
¦ The learning and growth perspective, with a focus on sustainabl e growth, value 
creation and innovation. This perspective is also called organisational capacity 
and is aimed at the employees (human capital) and the capacity to achieve its 
goals.  
¦ The business process perspective, with a focus on the core capabilities at  which 
the organisation must excel in order to be competitive. This perspective is linked 
to quality and efficiency in all that the organisation does.  
69 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Each of these four perspectives is linked to a specific question which guides the setting of 
the strategic goals. Given the foci of each of these perspectives, the BSC is a handy tool 
that is used to translate the strategic direction into goals and targets. These targets can be 
seen as the shorter term aims at the business level, which guides the activities or actions 
needed on the functional level. Figure 3.4 provides guiding questions for each perspective. 
These four questions are used to select the most important strategic goals on corpor ate 
level (refer to Table 2.1 in Chapter 2, where a distinction was made between the various 
levels of strategy). A successful application of the BSC may include two to five goals in 
each perspective and each goal should be joined by a performance target t hat indicates 
whether the goal is achieved, as part of the review process.

The scorecard is balanced in that it includes strategic goals and measures for all four 
perspectives. The purpose is  to ‘balance’ the strategic goals by ensuring that one business 
area (such as finance) does not dominate the strategic direction of the organisation, while, 
at the same time, ensuring a focus on a few key metrics that could serve as a ‘scorecard’ 
for the w hole organisation.  
Table 3.3 provides examples of goals, metrics, targets and initiatives for each of the

The following practising strategy box uses CellMobile as an example of the application of 
the BSC.  
Practising strategy: An example of the 
application of the balanced scorecard  
CellMobile is a (fictitious) organisation in the South African cellular telephone 
industry. Their vision is to be the preferred supplier of pre -paid cellular services. Their 
growth strategy is aimed at developing their market by targeting customers in rural 
areas where other cellular services are unreliable and often interrupted.  
If CellMobile uses the balanced scorecard, their starting point will be the vision 
and strat egy which is aimed at growth. In each of the perspectives, they will set 
objectives, measures, targets and initiatives that contribute to being the preferred 
supplier and growing their market. For example, in terms of the customer perspective, 
a goal might  be to increase the retention of existing customers by 5 per cent per annum 
for the next three years. The targets to be achieved, then, would be 'five per cent 
retention' and ‘within a three -year period'. The initiatives to achieve this could now be 
devise d, such as improving customer service by enhancing the CellMobile website 
services, or by making pre -paid vouchers more readily available. In terms of the 
business process perspective, CellMobile could set a goal to expand the cellular phone 
towers to ensu re better service delivery and thereby be in a position to recruit more 
customers and thus grow their business. The goal could be to expand by two new 
towers every three months over the next two years. For this goal, the targets would be 
'two towers’, 'eve ry three months' and ‘over the next two years', and the initiatives 
could then be formulated.  
71 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
The diagram below depicts the customer perspective within CeilMobile.  
 
The balanced scorecard offers a valuable framework for setting strategic goals.  
Once the strategic goals have been formulated, the strategy selection process starts. This is 
discussed in Chapter 7. In Sections 3.5 and 3.6, we provided a brief overview of the 
strategy implementation and strategy review processes.  
3.4.2  The role of environmental analysis in the strategic 
management process  
Continuous scanning o f the external and internal environments of an organisation supports 
the strategic management process. The purpose of scanning the external environment is to 
identify opportunities that may be exploited, or threats that may prevent the organisation 
from at taining its strategic objectives.  
Internal analysis is done for the purpose of understanding the organisation’s key 
strengths and key weaknesses, so that it can build on key strengths and counter or mitigate 
key weaknesses. The role of resources and capabi lities is discussed in Chapter 6.  
While many organisations do environmental scanning periodically (for example, at 
an annual strategic planning workshop) it should really be an ongoing process that forms 
part of strategic evaluation and control (see Chapte r 14).  
72 CHAPTER 3: A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
LO 5:  Explain  strategy  implementation  and recognise  strategic  programmes,  
projects, the various drivers of strategy implementation and the 
operationalising of strategy in organisations.  
3.5 Strategy implementation  
The purpose of strategy implementation is to align the internal and external environments 
with the chosen strategy. Strategy implementation is often seen as the most challenging 
stage in the strategic management process. Scholars such as Jooste and Fourie,21 Candido 
and Santos,22 and Speculand23 documented some of the challenges linked to strategy 
implementation. In addition to the recognition in the scholarly community, examples of 
strategy implementation failure s often reach news headlines. Numerous studies have been 
conducted on strategy implementation and there is agreement amongst scholars and 
practitioners that strategy implementation is challenging, and it is where most strategy 
initiatives fail.  
3.5.1  Strategic p rogrammes and projects  
Figure 1.1 in Chapter 1, depicts the hierarchy of organisational plans, which indicates that 
strategic plans and initiatives should be managed as special programmes and projects with a 
view to eventually becoming part of the day -to-day operations of the organisation.  
3.5.2  Key drivers for implementing strategy  
Once a strategy has been selected, it needs to be communicated to the entire organisation 
and those who are tasked with implementing it, need to know exactly what is required. 
Effecti ve leadership and management are vital to the success of any strategy. The managers 
and leaders in the organisation are responsible, not only for communicating the strategy, 
but also for guiding the actions required to execute it. Simply informing staff an d other 
stakeholders is not enough. A general understanding of the rationale behind the strategy 
and the alleviation of any uncertainties are both vital to ensure agreement and support 
among all who are responsible for strategy implementation.  
Strategy exe cution and renewal is a continuous process with specific targets to be 
reached at specific points in time, and organisational management and leadership are 
responsible for keeping employees motivated. Because change goes hand -in-hand with 
uncertainty and r esistance, leaders will need to help members come to terms with the 
change and empower them to guide others to do the same. Behaviour, actions and tactics 
will need to be adapted. Involving people in the change process and ensuring that they 
understand the  reasons for the change will ease the transition. There should be a fine 
balance between driving the change and giving people time to adjust.  
Strategy implementation deals with the ‘doing’ part of the strategy, and 
organisational culture plays an important  role in the success or failure of an organisation. 
An unhealthy and negative culture can cause undue resistance to change which  
73 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
seriously hampers progress. This is something management and leadership will have to 
tackle as it can undermine the entire strategic management process. Organisational culture 
can help or hinder the strategy execution process. Chapters 11 and 12 deal with 
organisational culture and the role of strategic leaders respectively in more detail.  
Resource allocation is another important driver of strategy implementation. 
Resources comprise human resources, physical resources, information resources and time. 
Coupled with the allocation of resources, is the need for struc ture. Organisational structure 
indicates the lines of authority and responsibilities in the organisation. It forms the 
backbone of the organisation and helps to direct the various actions required to implement 
the strategies. The organisational structure n eeds to support the implementation of the 
strategies. A more detailed discussion of organisational structure is included in Chapter 13.  
Finally, the last driver of strategy implementation is organisational learning, which 
is covered in Chapter 9. Organisat ional learning is a process in response to change and 
provides for change, creating new knowledge and practices and, ultimately, the transferring 
of knowledge.  
3.5.3 Operationalising strategy  
Below is a brief explanation of the functional tactics (ie short -term goals) to explain how 
strategy is translated into operationalised actions. We remind you of Table 2.1 in Chapter 2 
where the levels of strategic decision -making are described. This section deals with 
operationalising strategic goals on the busin ess and functional levels.  
It is important that the entire workforce knows, not only the overall direction of the 
organisation, but also what needs to be done on a daily, weekly and monthly basis in order 
to achieve the strategic goals. The middle manageme nt cadre will take the lead in this 
process by translating the strategic goals into specific, measurable, achievable, realistic 
goals to be achieved within a year or less. Although the strategic goals are specific and 
measurable, their focus is on the long  term. In order to ensure that these strategic goals are 
operationalised, they need to be translated and adapted for the medium term. The same 
criteria required for setting strategic goals is important here. When the middle managers 
(such as the section he ads, departmental leaders and site managers) involve the supervisory 
level in this process, the acceptance of these medium -term goals is ensured. Medium -term 
goals are typically set for the functional areas in the organisation, such as the marketing, 
opera tions, human resources, finance and purchasing departments. The balanced scorecard 
also assists in this process. As we have explained earlier, the balanced scorecard has four 
perspectives and the organisation’s vision and strategy form the starting point. Within each 
perspective, the balanced scorecard is used to specify the goals, measures, targets and 
initiatives. Each business unit and department in the organisation will have its own focused 
and specifically balanced scorecard.  
In addition to the medium -term goals, functional tactics also need to be developed. 
Functional tactics provide even more detail to ensure the daily operationalisation of the 
organisation’s strategies. A functional tactic is developed in support of the short -term 
goals. Functional t actics are even more specific and  
74 CHAPTER 3: A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
require wider participation. The focus of the functional tactics is the tasks and activities 
required to operationalise the strategy and indicat e what needs to be done immediately and 
on a daily basis.  
Finally, the organisational actions to operationalise the strategy are guided by the 
organisational policies. Policies are often referred to as ‘red tape’ but form an important 
part of the fair and justified actions of the organisation and its workers. Policies provide 
detailed and specific guidelines and rules that direct the organisational activities - the 
framework and specific ‘do’s and don’ts’. Policies are often referred to as standard 
operatin g procedures. It is important that the organisational policies be documented and 
recorded in written format and made available to all the organisational members. In line 
with fair business practices, the policies should also be made available to the custom ers 
and other stakeholders. Policies guide the organisational managers in the control and co -
ordination of organisational activities.  
L06: Explain  strategy  review and control and identify the main strategic control  
mechanisms in organisations.  
3.6 Strategy rev iew and control  
This chapter started with an explanation of the strategic management process. We indicated 
earlier that the process begins with the development of the organisation's strategies, 
followed by their implementation. The third phase is the revie w and control phase. In this 
phase, the management uses a range of different measures and processes to check on the 
progress of the implementation process and monitors the need for changes to some of the 
previously developed strategies and goals. As organi sations operate in changing 
environments, the need for regular and continuous monitoring and review is important. 
Different methods to review the strategy implementation process exist and although the 
focus of each methodology is different, the aims remain  the same: review and control.  
Our focus is on the four main strategic control mechanisms, namely, premise 
control, strategic surveillance, special alert control and implementation/execution control. 
Typically, all four of these methodologies will be employed, but at different stages of the 
implementation process. When the strategies are devised, a number of assumptions or 
premises are made. Premise control is aimed at reviewing these assumptions in a focused 
way. If any of the assumptions are no longe r valid, a change in the strategy is required. 
This type of control is very specific. With its exclusive focus, it is possible that other 
factors, that may also bear an impact on the success of the strategy, are overlooked. Hence 
the need for the strategic  surveillance type of control.  
Strategic surveillance is also referred to as environmental scanning and is not 
focused, but rather opens the opportunity for managers to consider a whole range of 
¦nternal and external environmental factors. As organisations  operate in a changing  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
environment, some changes may occur that were not predicted. Despite the proactive nature 
of the strategic management process, it is impossible to predict and plan for  all changes, 
especially unexpected changes that lead to a total reconsideration of the strategies. This 
type of control is often referred to as implementation control or execution control. It takes 
place during the strategy execution process and comprises  four steps: setting the standard, 
measuring the actual, identifying deviations and taking corrective measures. The functional 
managers are responsible for this type of control, with inputs from the supervisory level. 
Special alert control is linked to a l argely unpredicted and unexpected event that warrants a 
total review of the strategy. Chapter 14 provides a detailed discussion of the different types 
of strategic review and control methodologies.  
The big picture  
The process perspective of strategic management advocates that strategic management 
comprise three stages, namely, strategic planning, strategy implementation and strategy 
review and control. The process perspective supports a linear approach to managing 
organisations strategically and is als o referred to as the traditional approach. Yet, as 
organisations and management thinking evolve, new perspectives and approaches to 
strategic management have emerged. These perspectives do not replace the traditional 
perspective, but rather open opportunit ies for managing organisations in new competitive 
realities.  
The focus of this chapter was to introduce different perspectives and to provide 
specific details on the process perspective of strategic management.  
Summary of learning outcomes  
L01: Explain the  process perspective of strategic management.  
The process perspective is a traditional approach to strategic management that follows a 
mostly linear process that is driven by the top management team and divided into three 
distinct stages or phases.  
LO 2: Criticise the process perspective of strategic management.  
The process perspective is a linear process that does not consider the complexity or the 
environment in which the organisation operates. The process perspective also sees strategy 
as a top -down function - with strategic decisions made by top management and middle 
managers tasked with implementing it.  CHAPTER 3: A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
LO 3: Identify and explain the management levels involved in strategic 
management.  
The different management levels involved in strategic management fall within three main 
categories: top management, middle management and lower -level management. For the 
most part, top management is responsible for setting the strategic direction  and middle and 
lower -level managers are responsible for the execution of the strategies.  
LO 4: Explain strategy strategic planning and recognise the strategic direction 
and environmental analysis in organisations.  
With the process perspective of strategic  management, the first stage is strategic planning 
that starts with the setting of the strategic direction. By having strategic direction, 
organisations and its members form a cohesive unit. Strategic direction is expressed 
through a vision and mission sta tement. Organisations operate as open systems in changing 
environments which require environmental analysis. Environmental analysis includes and 
analysis of both the internal and the external environment. The purpose of scanning the 
external environment is  to identify opportunities that may be exploited, or threats that may 
prevent the organisation from attaining its strategic objectives. Internal analysis is done for 
the purpose of understanding the organisation’s key strengths and key weaknesses, so that 
it can build on key strengths and counter or mitigate key weaknesses.  
LO 5: Explain strategy implementation and recognise strategic 
programmes, projects, the various drivers of strategy 
implementation and the operationalising of strategy in 
organisations.  
The purpose of strategy implementation is to align the internal and external environments 
with the chosen strategy. Strategy implementation is often seen as the most challenging 
stage in the strategic management process. A number of drivers exist for strat egy 
implementation. These include leadership, organisational culture, resource allocation, 
organisational structure and organisational learning.  
LO 6: Explain strategy review and control and identify the main strategic 
control mechanisms in organisations.  
Strategy review and control develop during this stage of the strategic management process. 
In this phase, the management uses a range of different measures and processes to check on 
the progress of the implementation process and monitors the need for chang es to some of 
the previously developed strategies and goals. The four main strategic control mechanisms 
are premise control, strategic surveillance, special alert control and 
implementation/execution control.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT

Chapter 3 explained the process perspective of strategic management. 
It also described the three stages in the strategic management 
process. In this chapter, we focus on strategising - the actions of 
strategists that influence the strategy of the organisation in much less 
formal, structured and interactive ways. It is important to note that 
organisations typically have (and should have) a formal strategic 
management process and our argument here is not that these 
processes are wrong. However, organisations should realise that 
strategic management is influenced by much more than just their 
formal processes. They should find ways of tapping into the more 
informal strategising activities within the organisation and using it to 
their advantage. The chapter will also discuss the strategic actors 
commonly found in organisations, and how they shape s trategy (the 
strategists).   
The case study describes Aspen Holdings' history and strategy that was 
formulated by the CEO, Stephen Saad and his team of managers. The 
opening case also describes Aspen’s deliberate strategy to inv est in 
capital projects, as well as their emergent strategy to enter the 
Australian market. This case proves that formulating strategies can be 
deliberate or emergent. In other words, organisations can have formal 
processes in which they think about and de cide what their strategy 
should be (deliberate strategy), while in other instances, the actions of 
strategists will lead to strategies emerging from the pattern of 
decisions (emergent strategy). The purpose of Chapter 4 is to describe 
the people involved i n strategy formulation, implementation and 
review. In short, this chapter will look at who the strategists are and 
how they strategise - specifically, the roles and responsibilities of the 
various strategists. There is a range of actors that participate an d 
influence the strategic activities in the organisation. The traditional 
approach to strategic management assigned specific roles to specific 
actors, but more contemporary approaches indicate that the roles are 
not as clear cut as traditionally proclaimed . For this chapter, we start 
off with a differentiation between a process and practice perspective of 
strategic management, followed by an explanation of the term 
‘strategising’. Then, we will differentiate between deliberate and 
emergent strategising. The  chapter concludes with a discussion of the 
various roles and responsibilities of strategists. Finally, the chapter 
offers concluding comments on the activity of strategising and who 
does it.

82 CHAPTER 4: STRATEGISING AND STRATEGISTS  
Case study  
Aspen - Strategising over 160 years  
The organisation known today as Aspen Pharmacare has a rich history that stretches over 
160 years. Berry Grey Lennon, a chemist from Ireland, settled in the Cape, South Africa, and 
opened a chemist and druggist in Port E lizabeth in 1850. Not only did he establish a 
household brand, but he also served as chief strategist to grow a company that has proven 
its ability to survive and thrive in a changing business environment. By 1858, Lennon 
advertised his products in the loc al press and they featured on the cover page of the first 
issue of the South African Medical Journal in 1884. From here on, the wholesale chemist 
expanded and incorporated as a public company in 1898 under the name Lennon Ltd. Today 
this is the Aspen Pharm acare Trading Company and continues to carry the 1898 registration 
number. By 1911, Lennon Ltd had 21 pharmacies across South Africa. During the years that 
followed, Lennon Ltd continued to grow and by 1930, it had established itself as the largest 
pharmac eutical company in the southern hemisphere. In 1968, the South African Druggist 
group, which included Lennon Ltd, listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. During the 
1970s, Lennon Ltd capitalised on the birth of the generic industry and focused on provid ing 
equivalent products on the expiry of patents. The establishment of the Lennon Ltd Research 
and Development department in 1975, led to the registration of a wide range of generic 
products. Through the 1980s and 1990s, Lennon Ltd became an undisputed lea der in the 
generics field.  
During 1997, from a converted house in Durban, Aspen Healthcare was founded by 
among others, Stephen Saad and Gus Attridge. Aspen was listed on the JSE through reverse 
listing into Medhold Ltd and by 1999, had acquired the South African Druggist group (which 
included Lennon Ltd). At that time, the South African Druggist group was the oldest 
pharmaceutical business in South Africa.  
Moving from strength to strength is what Aspen is known for - from establishing 
Aspen Australia in 20 01, to taking the lead in a broad -based economic empowerment deal in 
2002, to launching the first generic anti -retroviral drug in 2003, to constructing a state - of-
the-art facility in Port Elizabeth in 2004 (with two new facilities added in Port Elizabeth in 
2016 and 2018 and subsequent investments in manufacturing infrastructure currently taking 
place, to acquiring Fine Chemicals in Cape Town in 2004 ... the list continues.  
In 2002, Aspen Pharmacare launched its new corporate identity which has grown to 
accommodate nearly 50 business units across the world. Aspen remains one of South Africa's 
success stories and one of the top 40 companies listed on the JSE. Aspen is established as a 
global player and a leading speciality and branded multi -national pharmace utical company 
that provides treatment for a broad spectrum of acute and chronic health conditions 
experienced through all stages of life.  
In 2006, Aspen Holdings reported gross revenue of R3,4 billion - in 2018, the gross 
revenue was more than 10 times that, namely R42,6 billion, as released on 30 June 2018.  
83 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
The success of Lennon Ltd and the Aspen Group can arguably be ascribed to the vision and 
guidance of its leaders. Moreover, the de liberate attempts to stay ahead of the game has 
proven to be successful. Aspen and its leaders are committed to sustaining life and 
promoting healthcare through increasing access to its high -quality, affordable medicines and 
products.  
Stephen Saad - the st rategist  
As a strategist, co -founder and Group Chief Executive of Aspen, Saad is widely recognised for 
his astute leadership, passion, commitment and focus. There are many stories that testify to 
his out -of-the-box thinking while managing to stay focused on the end goal: continuous 
improvement of efficiencies and performance. One example of his strategising activities is 
from 2001, when Aspen expanded its operations to Australia with only two people and two 
laptops. Saad and his team followed a simple stra tegy to enter the Australian market: Aspen 
hired doctors, who had been forced to retire at ages 60 to 65, as sales representatives. They 
obtained access to practising doctors more readily than ordinary sales representatives did. 
They were rejuvenated and h ighly motivated.  
Aspen, under the leadership of Saad and his senior management team, continues to 
increase the number of lives benefiting from their products, reaching more than 150 
countries across the world. Aspen supplies products to more than 150 count ries, has 23 
manufacturing facilities at 15 sites on six continents and employs approximately 10 000 
people.  
In South Africa, Aspen was a driving force in the development of the Public Health 
Enhancement Fund, a three -year partnership between the public an d private health sector in 
South Africa, which invests millions of funds in assisting government to address a number of 
public healthcare priorities identified by the Department of Health.  
Saad's philosophy on strategising is evident in his commitment to t he company's 
employees. 'There's a basic value system we drive in the business. We give ownership and 
trust to our people and let them make many of the decisions. That's the biggest aspect to 
Aspen's success.' Saad also confirms that the company invests he avily in capital projects, 
which provide an important strategic advantage to the group by enabling it to add value to 
its expanding portfolio of products that require complex manufacturing processes.  
When asked about the ingredients of leadership, Saad sta ted 'Always understand 
where you come from and stay true to your roots. Remember how you treated clients with 
humility at the beginning and continue to show them the same respect that we have become 
known for.'  
Saad and his team are constantly on the looko ut for opportunities, challenges and 
competitor actions and build their strategies on a clear understanding of the past, which 
informs the future: 'Don't look back except to learn.' Saad also explains that perseverance 
has been the single most important co ntributor to what Aspen has achieved. He explains that 
another critical factor to his success as a strategist is a thorough understanding of the detail 
- having a thorough understanding of the environment, the operating conditions and all 
role-players.'  
84 CHAPTER 4: STRATEGISING AND STRATEGISTS  
On strategising, Saad confirmed that it is extremely important to have both a clear 
vision and a plan. He explains that it can change at any point but it must be both 
simple and understandable to all. 'Make sure you really understand the details of your 
business - the critical detail, then list five or six priorities and ensure that you and 
your team focus on those priorities.'  
He also advises surrounding yourself with people who are more competent  than 
you are in the areas they specialise in and that you should not be threatened by 
competence. ‘I believe that one of the critical factors for ensuring success is to trust 
those you have appointed to lead your businesses’  
Aspen offers shareholders a pr oven record of accomplishment. The company is 
widely recognised as being a responsible corporate citizen. Aspen remains globally 
competitive through its centralised regulatory, supply chain and procurement 
resources that provide a competitive advantage to the group. The ongoing focus on 
the continuous improvement of efficiencies and performance sets a strong foundation 
from which to operate.  
LO 1:  Differentiate  between  the process  and practice  perspectives  of strategic  
management.  
4.1 The process and practice perspectives of 
strategic management  
The traditional perspective of strategic management as a formal and rational process has 
attracted considerable criticism for various reasons. One of these is that the process 
perspective is limited and out of touch wit h the complexities of strategy as it happens in 
reality. On the one hand, it tends to regard strategies as being formulated through 
relatively formal structures and systems, with not much attention being given to the effects 
of interpersonal relations and political processes.1 Practice research and a practice -oriented 
perspective of strategic management, on the other hand, takes interpersonal relations and 
political processes into account and aims to understand the messy realities of how 
strategies are form ed. 
The process perspective of strategic management has its origins in the 1980s and 
processes are considered as sequences of individual and collective events, actions and 
activities developed over time. Although the process perspective initially gained su pport 
from many scholars, it was later criticised as being an approach that did not go far enough 
in attending to the actual micro -practices (the acts of strategists) and everyday routines of 
strategy crafting. Scholars and practitioners around the world c alled for a perspective on 
strategy that was more in touch with reality and acknowledged the various strategic actors, 
which are not limited to top managers only. While the process research took important 
steps forward humanising strategy research and gene rating more dynamic theories, the 
practice perspective takes it further. The practice approach is seen as necessary for 
researching the fundamental details of strategy making.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
The practice perspective in strategic management is known as the strategy -as-practice 
perspective. The key insight of strategy -as-practice studies is that strategy work 
(strategising) relies on organisational and other practices that significantly affect both the 
proce ss and the outcome of resulting strategies. Thus, the scope of the strategy - as-practice 
perspective is wider than just the strategy formulation process itself. The practice 
perspective focuses on social practices as the basis for explaining strategy emerg ence. It 
seeks to identify the strategic activities reiterated in time by the diverse actors interacting 
in an organisational context.2 The strategy -as-practice perspective is concerned with the 
detailed aspects of strategising - how strategists think, tal k, reflect, act, interact, emote, 
embellish, politicise, which tools and technologies they use, and the implications of 
different forms of strategising for strategy as an organisational activity. The practice 
perspective is also concerned with what people do less often during board meetings, 
strategy breakaways and other occurrences. Strategy -as-practice researchers recognise the 
complexity of the process and the potential influence of organisational members, not only 
through formal organisational processes , but also in everyday activities.3 The strategy -as-
practice research field is not only focused on the micro activities, but also on the context 
within which these micro -activities take place.  
The strategy -as-practice perspective supports and builds on the  strategy process 
perspective and views strategy as a situated, socially accomplished activity - meaning that 
it is done by people and influenced by their background and context. It refers to activities 
that are connected with particular practices such as strategic planning, annual reviews, 
strategy workshops and their associated discussions.  
The strategy -as-practice perspective distinguishes between strategy praxis (the 
work), strategy practitioners (the workers) and strategy practices (the tools). Figure 4.2 
depicts the conceptual framework that forms the foundation of the strategy -as- practice 
perspective.  
The three elements of praxis, practices and practitioners, depicted in Figure 4.2, are 
discrete but interrelated social phenomena. It is thus not possi ble to study one without also 
drawing on aspects of the others.

Strategising  
 
Figure 4.2 A conceptual framework of the strategy -as-practice perspective4 
86 CHAPTER 4: STRATEGISING AND STRATEGIST S 
Strategising occurs at the nexus between praxis, practices and practitioners. A, B and C 
represent stronger foci on one of these interconnections depending on the research problem 
to be addressed. What this means in practical terms is that the act of str ategising (or 
strategy making) happens when practitioners (such as the CEO, the business consultant or 
the board of directors) use strategy tools and processes (such as the SWOT analysis or the 
balanced scorecard) during, for example, a strategy workshop. But, the practice perspective 
also takes this deliberate strategising further: the act of strategising is not always situated 
in a formal setting - often strategising emerges as the organisation and its managers cope 
with changes in the environment and occ urring as individuals or groups act in ways that 
influence the organisation in profound ways.  
¦ Prajds is linked to human action and encompasses ‘all the various activities involved in 
the deliberate formulation and implementation of strategy’.5 In everyday terms, praxis 
refers to the flow of activities such as meeting, consulting, talking, calculating, 
writing, presenting, communicating, completing documents, and so on, that are 
employed to constitute strategies.6 
¦ Practices are the social, symbo lic and material tools through which strategy work is 
done. These tools are combined, co -ordinated and adapted to construct strategy 
practice, and include theoretically and practically derived tools such as Porter’s five 
forces of competition, a SWOT analy sis, resource -based view analysis and value 
chains, as well as material artefacts and technologies such as PowerPoint, flipcharts, 
and spreadsheets.7 Because of the unique characteristics of organisations, their 
managers and employees and the underlying or ganisational culture, practices are 
diverse and variable, which means that no single approach to strategy formulation and 
implementation is correct for all organisations. Organisations customise their 
strategising practices to suit their circumstances.  
¦ Practitioners, or strategists, are the actors - the individuals who draw upon practices to 
act. In this book, we prefer to use the term ‘strategists’. Practitioners/ strategists are 
interrelated with practices and praxis. They derive agency through their use of the 
practices, namely, ways of behaving, thinking, emoting, knowing and acting prevalent 
within their society, combining, co -ordinating and adapting the practices to suit their 
needs in order to act within and influence that society.8 
As alluded to earl ier, we accept that strategy is not only a deliberate, top -down process. 
Middle managers and operational -level employees are also important strategic actors or 
strategists. While their actions and influence on strategy may be unintended on an 
organisation level, middle managers and operational -level employees are significant for 
organisational survival and competitive advantage. In this book, we identify and discuss a 
wider range of actors as strategists, going beyond top managers to include other levels of  
employees, as well as the board of directors and consultants.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
LO 2:  Explain  theterm ‘strategising'.  
4.2 Strategising  
Strategising is essentially what strategists do, and can be described as devising or 
influencing strategies. Through their actions, strategists influence the allocation of the 
organisation’s resources and control or influence key actions. The terms ‘strategising’ and 
‘strategy -making’ are often used interchangeably and include strategising activities. 
Strategising not only involves those inside the organisation, but also consulting firms, 
business schools, business media, academic journals, professional societies, enterprises and 
management in a joint endeavour that all recognis e as somehow strategic.9 For example, 
when we look at the case study, Stephen Saad, CEO of Aspen, clearly influences key 
actions of the organisation. But he does not do this on his own: he specifically refers to 
those who are appointed to lead the business , that is, the managers. The case also describes 
Aspen’s deliberate strategy as a growth strategy that led the organisation into new markets 
and product ranges. The next level of strategies may be more emergent in nature as an 
organisation’s strategy is pa rtly proactive and partly reactive. The following section 
describes strategising from a deliberate strategy and emergent strategy perspective.  
LO 3:  Differentiate  between  deliberate  and emergent  strategising.  
4.3 Deliberate and emergent strategising  
As explain ed in earlier chapters, strategy deals with what the organisation plans to do and 
achieve in the future. Strategic thinking entails an analytic and logical approach to 
establishing the future direction of the organisation and the action plans to achieve it . In 
Chapter 3, we explained that the process of strategic management comprises three distinct 
stages: planning, implementation and review. This implies that before a strategy can be 
implemented, it needs to be crafted. However, often, organisations find t hemselves in a 
situation in which so much change has taken place between formulating and 
implementation, that the strategy needs reconsideration and/or alteration. Despite basing 
strategic decisions on a range of assumptions that were logically and concept ually 
developed, change can render the strategies obsolete, or force organisations to formulate 
strategies during the implementation process.  
Deliberate strategies  are implemented and realised as intended. In order for this to 
happen, three conditions need  to be satisfied:  
1. The management team must know precisely what they wish to achieve and what 
they intend for the future of the organisation before any actions are taken.  
2. Organisation means collective action. All members of the organisation must 
believe in the strategy and work towards it.  
88 CHAPTER 4: STRATEGISING AND STRATEGISTS  
3. The strategy must be realised exactly as intended, with no external interference.10 
This is difficult given the pace of change in the contemporary business 
envir onment.  
For a strategy to be emergent, it may develop outside the original intentions of the original 
strategic plan. This does not mean that an organisation intentionally ignores the original 
strategic plan - rather, it is a rethinking of strategy that is  necessitated by immediate 
circumstances. Thus, strategy may suddenly be rationalised to mean something very 
different from what was originally intended.11 Emergent strategies  are actions taken by 
middle managers and other strategists within the organisati on outside of the formal and 
deliberate strategic management processes. Middle managers are more involved with the 
operations of the organisation and are able to make changes to the strategies when 
required. This means that some strategic initiatives may a rise initially without the 
awareness of the senior management team. Emergent strategy implies learning what works - 
taking one action at a time in search of that viable pattern or consistency. It is also 
frequently the means by which deliberate strategies change. This does not mean that the 
senior management team loses control, but rather that strategies are open, flexible and 
responsive to allow the organisation to learn and adapt to its environment. Emergent 
strategising enables management to act before e verything is fully understood. It enables the 
senior management team, who cannot be close enough to a situation or who cannot know 
enough about the varied activities of its organisation, to surrender control to those middle -
level managers who have enough c urrent and detailed information to shape realistic 
strategies. Whereas the more deliberate strategies tend to emphasise central direction and 
hierarchy, the more emergent strategies open the way for collective action and convergent 
behaviour. The approach of this book is that strategic and strategising decisions are not 
only a way of making sense of an emergent pattern of activity, but also a way of creating 
sense in the absence of any such patterns, as a response to the anxieties of the human 
condition or to the uncertainties with which managers are characteristically faced.12 
Strategic decisions cannot always await consensus, commitment or visible action. When 
existing strategies are no longer convincing, the decision complexes associated with them 
cease t o be effective carriers of meaning, and new rationalisations of the world in the form 
of new decisions, however provisional, must be constructed in their place.  
All management levels and employees have specific roles to fulfil in ensuring 
successful strategising. Often, a disconnect exists between the perspectives of the various 
role-players. For example, the senior management team of the organisation decides, aft er a 
strategic review, to launch a new strategy. This new strategy involves a range of 
commitments, most of which have already been made, either in anticipation of the decision 
or in reactive response to market pressures (deliberate strategising). Many of the 
commitments agreed upon are modified along the way (emergent strategy) and at least one 
major part of the strategy is never implemented at all (unrealised strategy). Accordingly, 
the strategy of the organisation changes and the change is reflected both  in management 
thinking and in the organisation’s dctions and behaviours. The next section focuses on the 
roles and responsibilities of strategists or strategy practitioners.  
89 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
LO 4:  Explai n the roles  and responsibilities  of strategists.  
4.4 Strategists  
A strategist is the ‘doer’ of the strategy. Whereas top managers have traditionally been 
regarded as the custodians of strategy, the idea that other people and even objects 
(artefacts) can also be strategists is gaining ground. Any individual or group in the 
organisation that controls key or precedent -setting actions13 (for example, middle managers 
and strategy consultants) can be regarded as strategists. Since objects can also control or 
influen ce key actions, we can extend this definition to include presentations, written 
documents, information systems, and so on.  
By accepting that strategists are not only from the top management echelons - or 
even appointed as strategists, we then also need to look at the different categories of 
strategists. For example, within the middle management level, individuals may exist that 
offer a range of skills that make them strategists and enable them to do strategy. 
Hodgkinson and Clarke14 found that individual st rategists will, cognitively speaking, fall 
into one of four broad types: detail -conscious, big -picture conscious, non -discerning and 
cognitively versatile. Bear in mind that the complexity of the environment, the size of the 
organisation, the experience le vels of the managers and workers all influence the skills 
needed by strategists. Often strategists who fall within a combination of these categories 
are best suited to the unique circumstances in which the organisation finds itself. These 
categories of str ategists are described in Table 4.1.  
Table 4.1 Category of strategists  
Strategists  Description  
Detail -conscious 
strategy workers  P-actitioners who are detail -conscious are highly analytic and driven 
by the minutiae of available data, with little or no regard for 
intuition. They have a tendency to approach problems in a step -by-
step, systematic fashion.  
Big picture -conscious 
strategy workers  Practitioners who are big -picture conscious can become preoccupied 
with gaining an overview of the problem at the  expense of the 
details. They are highly intuitive in orientation, with little or no 
regard for analytic approaches to problem solving and decision -
making.  
Non -discerning strategy 
workers  Non -discerning practitioners deploy minimal cognitive resources in 
order to derive strategic insight, being disinclined to process the 
detail or to extract a bigger picture from such detail. They rely on 
opinion and wisdom received from others and thereby relieve 
themselves of the burdens of analytic and intuitive process ing 
altogether.  CHAPTER 4: STRATEGISING AND STRATEGISTS  
Strategists  Description  
Cognitively versatile 
strategy workers  These practitioners possess in equal abundance the inclination to 
attend to analytical detail and cut through that detail, as and when 
required. This type of practitioner is able to switch more readily 
between analytic and intuitive processing strategies.  
Various strategists, both internal and external, that influence organisational performance 
and strategic success are discussed below.  
4.4.1  Top managers as strategists  
The role of the top management team is to set the overall strategic direction of the 
organisation by formulating' the strategy, allocating the resources and reviewing the 
strategic success. They are responsi ble for gathering information from both the internal and 
external environment, and choosing strategies and actions to help the organisation gain a 
sustainable competitive advantage. They communicate this to middle -level management, 
explaining the rationale  behind their strategic choices so that middle managers can link the 
strategies and strategic goals to implementation efforts.  
The top managers are also responsible for the review of strategies. They reflect upon 
their decisions and actions and this may lead to changes or new decisions and actions. 
Sensing or sense -making may also lead to new insights or realisations and may affect 
current or future decisions. The case study showed that the Aspen CEO, Stephen Saad, 
regularly looked towards what happened i n the past in order to learn from it. He also 
explained that organisational plans can change at any point and how important it is to 
understand the details of the business. Saad confirmed the importance of a thorough 
understanding of the environment, the o perating conditions and all role -players.  
A strategist who is responsible for guiding the strategic planning in an organisation 
is often referred to as a ‘strategic planning champion’ (SPC)15. An SPC is an expert in 
strategic thinking with specific analyti cal and technical skills, including the ability and 
knowledge to apply strategic management concepts to the organisation and use 
management tools and planning models for strategic practices. There are three roles that 
SPCs must perform to work effectively - some strategists may be stronger in a specific role 
while others may offer a combination of these roles or have these roles fulfilled by 
members of their management team. Listed below are the three roles that SPCs must 
perform:  
¦ The social craftsperson in tegrates different expectations from groups and 
individuals to ensure buy -in into the overall strategic direction, creating a 
positive and common ground from which to plan the strategic future of the 
organisation. He or she deals with tensions and conflict s, and changes a volatile 
situation into a positive one.  
91  
PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
¦ The artful interpreter adjusts general strategic planning practices to align them 
with the local routines and norms. He or she contextualises the strategy so that 
others can identify their own roles in it.  
¦ The known stranger ensures a balance between distance and closeness in the 
interaction between strategists and other parties to maintain objectivity while at 
the same time c ultivating trust.  
The senior or top management team needs to have sufficient detail of the organisation to 
ensure that the strategising is sound and to be able to allocate scarce resources to put the 
strategies in place. The practising strategy box below, illustrates the strategising abilities 
of one of South Africa’s top business leaders, Sizwe Nxasana.  
Practising strategy: Sizwe Nxasana, 
FirstRand group  
Sizwe Nxasana has an illustrious career and served in three different industries where he 
made a marked  difference.  
He started by establishing Sizwe 8t Co, the first black -owned audit practice in Kwazulu -
Natal. In 1996, he became the founding partner of NkonkiSizweNtsaluba, the first black -
owned national firm of accountants, where he remained until March 1998. The firm is now 
the fifth largest audit firm in South Africa. He left to join Telkom SA as Chief Executive 
Officer in 1998.16 He turned Telkom around in the seven years that he served as CEO - 
changing it from a struggling state -owned enterprise to a  formidable ICT company.  
He joined the FirstRand Group and led the group to record highs. Under his leadership, 
FNB has implemented affordable methods that people can use to do their banking in the 
convenience of their homes. For instance, he said, looking  at cellphone banking, there are 
solutions for all people across the board.17 
4.4.2  Board of directors as strategists  
Boards of directors of companies, being the focal point and custodians for corporate 
governance, influence strategising in organisations. Althou gh strategic decision making is 
done by senior management, the board of directors influences the overall direction and 
monitors the relationship between management and other stakeholders to ensure that the 
organisation is sustainable in the long term (refe r to Chapter 1, Section 1.6, where we 
distinguished between the terms ‘shareholder’ and stakeholder'). Historically, boards of 
directors focused on strategy once annually, often at a one -to- two-day off -site workshop or 
lekgotla.  New trends indicate a chan ge in this practice where board meetings become a 
discussion on strategy to ensure that appropriate progress is being made and that new 
competition or technology is being assessed in a fast -changing business environment.  
92  
CHAPTER 4: STRATEGISING AND STRATEGISTS  
In South Africa, the King III Report on Corporate Governance and the King IV report on 
Corporate Governance for South Africa18 offer principles to oversee the functions and role 
of the board of directors. One of these princi ples requires the board to ensure that strategy 
be aligned with the purpose of the organisation. The board is also responsible for the 
appointment of a chief executive officer. It provides leadership by endorsing the chief 
executive officer to lead the pro cess of strategy crafting. The role of the board is more 
aligned to monitoring and reviewing strategies than crafting them. However, the consulting 
firm, McKinsey, surveyed board members to learn where they would most like to spend 
additional time and 66 p er cent of the board members surveyed indicated they want to spend 
more time on strategy, and less time on compliance -related topics.19 The practising strategy 
box below, illustrates the roles of the Board of Directors at Woolworths Holdings Limited.  
Pract ising strategy: Woolworths Holdings 
Limited (WHL)20 
The board process at Woolworths Holdings Limited is managed by the company secretary. 
The board and board committees meet on a quarterly basis and the board engages with 
management on performance against the strategy on a quarterly basis.  
Woolworths has three operating subsidiaries - Country Road Group, Woolworths 
and David Jones. Woolworths acquired the Australian department chain store, David Jones 
in 2014. The other Australian retail chain in the Woolwo rths portfolio is Country Road 
that contributed 16 per cent to its revenue in 2017.21 
The executive committees of Woolworths, David Jones and the Country Road 
Group oversee operational governance and meet monthly. Each business unit has a 
leadership team that reviews the strategic objectives and capital initiatives and assesses 
the risks and opportunities within their unit.  
The various board committees report back to the board on how they carried out 
their responsibilities. The committees assess their mand ates annually as documented in 
their respective terms of reference and undertake internal reviews of their effectiveness. 
WHL board meetings are held on a regular basis in Australia to ensure that directors 
receive adequate exposure to the Australian retai l market and the dynamics within which 
the WHL Group operates.  
Board role and function  
The WHL board is guided by a charter that is reviewed annually. The charter includes a 
delegation of authority, which sets out the delegation of matters by the board to its 
committees and the Chief Executive Officer. There are a number of governance policies 
that complement the delegation of authority. These policies are reviewed annually, and the 
board approves all amendments.  
93 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
4.4.3  Middle managers as strategists  
Traditionally, the role of middle managers was seen to be limited to implementation. 
However, in the flattened organisational structure, middle management is now much closer 
to the strategic apex and makes a variety of contributions. Consequently, the new model of 
the middle manager is one that has a more strategic focus.  
Four strategic roles of middle managers have  been identified These include:22 
1. Implementing deliberate strategy. This role  is aligned  to the traditional  
view of strategic management, but remains valid in the contemporary business 
organisation, especially in relation to deliberate strategies. It deals with 
managerial interventions, actions and tasks to align the organisational action with 
the strategic intentions of top management. Middle managers’ abilities to 
understand, anticipate and manage the processes needed to secure positive and 
pervasive commitment to strategy is a critical general management 
implementation skill. Middle mana gers implement strategy by translating 
corporate strategy into action plans and individual objectives.  
2. Synthesising information. This refers to the interpretation and evaluation  
of information. How middle managers understand and share information 
influence s the success or failure of organisational strategies. Not only do middle 
managers provide information concerning internal and external events to top 
managers, but they are also responsible for passing information down to 
subordinates, which can reduce unc ertainty and resistance to change. This flow of 
information forms a  valuable  foundation for management  
decision -making. Middle managers  combine  strategic macro -information  
and hands -on micro -information.  
3. Reshaping the strategic thinking of top management by selling to them strategic 
initiatives that diverge from their current conception of strategy. This role links 
with emergent strategising. Middle managers frequently become organisational 
champions for initiatives developed at the operating level. This r ole is distinct 
from product championing as it centres on influencing corporate management to 
adjust their current concept of strategy. It is defined as the persistent and 
persuasive communication of strategic options to top management.23 By 
proposing and defining issues for top managers, middle managers provide 
important contributions to an organisation’s strategic direction and thereby 
influence organisational effectiveness.24 
4. Managing change and facilitating adaptability. Middle managers have downward 
influence and need to support, guide and alleviate the concerns and fears of 
subordinates. Formulating and implementing strategies go hand in hand with 
change, and middle managers play an important role in managing these change 
processes by adapting and amen ding work practices to align them to the changing 
environment. Middle managers are also required to deal with conflict. Within 
their areas of responsibility, middle managers have the authority and 
responsibility to facilitate change.  
94 CHAPTER 4: STRATEGISING AND STRATEGISTS  
Middle managers contribute in various ways to strategising. Middle managers should be 
clear thinkers and be good at identifying what needs to be done and then guiding their 
subordinates to get it done.  
4.4.4  Consultants as strategists  
The management consulting industry is considered to be one of the most powerful forces 
shaping organisational strategy. Management consultants are practitioners who are 
considered knowledgeable about the business environment and organisations. They have a 
wealth of industiy contacts and good reputations based on experience. The practising 
strategy box below describes Deloitte Consulting’s philosophy in helping organisations 
craft and execute strategies.  
Guidance from outside the organisation is often sought, especially when managers 
inside the organisation lack expertise in a specific area, or when decision making has come 
to a standstill. Furthermore, when an organisation experiences short - to medium -term 
staffing issues, consultants can fill th e role of full -time employees. Most importantly, 
management consulting firms pool their resources, knowledge and experiences across 
industries and are authoritative forces in advising on best practices.  
Practising strategy: Deloitte Consulting  
Helping orga nisations innovate, transform, and lead  
'As the world's largest management consulting business, Deloitte is distinct in its 
ability to help clients solve their most complex problems, from strategy to 
implementation. We are differentiated by our capability to execute the advice we 
provide to help clients in the markets where they operate today and where they want to 
be in the future. Delivering this kind of value requires the skills to integrate a broad 
range of talent and skills - across human capital, stra tegy and operations, and 
technology - aligned to the unique needs of our clients’ industry sectors, businesses, 
and organizations'.25 
'That is where Monitor Deloitte excels. Our strategy practice takes a 21st - century 
approach to strategy that, combined with our deep industry experience, positions us to 
collaborate with you to create executable strategies. Unlike our competitors, we can 
see strategy through to implementation and, as a result, increase our impact. It is an 
approach that can help organizati ons move more quickly and pragmatically to take 
advantage of new opportunities while helping to mitigate risks along the way. And it 
can work for your business'.26 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
4.4.5  Individuals as strategists  
From the strategy -as-practice perspective strategising activities are operationalised at 
different levels from the organisational to the individual. Strategising happens in a dynamic 
space through interactions between workers on different levels. From the  preceding 
sections, it should be clear that we not only consider the top managers to be the strategists, 
but confirm that the doers of strategy are found on all levels of the organisation. In fact, 
there may be strategists on the lowest level of the organ isation as the immediate 
environment calls for swift reaction to changes in the business environment. It may be 
argued that the nature of the strategic work on the lower levels of management is mostly 
emergent and more operational in nature. When we break down strategy work on an 
individual level, we appreciate the micro -level strategising. Yet, the work of these 
individuals ought to be recognised in shaping the overall strategy.  
Strategic success is enhanced by the collective efforts of all the strategists . Success 
is enhanced, or limited, by the quality of the strategists and the degree to which they work 
together in sharing information, debating ways to make strategic and operating 
improvements, and joining forces to solve problems. Strategists differ in their management 
styles, skills, values, attitudes, willingness to take risks, perception of success, concern for 
social responsibility, short -term versus long -term orientation and ethics.  
The big picture  
In this chapter, we get a glimpse of the complexity  of strategy formation. On the one hand, 
there is the process perspective of strategic management that considers strategy formation 
as a formal process with specific management roles and tasks assigned to each stage in the 
process. On the other hand, the p ractice perspective offers a broader view of strategic 
management that not only considers a wider range of strategists (such as the board of 
directors, top managers, middle managers and consultants), but also allows for the messy 
realities of doing strateg y in practice. Both approaches are present in most organisations.  
Within the strategy -as-practice perspective, strategising is the result of the 
interaction between strategy praxis, strategy practices and strategists. Formulating and 
implementing strategie s should be proactive in nature, but due to the changing business 
environment, some strategies are reactive. Deliberate and emergent strategising is 
influenced by the business environment and the strategy practices and strategists. 
Deliberate strategies te nd to emphasise central direction and hierarchy, while the more 
emergent ones open the way for collective action and convergent behaviour.  
96 CHAPTER 4: STRATEGISING AND STRATEGISTS  
Summary of learning outcomes  
LO 1: Differentiate between  a process and a practice perspective of 
strategic management.  
The process perspective is a traditional approach to strategic management that follows a 
mostly linear process that is driven by the top management team and divided into three 
distinct stages o r phases.  
The practice perspective of strategic management recognises the complexities of 
strategic management in reality and recognises that strategic management is not a linear 
process. The perspective is concerned with the detailed aspects of strategisi ng by looking 
at how and why strategy is done and by whom.  
LO 2: Explain the term 'strategising'.  
Strategising is the act of making strategy and happens when practitioners use strategy tools 
and processes to develop, implement, review and do strategy.  
LO 3: Differentiate between deliberate and emergent strategising.  
The difference between deliberate and emergent strategising lies in the formality, the 
people involved, the duration and the central direction. Emergent strategising takes place 
outside the for mal strategic planning sessions and is deemed open, flexible and responsive 
to the environment. Deliberate strategising is more formal and originate from specific 
interventions and hierarchy.  
LO 4: Explain the roles and responsibilities of strategists.  
Strategists are found throughout the organisation, as well as outside of them. Different 
levels of managers, the board of directors, external consultants and individuals on micro -
level form part of the group of strategists in an organisation. The involvement and 
responsibilities may differ between these strategists, but ultimately each has a role in the 
doing of strategy.

The environment is what gives organisations their means of survival. In 
Chapter 1 (Section 1.6) we indicated that organisations source inputs 
from the environment, transform that into outputs, which is then given 
back to the environment. The success of an organisation as a system is 
largely determined by its successful interactions with the environment. 
Structurally, the management environment can be divided into the 
micro -, market and remote environments. This chapter focus on the 
market and remote environments.  Our case study 'Uber come s to Africa', paints a picture of the 
traditional metered taxi industry that faces new competition since Uber 
entered the market. The world of business is characterised by 
competition and unpredictability, and it is essential for strategists, 
organisations  and industries to adapt and be responsive to changes in 
its environment and not to depend on their successes of the past. A 
dependence of successes of the past will be devastating with far - 
reaching implications.  
The effect of the environment on organisat ions and their 
strategic choices should not be underestimated or considered lightly. 
Instead, organisations and industries must be able to respond quickly 
to changing circumstances posing as threats and opportunities, and 
alter their strategies accordingly  as they strive for a strategic fit 
between their organisation and the environment.  
Strategy is thus context -specific and while each organisation 
has unique internal and external contexts, the primary focus of this 
chapter will be on the external context, in other words, the 
environment outside the boundaries of the organisation, called the 
external (or macro -) environment. The external environment comprises 
two sub -environments, namely, the market and remote environments, 
which were explained in Chapter 1 (Section 1.6). Understanding these 
environments and their strategic context is vital to making strategic 
choices that will guide and direct the organisation. While the previous 
chapters focused more on how strategy is crafted, this chapter 
provides importa nt tools that strategists can use to gain insight into 
the strategic context of their organisations and develop a strategic 
perspective of the organisation and its environment. Figure 5.1 depicts 
the focus of this chapter in relation to the broader strateg ic 
management process.  
In this chapter, we will first explain the external environment in 
the context of strategic management. Second, an explanation will be 
provided for the importance of strategic context in strategic planning 
and decision -making. Third,  an analysis of the remote environment for 
the purposes of identifying the opportunities and threats facing an 
organisation will be addressed. Then, attention will be given to the 
analysis of the market environment, in order to identify opportunities 
and t hreats to an organisation. Lastly, strategic responses to a 
changing external environment will be explained.

Case study  
Uber comes to South Africa  
There was a time, in the early days of motorised transport, when ears were not allowed to 
drive faster than 6.4km per hour and commercial motor vehicles were not allowed on public 
roads unless someone carrying a red flag walked in front of it. These were among a series of 
draconian laws enacted in Britain and parts of the USA from the mid -1860s, reportedly 
backed by railr oad barons who were scared of the competition posed by the new founded 
'road locomotives’.1 
Some 120 years later, a similar battle is playing itself out on the streets of cities in 
South Africa. This time, the disruptor is the ride -hailing smartphone appli cation, Uber, and 
the part of the rail barons is being played by the traditional metered -taxi industry.2 Uber 
launched in South Africa in 2012 and has since redefined the traditional industry model for 
taxi operators. The Table 5.1 lists various consumer a nd competitor dimensions of the taxi 
industry and compares the traditional metered taxi and the Uber taxi in terms of these 
dimensions.

Consumer and

of the taxi industry  Traditional metered 
South African taxis  Uber taxis  
Reserving a taxi  Customers wander the 
streets looking for a 
cab or wait at a depot 
or call a central office 
and wait.  Customers connect to the  Uber 
application on smartphones and reserve 
a taxi.  
The taxi ride  The main aim of the 
taxi driver is to get the 
customer to his or her 
destination.  Taxi drivers perform their best since 
they are aware that services are rated 
and poor service rendered will 
influence future business.  
Payment method  The taxi meter or the 
route travelled, 
determines the price 
charged by the 
metered taxi. 
Customers pay 
metered taxi drivers in 
cash.  The cost of using Uber is debited from 
the customer's bank account and no 
cash payments are necessary. Uber 
calculates the price by taking the 
following into account:3 
(i) base fare: the price for pick up;  
(ii) time: from start to the end of the 
trip; (iii) distance: kilometres of the 
route travelled; (iv) surge price (if 
applicable); an d (v) tolls and other 
fees (if applicable). The base fare, time 
and distance rates will differ 
depending on the vehicle option 
chosen by the customer and the city.  
After the taxi ride  Services rendered are 
not rated.  The customer rates the driver and the 
driver can improve his or her 
reputation for future customers.  
Uber (a software development organisation) has experienced explosive growth around the 
world since it was founded in San Francisco in the USA in 2009 with just a single car. A 
valuation of Ube r in February 2018 estimated it at a staggering US$72 billion (approximately 
R850 billion at the average US$/Rand exchange rate of R11.80 at the time of the valuation).  
Hostility to Uber  
Mention the word Uber  and it is bound to set off a range of comments. Despite consumer 
willingness to try out and adopt Uber, it has run into obstacles in a number of its markets, 
both in developed and developing countries. The South African metered taxi companies and 
taxi ope rators are fighting back, co -ordinating protest marches and calling on the 
government to clamp down on Uber, which they accuse of flouting the laws that regulate  
104 CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
public transport. Uber drive rs are also intimidated by other metered taxi drivers claiming 
that Uber is stealing their business and operating illegally. However, more often than not, 
people who make use of Uber did not previously use metered cab taxis4 and Uber flourishes 
globally.  
LO 1: Explain  the external  environment  in the context  of strategic  management.  
5.1 The external environment in the context of 
strategic management  
No organisation exists within a vacuum, and organisations should always be viewed as 
open systems - influenced by changes in its environment. For example, new trends in 
technology, nature and society are slowly revolutionising the business environment on a 
global and unprecedented scale5 - no organisation can escape these changes as was also 
illustrated in the case st udy. This ‘globality’ is characterised by greater interconnectedness 
and interdependencies between countries and organisations. These forces emanating from 
the external environment exert an enormous amount of influence on organisations. 
Strategists in orga nisations are therefore required to respond appropriately to changes in 
their remote environments. Furthermore, as industry players, they should be able to adapt 
or actively change their market environments to enhance their competitive positions and 
surviv e.6 
‘Going green’, ‘eco -friendly’ and ‘sustainable practices’ are now commonly 
accepted and are more than just buzz words or jargon. One of the aims of Uber, as 
discussed in the case study, is to improve the transportation ecosystem, proving itself as an 
organisation concerned about the natural environment. A growing number of customers, 
employees, investors and other stakeholders are demanding that organisations behave 
‘responsibly’ in terms of the natural environment (where the natural environment is only  
one of the variables in the external environment). As such, a new compact between 
business and society is being advocated where ‘business as usual’ is no longer an option. 
The term ‘compact’ refers to an agreement between various parties.  The agreement is  the 
decision, approval and acceptance of a new arrangement/relationship (whether formal or 
informal) which is being advocated between business and society in general. The United 
Nations Global Compact (UNGC), for example, is a call to organisations around  the world 
to align their strategies and operations with ten universal principles. These principles are 
human rights, labour, the environment and anti -corruption. Three specific principles were 
formulated for the environment theme, where the ‘environment’ refers to the physical or 
natural environment (as a variable in the remote environment of organisations). First, 
organisations should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. 
Second, organisations should undertake initiatives to promot e greater environmental 
responsibility. Lastly, organisations should encourage the development and diffusion of 
environmentally friendly technologies.7 
105  
PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Historically, the business world has primarily always considered internal stakeholders 
(such as business owners, investors, employees and management) in developing strategy. 
Business is now increasingly under pressure to deal comprehensively with external 
stakeholders (such as the c ommunity, government, activist groups, competitors, the media, 
and so on) as well (you may refer back to the explanation of the classification of 
stakeholders in Chapter 1, Section 1.7). Therefore, a profound understanding of the 
external environment gaine d through knowledge of the interests and influence of key 
external stakeholders is paramount to strategic decision -making and planning, and is 
recognised as a source of strategic value.8 
The context within which organisations exist is defined by their mark ets and remote 
environments. Figure 5.2 depicts the organisation and its environment, consisting of the 
micro -environment (over which management has control) and its market - and remote 
environments (over which management has no control).

Figure 5.2 The organisation and its environment  
Two levels of the analysis of the macro -/external environment, that will influence the 
organisation’s strategic direction and strategic actions, can be identified, namely:  
1. Analysis of the remote environment. This analysis focuses on the identification 
and forecasting of trends pertaining to political, economic, socio -cultural, 
technological, legal, environmental (or natural) and global variables.  
 
106 CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
2. Analysis of the market environment. This analysis focuses on the key role - 
players in this environment (such as customers, competitors, the labour market 
and unions, intermediaries and suppliers), along with the factors and conditions 
influencing an industry’s profit potential.  
Although these analyses will be discussed separately in this chapter, performanc e is likely 
to improve when the organisation integrates the results of both analyses.9 The analysis of 
the remote and market environments will be explained in more detail in Sections 5.3 and 
5.4 of this chapter.  
LO 2:  Explain  the importance of strategic co ntext in strategic planning and  
decision -making.  
5.2 The importance of strategic context in strategic 
planning and decision -making  
The boundaries and interfaces that exist between organisations and the external 
environment are relatively fluid and cannot be defined easily or clearly. As a result, 
unexpected changes in the external environment may occur from time to time, and 
strategists need to be prepared to react to these changes. Under such conditions, timely and 
accurate information about the environment is critical for strategic decision -making and 
planning. For example, if organisations know very little about the preferences of their 
customers and their future trends, they will have difficulty designing new products and/or 
services, setting up a producti on schedule, or developing strategic and marketing plans.  
However, the reality is that strategists often do not have enough information about 
the external environment readily available. They are operating in turbulent industries and 
can be challenged even further when they have to operate under conditions of rapid change 
and uncertainty. Strategists are not only constrained by a lack of information about the 
environment, but also by a limited ability to understand and predict the future.  
Ideally, for strate gic decision -making and planning to be effective, strategists must 
not only understand the context of their current management environments, but also the 
context of their future management environments.  
An organisation’s success is, to a certain extent, de termined by the characteristics of 
the industry in which it exists and the market for which it competes. Furthermore, different 
industries are characterised by different competitive conditions and dynamics. Hence, when 
viewed in relation to competitors, as  well as to competitive threats  and opportunities  
existing in the external environment, all organisations have inherent strengths  and 
weaknesses  and are exposed to external threats  and opportunities:10 
107 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
¦ Strengths are internal organisational resources and capabilities that can lead to a 
competitive advantage (Chapter 1, Section 1.8 provides an explanation of 
competitive advantage).  
¦ Weaknesses are  internal resources  and capabilities that an organisation may  
not possess yet but are necessary, resulting in competitive disadvantage  
until the organisation acquires them.  
¦ Opportunities are conditions in the external environment that allow an  
organisation to  take advantage  of organisational strengths, overcome  
weaknesses, and/or neutralise environmental threats.  
¦ Threats are conditions in the external environment that may stand in the way of 
organisational competitiveness or the achievement of stakeholder satisfaction.  
If strategists do not un derstand the strategic context, in other words, how the external 
environment affects their organisations, their ability to make decisions, formulate and 
execute plans will be severely limited.11 When studying the organisation in relation to its 
external en vironment and key role -players in this environment, strategists should:  
¦ take advantage  of inherent or  internal strengths and the identified  
opportunities arising from the external environment  
¦ overcome inherent weaknesses, or neutralise identified threats found in the 
external environment in order to ensure the strategic ‘fit’ or consistency between 
the opportunities and threats in the external environment and the strengths and 
weaknesses in the internal environment.  
Strategic direction is an outcome of mel ding the desires and expectations of key 
organisational stakeholders with environmental realities.12 Therefore, a profound 
understanding of the external environment, coupled with an understanding of its key role -
players, is paramount to charting an organis ation’s road to success. Understanding the 
external strategic context should lead to the identification of strategic alternatives and 
provide a basis for crafting strategies, as well as providing the organisation with a 
foundation for all other tasks of st rategic management. The next section focuses on the 
remote environment, as a sub -environment of the external (or macro -) environment.  
LO 3:  Analyse  the remote  environment  to identify  opportunities  and threats  facing  
an organisation.  
5.3 Analysing the remote environment  
To a large extent, organisations can only respond to the fundamental forces arising from 
the remote environment. While individual organisations can exert some influence over their 
market environments, they can rarely influence the remote enviro nment (except, for 
example, through radical technological innovation, as in the case of organisations such as 
Intel or Microsoft in the microprocessor, microcomputer and software industries).  CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
In the discussion that follows, we will first identify the remote environmental forces, and 
will then discuss the remote environment in an African and regional context. Lastly, we 
will address the evaluation of an organisation’s strategic response to factors  in the remote 
environment.  
5.3.1  The identification of remote environmental forces  
The most important elements of the remote environment can be identified using the 
traditional PEST framework. They comprise the following factors:13 political (P), economic 
(E), socio -cultural (S)  and technological (T) factors.  The traditional PEST model can be 
extended to include a consideration of legal  (L), environmental  (E) and global  (Gj factors, 
(where (E) refers to the natural environment) to yield the acronym PESTLE/G. You may 
also refer to Chapter 1 (Section 1.6) in which the management environment is explained.  
Analysing the environmental forces and trends at a global, a regional  and a domestic 
level, respectively, is important because it can have an impact on an organisation and its 
internal/micro - and market environments. Below are just a few examples of the 
implications that external environmental forces hold for markets and or ganisations:14 
¦ Political factors. Political factors include aspects such as the government and its 
political policy and economic interventions and policies. The government of a 
country is a major role player in the remote environment of all organisations. An 
example of political forces in South Africa is the change of leadership in the 
ruling party, namely the African National Congress (ALNC).  On 14 February 
2018, the former president Jacob Zuma resigned and was replaced by President 
Cyril Ramaphosa. This h ad an enormous effect on various indicators, for 
example, the value of the country’s currency and business confidence. Business 
confidence can be measured in terms of the Business Confidence Index, which is 
the weighted mean of five sectoral indices, namel y, that of manufacturers, 
building contractors, retailers, wholesalers and new vehicle dealers. Business 
confidence can vary between 0 and 100, where 0 indicates an extreme lack of 
confidence, 50 indicates neutrality and 100 indicates extreme confidence.13 Index 
Points in South Africa increased to 45 Index Points in the first quarter of 2018 
from 34 Index Points in the fourth quarter of 2017 - an increase of 11 points.16 
As a result of these influences, business organisations are also affected. For 
example,  an increase in business confidence may result in organisations investing 
more in new machinery, equipment or buildings in order to increase their 
productive capacity in lieu of an expected increase in the demand for their 
products. Also, consumers will sp end more, and foreign investors will be more 
willing to invest in South African organisations due to higher business 
confidence levels. South Africa has seen many key economic policy changes by 
government, especially for the period 1994 to 2013. The Recons truction and 
Development Programme (RDF), as part of the election platform of the ANC  
109 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
in the 1994 elections, was chosen as the primary socio -economic programme with 
the aim to establish a more equal society through reconstruction and 
development, as well as strengthening democracy for all South Africans. Due to 
various constraints, the government replaces this policy in 1996 by a new macro -
economic policy framework called the Growth, Empl oyment and Redistribution 
(GEAR) strategy, with the aim to stimulate faster economic growth, which was 
required to provide resources to meet social investment needs. In 2005, GEAR 
was replaced by the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Afric a 
(ASGISA) as further development on the first two developmental strategies. 
ASGISA had the following aims: to reduce poverty by 2010, and to halve 
unemployment by 2014 from the 28 per cent in 2004 to 14 per cent by 2012. It 
also recognised that the polici es implemented to address these issues needed to 
be at the forefront of economic policy decision -making. ASGISA was replaced in 
2010 with the New Growth Path (NGP), envisioned to accelerate growth in the 
South African economy, and to do so in ways that rap idly reduces poverty, 
unemployment and inequality. In 2013, government introduced the National 
Development Plan (NDP) 2030 as South Africa’s socio -economic development 
roadmap. This policy was adopted as the blueprint for a future economic and 
socio -econom ic development strategy for the country. The NDP is viewed as a 
policy blueprint for eliminating poverty and reducing inequality in South Africa 
by 2030. In order to address the country’s socio -economic imbalances, the NDP 
identifies the key constraints to  faster growth, among other things, and presents a 
roadmap to a more inclusive economy.17 
¦ Economic factors. These include factors such as the economic  growth  
rate, the inflation rate, interest rates and exchange rates. Economic forces 
influence the demand for products and services, so it is important for strategists 
to monitor and forecast events in the domestic and global economies. Economic 
forces are often interdependent with socio -cultural forces. For instance, an ageing 
population can influence unemplo yment figures and salaries of a younger 
workforce significantly.  
¦ Socio -cultural factors. These include factors such as social values,  culture,  
lifestyles and demographics. Stakeholder groups are products of  society.  
Their values, morals, beliefs and subseq uent behaviours and lifestyles are 
therefore influenced by society at large. Developing social trends may also offer 
organisations various opportunities. For example, health and fitness lifestyle 
trends have created opportunities in the home fitness, nutri tional supplement, low 
carbohydrate food and even bicycle industries. Organisations therefore stand to 
gain if strategists can identify and assess the effects and opportunities presented 
by socio -cultural forces, as well as manage and sustain their relatio ns and 
reputation with stakeholder groups.  
110 CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
¦ Technological factors. These include factors such as research and development, 
new products and processes, and new technologies. The innovation and  
technology fields have grown exponentially in recent years. They are 
continuously driving the development of new products and services, thereby 
creating new industries. They also have the power to transform society and 
revolutionise the way business is co nducted. This is evidenced by the rise of the 
internet, as well as by the communication and computing industries. Innovation 
and technology can spill over from one industry to another, especially if they are 
closely related. The opening case study indicate d that technology is responsible 
for changes in the metered taxi industry. Uber became a major role -player in this 
industry, which reinforces the statement that organisations should also monitor 
developments in innovation and technology in neighbouring, re lated and even 
unrelated industries. Strategists need to evaluate the consequences for their own 
products and services, creating strategies that could take advantage of these 
changes.  
¦ Legal factors. These include factors such as regulations and laws with w hich 
organisations must comply. No organisation is fully exempt from government 
legislation and regulations. However, not all laws and regulations apply equally 
to all organisations. Some (such as smoking laws) pertain to specific industries, 
whereas other  legislation (such as occupational health and safety, labour 
relations, and employment equity in South Africa) cuts across entire industries. 
In our case study, it was indicated that the South African government finds it 
difficult to regulate the new indus try created by Uber. Once regulated, it will 
have an influence on Uber, as well as on the metered taxi industry.  
¦ Environmental factors. These include ecological and environmental forces of 
nature such as weather, climate, climate change and associated fact ors such as 
water shortages. The Western Cape water crises in 2017/2018, as a result of 
prolonged drought, is affecting all industries in South Africa, especially the 
agricultural, hospitality and tourism industries. Even households and individuals 
are aff ected. For example, in 2018 Cape Town households were faced with water 
and sanitation tariff increases of approximately 27 per cent. An increase in these 
tariffs will have a negative effect on consumer behaviour and spending patterns, 
influencing all indus tries. The principles of the UNGC, alluded to earlier in 
Section 5.1, calls on organisations to align their strategies to their environmental 
principles.  
¦ Global factors. Organisations are operating in an increasingly global economy. 
Examples of global tren ds18 which have the potential to significantly affect and 
challenge strategists and leaders in the next 30 years are briefly discussed in 
Table 5.2.

Increasing  
population  The world's population is 
increasing fast from 7.6 billion in 
June 2018 to an expected 9.7 
billion by 2050.19 The South 
African population, as on 4 June 
2018, based on the latest United 
Nations estimates, is 57,348,01520 
and is expected to grow to 
72,754,583 by 2050.21 The need for basic necessities, such as 
food, water and housing, will increase 
as the population increases, while, at 
the same time, water and food sources 
will come increasingly under pressure 
due to diminishing farmland and 
pollution.  
Increasing  
urbanisation  Megacities with 10 million or more 
inhabitants will become 
commonplace. In South  Africa, 
Johannesburg is set to be 
classified as a megacity by 2030, 
with its population exceeding 10 
million people22, while Lagos, 
Cairo and Kinshasa will each have 
to cater for over 20 million 
people.23 Due to the high urbanisation rate, the 
need for va rious products and services 
(such as the need for education, water, 
electricity, housing and medical 
services) to mention only a few, 
increases.  
The spread of 
infectious 
disease  Migration and cross -border flow 
of labour and goods are 
increasing, causing the likelihood 
of epidemics and the spread of 
infectious diseases such as 
hepatitis A, typhoid fever, and 
malaria. An outbreak of listeriosis 
(a serious foodborne disease) has 
been ongoing in South Africa 
since the start of 2017. There were 
978 laboratory -confirmed cases 
and 183 fatalities reported over 
the period 1 January 2017 to 14 
March 2018.  Infectious diseases (such as malaria 
and meningitis) cause a growing 
demand for preventative measures 
(such as insect repellents and 
inoculations) and treatment options.  
Outbreaks of foodborne diseases 
may require strategists to place more 
emphasis on preventative quality 
controls, and to act quickly in the 
case of an outbreak. The food 
processing company and three of its 
retailers export to 15 countries in the 
African region. All of the affected 
countries had to recall the implicated 
products.24 
112 CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
Global trends  Explanation  Examples of implications 
for strategists  
Natural resource 
crises  The global natural resource crises are 
worse than its financial crises. The 2016 
Living Planet Report25 calculates that 
humans are using 30 per cent more 
natural resources than the Earth can 
replenish each year, which is leading to 
deforestation, degraded soils, poll uted 
air and water, and dramatic declines in 
the number of fish and other species. 
The problem is also getting worse as 
populations and consumption keep 
growing faster than technology can find 
new ways of expanding what can be 
produced from the natural env ironment. 
This has led to the prediction that by 
2030, if nothing changes, humankind 
will need two planets to sustain its 
lifestyle.26 In Africa and South Africa 
specifically, the need for and conflict 
over water resources are prominent.27 
Since 2014, the City of Cape Town has 
been experiencing a record drought for 
three consecutive years (the worst in 
more than a century). The drought, 
exacerbated by climate change and 
population growth, has sparked a water 
crisis in Cape Town. In March 2018, 
municipal lea ders warned that residents 
are increasingly likely to face a 'Day 
Zero' scenario. Day zero is defined as 
the day when the supplying dams are 
depleted, and residents are expected to 
live on less than 25 litres per day. If the 
city is unable to deal with the  crisis, then 
four million people may have to stand in 
line surrounded by armed guards to 
collect rations for drinking water.28 Organisations will 
increasingly be required to 
operate in ways that are 
environmentally sustainable 
by reducing their carbon 
footprint, reducing waste 
and reducing their water 
usage.  
113 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Global trends  Explanation  Examples of implications 
for strategists  
Environmental  
degradation  Biodiversity is often used as an indicator of 
the state of the natural environment since it 
refers to the diversity of micro -organisms, 
plants and animal species, as well as to the 
ecosystems within which they interact and 
live. The 2016 Living Planet Report indicates 
the Living Planet In dex (LPI), which 
measures biodiversity by gathering 
population data of various vertebrate 
species and calculating an average change 
in abundance over time. The LPI can 
therefore be regarded as an important 
indicator of the planet's ecological 
conditions. F rom 1970 to 2012, the LPI 
shows a 58 per cent overall decline in 
vertebrate species (mammals, birds, fishes, 
amphibians and reptiles). The most 
common threat to declining populations is 
the loss and degradation of habitat. This 
refers to the modification o f the 
environment where species lives, by either 
complete removal, fragmentation or 
reduction in quality of key habitat 
characteristics. Common causes are 
unsustainable agriculture, logging, 
transportation, residential or commercial 
development, energy pro duction and 
mining. For freshwater habitats, 
fragmentation of rivers and streams and 
abstraction of water are common threats. 
Species over exploitation, pollution, invasive 
species, disease and climate change are 
further threats and contribute to 
environme ntal degradation.29 The decline in 
species populations is inextricably linked to 
the state of the ecosystems that sustain 
them. Destruction of these ecosystems 
represents a risk, not just to plants and 
animals, but to humans as well - ecosystems 
provide us  with food, fresh water, clean air, 
energy, medicine and recreation. Fluman 
life depends upon healthy and diverse 
natural systems for the regulation and 
purification of water and air, climate 
conditions, pollination and seed dispersal, 
and control of pests  and diseases.  Organisations will 
increasingly have to 
understand the impact that 
its current and future 
operations will have on 
biodiversity and the 
ecological systems that 
they operate in. This is 
already becoming part of 
the legal environment.  
For examp le, in South 
Africa Environmental 
Management Inspectors 
(also known as the 'Green 
Scorpions') specifically 
police for transgressions of 
environmental laws and 
regulations.

Economic  
integration  Economic integration refers to an 
agreement between countries in a 
geographic region to reduce and 
ultimately remove, tariff and non -
tariff barriers to the free flow of 
products or services and factors of 
production among each other.30 
Economic integration is a 
phenomenon of the second half 
of the 20th century that has been 
experienced on a varying scale 
and intensity throughout the 
world. Countries from all 
continents seem eager to join 
economic alliances that range 
from customs unions to areas of 
full economic integration, such as 
the European Union. Strong and 
weak economies participate in 
such groups, aiming at stability 
and growth.  Inevitably, participating in these 
alliances con veys important changes 
in the domestic business 
environments of organisations.  
For example, the competition in the 
market environment of 
organisations may change 
completely as a result of economic 
integration. Changes in the quantity 
and quality of demand may also 
appear, requiring strategists to 
reconsider and change 
organisational strategies based on 
these changes. South African 
President Cyril Ramaphosa on 20 
March 2018 punted the idea of a 
single currency for African countries 
in a bid to attract infras tructure 
investment and enable intra -African 
trade, a decision that will have an 
influence on all participating 
countries and organisations within 
these countries.  
Advances in 
technology and 
information 
technology  Advances in technology create 
new processes, systems, material, 
equipment and components.  
New technology enables 
organisations to develop new and 
innovative products and/or 
services. Advanced information 
systems can disseminate essential, 
timely and accurate information 
faster and more eff iciently. New 
processes can increase the 
productivity of organisations. New 
technology and information 
technology results in increased 
competition and forces 
organisations to use the latest 
technology to sustain their 
competitive advantage.  Organisations n eed to be aware of 
technological changes and how they 
affect their businesses. While 
organisations can use technology to 
improve their own efficiency, they 
can also be the victims of 
technology. There is the obvious 
threat of hacking, which means that 
orga nisations have to pay very close 
attention to cybersecurity.  
On a more fundamental level, 
technology can enable new breeds 
of competitors and change the 
business landscape, as we saw in 
the Uber case study earlier in this 
chapter.  \j

Practising Strategy  
A southern African context  
There are a number of strategy books, international and local, available in the South African market. Why another one? What 
makes this book different?  
This publication focuses on strategy implementation and not just on the thinking and analytical aspects of strategic 
management.  
It explores the idea that strategy is often emergent, messy and experimental, unlike other strategic management 
books, which unrealistically portray it as a neat, analytical and rational process.  
It unpacks the recent concept that other strategists, not only just senior management, influence strategic direction.  
It recognises strategy as something people do rather than something an organisation possesses. Si nce people are 
building blocks of strategy, it is a cognitive and political activity.  
It uses primary research conducted among southern African top and middle managers and draws on these managerial 
perspectives to enrich the text with first -hand accounts o f strategy experience.  
The second edition of the book features a number of new chapters, focusing on strategy implementation and change 
management, resource allocation and responsible leadership. It also includes a more detailed coverage of managing 
strategic risk.

INDEX  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .........  Preface  
A question that I was asked often when writing and compiling this book (and that, in all 
honesty, I had asked myself more than once) was: why another strategy book? There were, 
after all, quite a number of books, international and local, already available on the South 
African market. It became clear that we had to position this book definitively to make a 
unique contribution to the extant body of knowledge.  
So how, then, is this book different? We believe that there are five key aspects:  
¦ A cursory review of strategic management books shows that the focus is very strongly 
on the process of strategy formulation, i.e. the thinking and analytical aspects of 
strategic  management, as opposed to the 'doing' part of strategy, which is often 
dealt with in one or two chapters towards the end. Given that it is the greatest 
challenge to managers in the 21st century and the greatest reason for strategy 
failure, we decided to f ocus on strategy implementation instead.  
¦ Most strategic management books portray strategic management as a neat, analytical 
and rational process that flows from top to bottom in the organisation. Rather than 
promoting the unrealistic idea of strategy as a purely rational and deliberate 
outcome, we acknowledge and explore the idea that strategy is often emergent, 
messy and experimental, and above all a human activity.  
¦ Top management has long been regarded as the custodians of strategy. The idea that 
there ar e other strategists (human and non -human actors) such as middle managers 
and consultants that influence the strategic direction of the organisation and 
distribution of resources emerged only relatively recently, and we include this factor.  
¦ We focus on stra tegy as something that people ‘do’ rather than something that an 
organisation ‘possesses’. Since people are the building blocks of strategy, we 
recognise that strategy is both a cognitive and political activity.  
¦ Most South African textbooks rely on seconda ry sources. While we use recent 
secondary sources from the extant body of knowledge, we conducted primary 
research among southern African top and middle managers and drew on these 
managerial perspectives to enrich our material with firsthand accounts of th e strategy 
experience.  
We trust that you will find value in the contemporary and different perspectives we present 
in this book.

Why do business organisations exist? Take a few moments to ponder 
this question. Business organisations exist for various reasons. 
Entrepreneurs generate new business ideas, determine the feasibility 
and viability of these ideas and start new business ventures, in which 
resources are transformed into need -satisfying products and services, 
which are then sold to customers. The entrepreneur hopefully realises a 
profit, of which a part thereof is reinvested i n the business organisation 
in order to grow and develop the business, ensure its long -term 
survival, create jobs, contribute to the wealth and wellbeing of society 
and remunerate the owners for the investment made in the 
organisation. As the business grow s, the role of the entrepreneur 
changes from being the inventor of new ideas, to the manager of the 
business organisation. The bigger the organisation becomes, the more 
complicated the management process becomes, which bring us to the 
next fundamental ques tion - what is the best way to manage an 
organisation?  
When we study the evolution of management theory, this is the 
one recurring theme that management theorists attempt to answer. Do 
a quick Google search for the best way to manage an organisation. You 
will find thousands of views on this topic - ranging from ‘tips to 
manage a small business' to ‘how to manage a big corporate 
effectively and efficiently'. The reason for the numerous views on this 
topic is to enable us to see the proposed 'best' way to man age a 
business organisation in the context of the social, political, economic, 
technological, international, and ecological forces that affect 
organisations and society at a specific time. As these forces change 
(and they change constantly and at an accele rating pace), business 
managers need to change and adapt to changing circumstances in the 
management environment. Changing circumstances lead to great 
uncertainties for businesses, particularly in respect of their 
sustainability and management.  
The opening  case provides us with an example of a highly 
successful organisation that did extremely well on ground level - there 
were 88 Health and Racquet Clubs in South Africa and 22 abroad, 
realising a turnover in excess of R1 billion in December 1999,  
 
2 with after -tax profits of R100 million per annum. The company 
employed thousands of people and had a membership in excess of one 
million. In spite of its good financial performance, the company failed. 
Why? Firstly, the reason for the company's failure can be ascribed to a 
lack of strategic management. The company's board, which is mainly 
responsible for strategic management and leadership, became 
dysfunctional, resulting in a company that lacked strategic direction, a 
coherent strategic plan, and an effective and efficient management 
team to implement the strategic plans, and well - formulated action 
plans. Lastly, poor and in effective communication, with little concern 
for corporate governance, led to the failure of the company.  
The purpose of this book is to provide the reader with the 
necessary background and information, to be able to practise strategy 
successfully in the c ontemporary business environment. Essentially this 
means to:  
develop a long -term and coherent strategic plan within the 
opportunities and constraints of the business environment, 
that leads to the development of strategic actions that need 
to be implemente d and controlled, that will put the 
organisation in a position of advantage and enable it to 
survive over the long term and realise its long -term vision, 
goals and plans.  
Before we can focus on practising strategy, we first need to address the 
relationship  between general management and strategic management. 
This chapter will commence with an explanation of managers, 
management and the management process, the various levels and 
areas of management, followed by an explanation of the hierarchy of 
organisation al plans. Thereafter, we will focus on the composition of 
the management environment, stakeholder and stakeholder 
relationship management. Finally, competitive advantage, sustainable 
competitive advantage and transient competitive advantage will be 
address ed. 
3 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Case study  
LeisureNet - Death of a business  
For a few weeks in September and October 2000, Peter Flack was the interim chief executive 
officer of the ill -fated South African company LeisureNet. He had been called in as a 
turnaround specialist. He found that the company had deteriorated so far and so fast that all 
that could be done for it was to close it.  
LeisureNet was a large business, but the lessons Flack draws from the LeisureNet  
failure need to be learned by every manager. Flack's account of one of South Africa's most 
spectacular corporate failures is briefly provided below.  
Every organisation, whether it be a club, church, company or country, requires four 
basic ingredients for it to be successful. These are leadership, a strategic plan, a management 
team capable of implementing the strategy, and an action plan which breaks the strategic 
plan down into measurable bits. A business is measured against these factors.  
LeisureNet, a s uccessful and profitable company, invited one of the directors of 
Coronation FRM to sit on their board. A brief look at the results for the year to December 
1999 showed a group with a turnover in excess of R1 billion and which made in excess of 
R100 millio n after tax per annum. As a rough rule of thumb, companies that produce after -
tax profits equal to 10 per cent of gross revenue are considered healthy businesses.  
The company operated 85 Health and Racquet (HEtR) Clubs in South Africa and 
employed 4,500 pe ople who provided an excellent service to nearly one million club 
members. In addition, the company expanded offshore and had built 22 HEtR Clubs in 
Australia, Britain, Germany and Spain, with a number being in the process of construction. On 
the surface, LeisureNet was a company with strong leadership, a clear strategy and an 
obviously competent management team.  
At the first board meeting that Flack attended, it was clear that the board had 
become dysfunctional and there was conflict between the executive and non -executive 
directors. The previous joint chief executive officer of LeisureNet had been transferred to 
Healthland International Limited (again as joint chief executive officer). Healthland 
International Limited was a company that operated health and  fitness clubs in Australia. The 
previous leaders had sold almost all their interests in LeisureNet and had been awarded a 
substantial and meaningful stake, free of charge, in Healthland International Limited. 
LeisureNet's young managing director of the So uth African operations had been approached 
to take the job as CEO of LeisureNet but had not accepted the position, and the terms of his 
appointment had not been finalised. It was clear that there was a problem with leadership.  
Part of the conflict at board  level was due to the fact the LeisureNet had been used to 
fund, staff and train employees of Healthland. The HEtR Club business had been pillaged to 
establish Healthland's operations and all available cash had been invested in Healthland and 
little, if an y, in the HEtR Club business. Some R370 million of this available cash had come 
from selling shares. The result was a lack of maintenance and refurbishment at HEtR Clubs.  
4 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES  AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
On closer examination, there was no strategic plan. A strategy, which is not reduced to 
writing, is a hope, wish or prayer, but not a plan. A strategic plan requires that its participants 
follow a procedure, which identifies and a nalyses the various internal and external issues that 
affect the business.  
The lack of a coherent strategic plan in LeisureNet can be seen from the fact that the 
company had over the previous five years, when it was still in business, also established a 
food business, a golfing business, an education business, a casino bid, a gymnasium 
equipment supplier, a restaurant and the six -member Imax theatre chain. Despite the fact 
that LeisureNet owned only half the equity of the Imax group, the company guaranteed 100 
per cent of the leases of the purpose -built facilities housing the theatres and which extended 
over 13 -20 years.  
Structure follows strategy and the lack of strategy manifested itself in the 
composition of the board of directors of LeisureNet. Instead of the various disciplines 
inherent in a company being represented on the board of directors, for example, finance, 
information systems, human resources and the line operations, the board consisted of two 
former joint chief executive officers, the managing  director of the local operations and a host 
of non -executive directors.  
Although the management information system was homegrown and, in many 
instances, required a duplication of effort, the accounting system, sales system, marketing 
and human resources p rocedures were well thought out. In moving offshore with Healthland 
International Limited, the business there had adopted the best of the local operating 
systems, acquired a standard management information system and had recruited the most 
senior of the lo cal managers. The glaring omission, however, related to the position of chief 
financial officer and the treasury and cash management functions for this massively cash -
hungry growth business in a state of rapid development. Ultimately, this gap in the 
manag ement structure caused the downfall of Healthland as there was no action plan of any 
kind.  
The group, with the notable exception of the HStR Club business, did not meet, let 
alone pass, any of the standards required by the four components for any successfu l 
business, namely, leadership, strategic planning, management and action planning. There 
were two other glaring omissions, namely, a lack of corporate communications and 
corporate governance.  
The group could have been saved had it been possible to raise s ufficient money to 
complete the building of the Healthland clubs under construction, or if the sale of these 
offshore clubs could have been concluded in a way that would have released LeisureNet 
from its obligations to the Healthland group. In the end, bot h attempts failed. Both of these 
failures can be traced back to fundamental flaws in the issues of leadership, strategy, 
corporate communications and corporate governance.

5 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
LO 1:  Explain  the concepts  ‘manager1 and 'management'.  
1.1 Managers and management  
Although the term ‘manager’ has many meanings, for the purpose of this chapter, we will 
define a manager  as a person who is responsible for running a part of or an entire 
organisation. The term ‘management’ refers to the interlocking functions that managers 
perform. For the purposes of this book, management is defined as:  
the process of working with and thro ugh others to achieve organisational  
objectives in a changing environment.  
Managers experience more pressure today than at any other time in history. Changes in the 
world that are impacting on managers include the growing globalisation of economies, 
technological innovations, trends towards democratisation, increasing social imbalances 
and climate change, to mention only a few. In South Africa, the credit rating agency S£tP 
Global downgraded the country’s credit rating in November 2017 to full junk st atus, while 
its counterpart Moody’s placed the country on review for a downgrade. The downgrading 
followed a similar announcement by third major rating agency Fitch, affirming South 
Africa’s rating at sub -investment or so -called ‘junk status’. The reason f or the downgrade 
by this agency was the weak economic growth in the country that led to the deterioration of 
public finances beyond previous expectations. It also flagged the role that the political 
turmoil of the country played in hamstringing policy.1 Having a credit rating at sub -
investment level means that South Africa is not regarded as a country with good investment 
opportunities and investors will be hesitant to invest money in the country’s private and 
public sectors - resulting in a slower economic  growth rate, a lower gross national product, 
and a threat to business managers.  
Business managers need to cope with diverse and far -reaching challenges such as 
these constantly. They have to keep pace with ever -advancing technology and find ways to 
incorp orate the internet and e -business into their strategies and business models. They must 
strive to remain competitive in the face of increasingly tough global competition, uncertain 
environments, cutbacks in personnel and resources, and massive economic, pol itical and 
social shifts. The diversity of the workforce creates other dynamics: How can managers 
maintain a strong corporate culture while supporting diversity, balancing work and family 
concerns, and coping with the conflicting demands of all employees f or a fair chance at 
power and responsibility? The field of management is undergoing a revolution that requires 
managers to do more with less, to see change rather than stability as the nature of things, 
and to create a vision and cultural values that enabl e people to create a truly collaborative 
and enabling workplace.  
Successful organisations don’t just happen; they are managed to be that way. To be 
successful under such circumstances, every organisation needs skilled managers. In our 
opening case, we saw a once successful organisation that closed due to poor management 
and more specifically, poor strategic management.  
6 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
The question that we can ask ourselves now is what should managers do to achieve 
organisational objectives as effectively and efficiently as possible within a changing 
environment? The objective of this chapter is to provide the reader with a contemporary 
view of general management pr inciples and the application thereof in modern organisations, 
and to demonstrate the relationship between these general management principles and 
strategic management. This will lay the foundation for the contemporary strategic 
management principles that w ill be discussed in the remainder of the book. Everything 
addressed in subsequent chapters of this book relates to practising strategy in contemporary 
organisations and the job of the modern strategist.  
LO 2:  Explain  the management  process,  indicating  the four characteristics  thereof.  
1.2 The management process  
For the purposes of this book, management is defined as:  
the process of working with and through others to achieve organisational objectives 
in a changing environment.  
Although this may seem to be a very  simplistic definition, we can identify four major 
characteristics, namely:  
(1) management is a process  
(2) management entails working with and through others  
(3) management aims to contribute to the realisation of organisational goals and 
objectives, and in doing so,  management needs to balance effectiveness and 
efficiency and makes the most of limited and scarce resources  
(4) management needs to cope with a changing environment.  
Each of these components will be discussed in more detail below.  
1.2.1  Management is a process  
In general, a process can be described as a structured, interrelated set of activities that, 
when executed, produce a specific output. The management function in an organisation can 
also be viewed as a process.  
Managers need certain inputs (or resources) to d eliver certain outputs (or 
performance). Managers need people (human resources); capital (financial resources), 
physical resources, raw materials, components, information, and entrepreneurial and 
management skills to produce products and/or services, creat e jobs, make a profit, achieve 
organisational goals and add value, and contribute to the wealth of society. The 
transformation of inputs to outputs requires management to perform certain activities or 
functions. All managers, regardless of the type of orga nisation, the  
7 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
level at which they are involved, their designated role(s) or specific skills, engage in some 
manner in four fundamental, interrelated activities in order to achieve some or other 
goal(s), also called the management functions. These functions are planning, organising, 
leading, and controlling.  
¦ Planning is the management function that determines the organisation’s vision, 
mission, strategic direction and goals. It involves iden tifying ways of realising the 
goals, adding value to the organisation and its stakeholders and finding the resources 
needed for the task within a complex environment. Plans are mostly made by top 
management and its duration varies from one to five or even ten years. These are 
called ‘strategic plans’. Tactical plans are made by functional managers (such as 
financial, human resources, research and development, marketing and operations 
managers) to support the organisation’s long -term plans. Operational plans  are made 
by lower management (often called ‘first - line’ or ‘supervisory’ management) to plan 
for short periods ahead. Planning has a top -down nature in organisations, originating 
from top management and cascading down to lower levels of management and ev en at 
the level of the individual worker in an organisation.  
¦ Organising is the second step in the management process. Once the goals and plans 
have been determined, management has to allocate the organisation’s resources to 
relevant departments or individu als. Tasks, roles and responsibilities must be defined 
and policies and procedures established to achieve the goals. Thus, organising 
involves developing a framework or organisational structure to indicate how people 
and other resources should be deployed to achieve the goals. The success of an 
organisation lies in directing the different resources towards the achievement of a 
common set of goals. The better the resources are co -ordinated and organised, the 
more successful the organisation will be. Because organisations have different goals 
and resources, it stands to reason that each one should have an organisational structure 
that will accommodate its needs. Management must match the organisation’s structure 
to its strategies. This process is called ‘organ isational design’.  
¦ Managers are responsible for getting things done through other people - they 
collaborate with their superiors, peers and subordinates, with both individuals and 
groups, to attain the goals of the organisation. Leading the organisation en tails using 
influence and power to motivate employees to achieve goals. Leading from the top 
means communicating strategic goals and motivating departments, sections and 
individuals to perform as well as they can.  
¦ Controlling means that managers should con stantly make sure that the organisation is 
on the right course to attain its goals. Control also enables management to identify and 
rectify any deviations from the plans, and to consider factors which might oblige them 
to revise their goals and plans.  
It is important to realise that the functions of management do not occur in a tidy, step -by-
step order. At any given time, a manager is likely to be engaged in several management 
functions simultaneously.  
8 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN  GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
While performing the planning, organising, leading and controlling functions, managers are 
constantly faced with opportunities and threats that need to be addressed and decisions that 
need to be made.  When planning, a manager needs to make decisions about goals and when, 
where and how they should be realised. When controlling, the manager may find out that 
the goals have not been realised. Thus, a problem exists that needs to be solved and the 
manager needs to decide on the most appropriate course of action. When organising, 
managers must make decisions that involve the creation of an organisational structure and 
the deployment of resources that will enable the organisation to attain its goals. When 
leading, the manager must decide how to influence and direct the behaviour of followers so 
that they willingly pursue the goals of the organisation. Decision -making is therefore a 
central aspect of all four managerial functions. In the opening case, managers (and the 
senior manager especially) at LeisureNet made poor decisions, resulting in the failure of 
the organisation.  
The term ‘resources’ is extremely comprehensive. The following basic resources can 
be found in all organisations, namely, people (human res ources), money (capital or 
financial resources), raw materials (physical resources), knowledge (information 
resources), technology, information and components. Management utilises these resources 
to achieve the goals of the organisation as efficiently and effectively as possible. Resources 
are scarce and management’s biggest challenge is to utilise its resources as productively as 
possible. Managers need to make choices in terms of what programmes, projects and 
activities to pursue with the limited resource s at their disposal. Managers also have the task 
of bringing resources together, deciding which resources are necessary for a specific 
situation or specific circumstances, and in what quantities, to achieve the organisation’s 
goals. The success with which an organisation achieves its goals and satisfies the ever -
increasing needs of society depends on the competence of its managers in utilising its 
scarce resources. If managers utilise resources well, the organisation will be successful. If 
a country’s organ isations are competitive and successful, the country as a whole will 
prosper because successful organisations satisfy needs, not only by producing products and 
services, but also by providing jobs and contributing to the wealth of society. The inputs or 
resources of an organisation are transformed to realise certain outputs, of which goal 
achievement, products, services, profit, job creation, efficiency and effectiveness are the 
most important outputs.  
In the case study, we saw the detrimental effect of the  poor management of 
LeisureNet’s financial resources - LeisureNet was used to fund, staff and train employees 
of Healthland. The Health and Racket Club business was pillaged to establish Healthland’s 
operations and all available cash was invested in Health land, with very little in the Health 
and Racket Club business. This resulted in a lack of maintenance and refurbishment at 
Health and Racket Clubs.  
1.2.2  Management entails working with and through others  
Managers get things done by working with and through othe r people. Management is, above 
all else, a social process. Many collective purposes bring individuals together  
9 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
- building houses and cars, publishing books, offering tertiary education, providing 
personal financial services, and so on. The activities that are needed to build a house or a 
car, publish a book, offer tertiary education programmes and to provide advice on personal 
finances, cannot happen on their own. In all cases, managers a re needed to get things done 
by working with and through other people and other organisations.  
The ability to work with and through others is therefore an important skill that 
managers should have in order to be successful. Problems with interpersonal rela tionships 
and failure to build and lead a team are often the reasons why managers fail, as we have 
already seen in the case study of this chapter.  
1.2.3  Management aims to achieve organisational goals and 
objectives, balance effectiveness and efficiency, and 
make the most of limited resources  
An objective can be described as a target to be strived for. A university student, for 
example, can set an objective for him or herself, to graduate with a specific degree by a 
given date. All actions taken or activities performed by the student, will be with the view to 
achieve this target. As with individuals, organisations formulate organisational objectives. 
Organisations will also be more successful when their activities are guided by challenging, 
yet realistic and ac hievable objectives. Organisational goals and objectives serve later as 
measuring sticks for performance. Without goals and objectives, the management process 
would be aimless and wasteful. In the case study, we determined that the absence of 
organisationa l goals and objectives, contributed to the failure of the company.  
It is important to distinguish between the concepts of effectiveness and efficiency. 
Effectiveness is achieved when the organisation formulates and pursues appropriate (or 
stated) goals. Ef fectiveness, in essence, means ‘doing the right things’ in order to achieve 
the objectives of the organisation.  
Given the reality of limited resources, effectiveness alone is not enough. An 
organisation also needs to be efficient. Efficiency enters the pic ture when the resources 
required to achieve an objective are weighed against what was accomplished. The 
organisation will be more efficient if the ratio between benefits (outputs or performance) 
and costs (inputs or resources) is more favourable. Efficienc y essentially means ‘doing 
things right’. Efficiency is achieved by using the fewest inputs (such as the number of 
people employed or the amount of capital utilised during the financial year) to generate a 
maximum amount of output (such as a number of prod ucts produced or the profit realised 
within a financial year).  
Managers are responsible for balancing effectiveness and efficiency. Too much 
emphasis on either effectiveness or efficiency leads to mismanagement. On the one hand, 
managers must be effective by getting the job done. On the other hand, managers need to be 
efficient by reducing costs and not wasting resources.  CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
Too much emphasis on effecti veness will mean that the job gets done, but limited resources 
are wasted. Too much emphasis on efficiency will mean that the job gets done, but 
available resources are underutilised. Thus, the answer lies in a balanced emphasis on 
effectiveness and effici ency - the job gets done and limited resources are not wasted.  
In a business context, organisations have access to limited and scarce resources and 
managers need to make the most of these resources. In the bigger picture, we live in a 
world of scarcity and  limited resources. Although experts and non -experts alike may 
quibble over exactly how long it will take to exhaust our non -renewable resources or come 
up with exotic new technological alternatives, one fact remains: our planet is becoming 
increasingly cr owded and sustainability and sustainable development should be among the 
main concerns for managers. Organisational sustainability means to maintain, to keep 
being, to preserve and to support, with structures to hold on to. For an organisation to be 
sustai nable, it must sustain its resources and the uses thereof. It also means that 
organisations should balance their social, environmental (ecological) and financial aspects 
- the so -called ‘triple -bottom line’ which will be further explained in Section 1.7 of  this 
chapter. In productive organisations, managers are the custodians of limited and scarce 
resources and it is their job to see that the basic factors of production are used efficiently 
and effectively.  
1.2.4. Management needs to cope with a changing 
environment  
Successful managers are the ones who anticipate and adjust to changing circumstances 
rather than those who are passively swept along or caught unprepared. In Section 1.5, we 
will elaborate on the management environment.  
We can conclude this sec tion with Business Week's  amusing but challenging profile 
of tomorrow’s managers: ‘The next generation of corporate leaders will need the charm of a 
debutante, the flexibility of a gymnast, and the quickness of a panther. A few foreign 
languages and a keen  understanding' of technology won’t hurt either’.2 
LO 3:  Differentiate  between  the various  levels  of management.  
1.3 Levels of management  
The management process and functions of management, explained in the previous section, 
merely provide us with a starting point for understanding what management and strategic 
management, specifically, entails. To add to the complexity of the process, management 
takes place at different levels and in different areas within organisations. While managers 
at each level and in ea ch area must generally possess planning, organising, leading and 
controlling skills, certain job -specific activities and skills are more important at one level 
than at another.  
11 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Managers function at various levels in the organisational hierarchy. A small organisation 
may have only one layer of management, whereas a medium - to large sized organisation may 
have several layers. In general, relatively large organisations (especially government al 
organisations) have three levels of management: top -level managers, middle managers and 
lower -level managers.  
¦ Top management, also referred to as senior management, represents the relatively 
small group of managers who control the organisation as a whol e and with whom the 
final authority and responsibility for executing the management process rest. Top 
management is responsible for strategic planning that includes determining the vision, 
mission, strategic direction, overall goals, strategies and plans o f the organisation. 
Top management is concerned mainly with strategic planning that has the following 
characteristics: first, strategic planning focuses on the entire organisation; second, it 
aims to reconcile the organisation’s strengths and weaknesses in  its internal 
environment, with the threats and opportunities in the external environment; third, 
strategic planning focuses on creating and maintaining a competitive advantage for the 
organisation; fourth, it considers synergy and aims to co -ordinate the efforts of 
departments and individuals to contribute to the attainment of competitive advantage 
and the long -term goals of the organisation; lastly, strategic plans filter down in the 
organisation to form the basis of tactical and operational plans.  
Top managers are also responsible for designing the organisation’s broad 
organisational structure, leading the organisation (through the top executive) and 
controlling it. Top management also influences the corporate culture, organisational 
change, the allocat ion of resources on corporate level and determines the culture of 
the organisation in terms of organisational learning. Strategic managers continuously 
monitor the external and internal environment of the organisation to identify possible 
opportunities, th reats, strengths and weaknesses. The annual reports of organisations 
usually depict their top management structure. This level of management generally 
comprises the board of directors, partners, the managing director, chief executive 
officers, management c ommittees and other governing bodies. In this book, the focus 
will be on the top management of organisations and their responsibilities in terms of 
strategic management. Traditionally, top managers were considered the only people 
responsible for strategic management. The contemporary view of management 
suggests that top managers alone are not the only strategists and that any individual or 
group in an organisation that controls key actions can be regarded as a role -player in 
strategic management.  
¦ Middle man agement, also referred to as functional management, is responsible for 
specific departments or functions of the organisation. Middle management primarily 
deals with tactical planning and implementing the policies, plans and strategies 
formulated by top man agement. It normally includes the functional heads, such as the 
marketing manager, the financial manager, the purchasing manager and the human 
resources manager. Middle management is concerned with the near future and is 
therefore responsible for medium -term and short term planning, organising functional 
areas, leading by means of the departmental  
12 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
heads, and controlling the management activities o f the middle managers’ own 
departments. Middle managers also continually monitor environmental influences that 
may affect their own departments. The trend in recent years of corporate restructuring, 
delayering, downsizing and decentralisation of decision -making has been responsible 
for large numbers of middle managers being made redundant. Electronic technology 
has reduced the need for middle management in some organisations. In the area of 
information management, in particular, computers have replaced the information -
gathering tasks of middle managers. Middle managers are, however, still essential in 
linking the upper and lower levels of the organisation and in implementing the 
strategies developed at the executive level.  
¦ Lower -level management (also called  supervisory or first -line management) is 
responsible for even smaller segments of the organisation, namely, the different 
subsections. The managerial functions of first -line managers are centred around the 
daily activities of their departments or sections , on short -term planning, and on 
implementing the plans of middle management. Their primaiy concern is to apply 
policies, procedures and rules in order to achieve a high level of productivity, to 
provide technical assistance, to motivate subordinates and t o accomplish day -to-day 
goals. Typically, they spend a large portion of their time supervising the work of 
subordinates. Because of this, first -line management is a vital force in the 
organisation. These managers hold the power to increase or decrease the productivity 
and output of most organisations. They also maintain the crucial interface between 
management and the major body of employees in the organisation. This level of 
management usually comprises titles such as office manager, shift supervisor, 
adve rtising manager, debtors’ clerk or section manager.  
LO 4:  Explain  the various areas of management.  
1.4 Areas of management  
We can distinguish between various functional areas of management in organisations, 
namely, finance, operations, human resources, procure ment, research and development, 
public relations and marketing.  
¦ The financial function is  responsible for  obtaining  the necessary finances for  
an organisation at the lowest cost, investing these finances in assets that would earn 
greater returns than the cost of capital, as well as managing the profitability, liquidity 
and solvency of the organisation.  
¦ The operations function  includes that  group of  activities concerned with  
the actual provision of  goods and services to  the organisation’s clients.  
Operations management  systematically  designs,  directs and controls the  
process that transforms inputs into products and services for both internal and external 
customers.  
13 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
¦ The human resour ces function involves the appointment, development and maintenance 
of the human resources of the organisation. To enable the organisation to operate at 
optimum levels, the human resources manager must appoint the right people and 
provide them with the righ t training in order to make the best use of them.  
¦ The procurement function is concerned with buying the materials and resources needed 
to create products and services. The manager responsible for procurement needs to 
balance a number of constraints. He/she  needs to ensure that the right product is 
available, at the right time, in the right quantity and of the right quality, at the best 
possible price.  
¦ The research and development function is responsible for developing new products and 
services and improving  old products and services. This function is critical in 
organisations that operate in fast -changing environments, such as information 
technology, communications, and so on.  
¦ The public relations function of an organisation is responsible for creating a 
favourable, objective image of the organisation and for establishing good relationships 
with those directly or indirectly concerned with the business and its products or 
services.  
¦ The marketing function is responsible for getting the final customer and client  to buy 
the organisation’s products or services. The marketing function is concerned with new 
product development, promotion and distribution.  
While all the functions listed above are specialised areas of management, which require 
more specific and special ist skills, managers in each area still plan, organise, lead and 
control. A financial manager, for example, is responsible for determining the financial 
goals of the organisation, thus performing the planning function of management. The 
financial manager a lso needs to organise financial activities by allocating financial tasks to 
people so that financial goals can be achieved. The financial manager takes the lead in 
financial activities, motivating and directing members of staff in the financial section to 
perform their duties in pursuit of the financial targets. Lastly, financial managers need to 
ensure that financial goals are accomplished through the implementation of financial 
control mechanisms.  
LO 5:  Explain  the hierarchy  of organisational  plans  and depict it diagrammatically.  
1.5 The hierarchy of organisational plans  
From the discussions so far, we have learned that management is a process and that 
managers engage in some manner in four fundamental, interrelated activities (planning, 
organising, leading and control) in order to realise the goals of an organisation and to add 
value to the organisation and society. These activities are executed on various hierarchical 
levels of an organisation, and the focus of strategic management and of this book, is on t he 
highest of these levels, namely, top or senior management. The  
14 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
planning stage of the management process is a top -down approach, which entails  top 
managers formulating a strategic plan, which is a document that indicates the direction of 
the organisation. A strategic plan consists of the following seven elements: vision; mission; 
analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats ( SWOT analysis); core 
organisational values; goals; objectives and strategies.  
¦ Strategic plans filter down in the organisation and form the basis of tactical plans 
crafted on middle management levels.  
¦ Tactical plans focus on the functional areas of the organisation, are more specific than 
strategic plans and should take synergy into account. So, in other words, it should 
contribute to the attainment of the overall organisational goals. Tactical plans form 
the basis of operational plans, developed by midd le and lower levels of management.  
¦ Operational plans are narrowly focused, with a relatively short time horizon. Three 
basic forms of operational plans exist, namely, single -use, standing, and individual 
plans.  
¦ Single -use plans are used once to meet the ne eds of a particular or unique situation. 
Programmes, projects and budgets are examples of single -use plans. In this context, a 
programme refers to a set of activities designed to accomplish a specific objective 
over a period of time. A programme consists o f various projects, with predetermined 
completion dates and budgets. A budget can be described as a numerical plan for 
allocating resources to specific predetermined activities.  
¦ Standing plans provide guidance because they deal with issues or problems that  occur 
frequently. Policies, procedures and rules are examples of standing plans.  
¦ Operational plans form the basis of individual plans, which are defined as the broader 
organisational plans that are translated into plans for the individual worker. It is al so 
on the individual level that the implementation and execution of strategic plans 
commence, from where they culminate in the realisation of operational goals, and, 
ultimately, in the strategic goals of the organisation. The hierarchy of plans is 
depicted  in Figure 1.1.  
For managers to formulate realistic operational and individual plans, they need clear 
guidance and plans from strategic and tactical managers. Only if the different kinds of 
plans are understood, will lower levels of management and individuals be able to develop 
operational and individual plans.  
The execution of the fundamental managerial activities by all levels and areas of 
management does not happen in isolation - the organisation (as a system) is part of a bigger 
system that we r efer to as the management environment. The composition of the 
management environment is described in the next section.

LO 6:  Explain  the composition  of the management  environment.  
1.6 The composition of the management environment  
It is crucial to realise that organisations and their managements, source inputs from the 
environment, transform them into outputs, which are then returned to the environment. 
These are the main elements of any system: input -? transformation -+ output. The success 
of the organisation as a system is largely determined by the efficiency and effectiveness 
illustrated by its management in performing planning, organising, leading and controlling 
functions. Furthermore, a system’s success depends on successful interactions with its 
environme nt. In this context, the environment includes other sub -environments such as 
suppliers, labour unions, financial institutions, customers, and so on. The organisation is 
dependent on its external environment. Managements must therefore understand the 
struct ure and dynamics of the unique management environment of their organisations and, 
even more importantly, the unique strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats 
pertaining to the environment that impact directly or indirectly on the success of the 
orga nisation.  
16 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
As the first step to a better understanding of the management environment, it is important 
for the manager to take account of its stru cture and dynamics. Without such an 
understanding, no realistic strategising can take place. Structurally, the management 
environment can be divided into the micro -environment, the market environment (industiy) 
and the remote environment.  
1.6.1  The micro - or int ernal environment  
The micro -environment can also be referred to as the internal environment and includes the 
organisation’s functions, policies, strategies, goals, objectives, and available resources, and 
also designates the area over which the manager has  total or full control. Vodacom, a 
leading cellular network, has various features that we can identify from its micro -
environment. For example, it represents a culture characterised by a winning spirit and 
passion for the job, progressive human resources p olicies, commitment to transformation, 
investment in social development programmes, successful staff retention programmes, 
competitive remuneration packages, successful skills development programmes, and 
commitment to ethical conduct and social development . Top or strategic managers play a 
profound role in the establishment of the micro -environment of the organisation. The 
factors in Vodacom’s micro -environment are all under the direct control of its management, 
mainly the strategic managers of the company.  
1.6.2  The external environment  
The external environment comprises two major components, namely the market 
environment and the remote environment. The external environment also designates the 
area outside of the organisation over which the manager has no control.  
1.6.2.1  The market environment  
The market environment lies between the micro -environment and the remote environment 
and forms a buffer between the organisations and the remote environment. Some authors 
refer to it as the operating, competitive, task envir onment or industry. Other authors, in 
turn, refer to it as the ‘meso -environment’ or the intermediate environment. For the purpose 
of this book, we shall refer to it as the ‘market environment’. The market environment 
comprises the following sub -environmen ts: (1) customers (clients), their needs, purchasing 
power, behaviour and bargaining power; (2) suppliers of capital, materials and labour and 
the bargaining power of suppliers; (3) the population from which the organisation recruits 
its labour force and t he unions representing it; and (4) competitors, including new entrants, 
existing competitors, the availability of substitute products or services and complementary 
products or services.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
The customer  
Customers can be defined as all those people or organisations that buy products or services 
from other people and other organisations. On the other hand, the market for the 
organisation’s product and/or service consists of people who have needs to  be satisfied and 
the financial means with which to satisfy their needs. The customer and the market for an 
organisation’s product and/or service, is the main reason why an organisation exists. This is 
true for both private -sector and public -sector entitie s. For business entities in the private 
sector, to have no customers is to have no revenue and no profits; their survival depends on 
the customer. On the other hand, owing to their annual budget allocations from government, 
the supply of public -service ent ities do not depend, for their survival, on their products or 
services they supply to their customers, which is the community. Customers also exhibit 
buyer behaviour, which is influenced by variables in the macro -environment. For example, 
demographic trend s affect the number of customers, economic trends influence the 
purchasing power of consumers, and cultural values can influence the buying behaviour of 
most customers.  
Competitors  
Aside from customers, competitors are the single most important day -to-day force 
associated with an organisation. Competition in the market environment is a situation in 
which different organisations with more or less the same product or service compete for the 
business patronage by the same consumers. Every organisation that tri es to market a service 
and/or product in the market environment is constantly up against existing competition. In 
the case of business organisations, the competition is other businesses currently active in 
the same market sector who are competing for a sha re of the market. New entrants refer to 
potential competitors that have the resources to enter the current market in which 
established organisations operate.  
A thorough competitor analysis, in which strategic managers should play a major 
role, can help an organisation to understand, interpret and predict its competitor’s actions 
and responses. Understanding the actions of competitors is clearly an important factor 
contributing to the organisation’s ability to compete successfully.  
The labour market and labo ur unions  
Although the labour market in economic theory equates to other markets, such as the 
financial market or the market for products and services, it has its own unique 
characteristics. The labour market comprises many different markets, such as those  for 
various skill levels, occupations, age groups, industries, genders and geographical regions. 
These markets are to some extent interchangeable, yet barriers to mobility do exist. Another 
important difference between the labour market and other markets is the temporary nature 
of employment relationships. Once a purchaser buys products for consumption, it becomes 
the property of the buyer. This is not so with the employment relationship. Either the 
employer or employee may decide to terminate the relation ships. This leads to greater 
fluidity and unpredictability in the labour  
18 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
market. Organisation’s ability to attract and retain capable employees from the labour 
market is essential to its success. This ability, on the one hand, is greatly influenced by the 
strategic managers of an organisation. On the other hand, an organisation’s personnel 
recruitment and selection alternatives are often influence d by the nature of both its external 
and its internal environments. An organisation’s access to needed personnel is affected 
primarily by three factors, namely, the organisation’s reputation as an employer, local 
economic conditions and subsequent employme nt rates, as well as the availability of people 
with the required skills. Organisations thus also compete for skilled and competent labour 
with other organisations, where labour unions play an integral role. Again, strategic 
managers play a profound role i n determining the organisation’s reputation as an employer 
and in its ability to attract and retain the necessary skilled human resources.  
Intermediaries  
In addition to consumers, competitors, the labour market and labour unions in the market 
environment, intermediaries also play an important role and affect the organisation directly 
and indirectly. Intermediaries act as middlemen between the manufacturer of products and 
services and the final consumer thereof. Intermediaries include wholesalers, retailers,  
agents and brokers, all of whom play a role in bringing a product or service from the 
manufacturer to the final consumer. Financial intermediaries, such as banks, insurers and 
other financial institutions, play a role in providing an organisation with the  necessary 
capital to start and run a successful business.  
Suppliers  
Organisations need various inputs and depend on suppliers to provide regular supplies of 
these inputs. Most of the inputs used by the organisation form part of a value - creation 
process manifested in the value chain. The value chain can be described as a c hain of 
activities that an organisation, operating in a specific industiy, performs in order to deliver 
a valuable product or service for the market that it serves. Through the use of a value 
chain, value can be created for the role -players and a sustainab le competitive advantage 
created for the organisation. The concentration of suppliers and the availability of 
substitutes are, on the one hand, of extreme importance to the effective functioning and 
survival of the organisation, and, on the other, also sig nificant factors in determining 
supplier bargaining power. The terms competitive advantage  and sustainable competitive 
advantage  will further be clarified in Section 1.8.  
1.6.2.2  The remote environment  
The remote environment refers to the broader environment withi n which the organisation 
must function. The remote environment surrounds the market environment. It includes all 
PESTLE/G (explained in Chapter 5, Section 5.3.1) external influences that do not fall 
directly within the sphere of influence of the organisati on, but which do have a bearing on 
its activities. When analysing the macro -environment, the emphasis falls on the changes 
that the uncontrollable variables at the macro -level  
19 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
cause and the strategic implications these hold for the organisation. For the purpose of 
systematic analysis, a number of sub -environments can be distinguished within the remote 
environment, namely, the political; economic; social, technological; legal; environmenta l; 
and international environments. Each of these sub -environments of the remote environment 
will be discussed below in more detail.  
The political/legislative environment  
The state is a major role -player in the remote environment of an organisation, because  it 
influences the organisation primarily as a regulating force. The state enforces laws, directly 
affecting the way that organisations operate. Tax regulations, for instance, have a direct 
influence on each and every organisation and individual. Value -added taxes (VAT), for 
instance, was 14 per cent in South Africa. In the budget speech delivered on 21 February 
2018, Malusi Gigaba the country’s minister of finance at the time, announced an increase in 
the value -added tax rate of 1 per cent to 15 percent, t he first increase of this tax rate in 25 
years. The country experienced major changes in its political environment in 2018. The 
major leadership changes of the ruling political party, the African National Congress, made 
world news. Former president Jacob Z uma resigned and was replaced with President Cyril 
Ramaphosa, who announced major cabinet changes and declared a country free of 
corruption. These adjustments led to major changes in financial markets, with an increase in 
the value of the country’s currenc y, having a direct impact on organisations, especially 
those involved in multi -national business. With this in mind, strategic managers should be 
aware of changes in this environment that may require them to revisit the organisation’s 
vision, mission state ment, goals and strategies.  
The economic environment  
After technology, the economic environment plays a huge role in the remote environment. 
Organisations are influenced by factors such as business cycles, interest rates, inflation, 
unemployment, trends with regard to the gross national product (GNP) and the economic 
growth rate, monetary and fiscal policy, trends in the balance of payments, the current and 
provisional status of the economy in terms of recession and depression, the influence of 
resources,  and so on. The economy, in turn, is affected by technology, politics, ecology, 
social trends and the international environment. These cross -influences constantly bring 
about fluctuations in the economy, affecting organisations, strategic managers and all other 
levels of management. Strategic management therefore needs to keep abreast of economic 
changes and trends which require them to revisit the organisation’s vision, mission 
statement, goals and strategies.  
The social environment  
The social environment refers to the cultural and demographic aspects of the environment. 
Cultural forces, which underpin society and surround an organisation, are often not as 
visible as other general environmental forces. Culture refers to the unique pattern of shared 
characte ristics, such as values, that distinguish the members  
20 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
of one group of people from another group. A value can be defined as the basic belief about 
a certain condition that has considerable importance and meaning to individuals. People’s 
values are relatively stable over time. A value system comprises multiple beliefs that are 
compatible and supportive of one another. Managers need to appreciate  the significance of 
the values and value systems of all its stakeholders  
- globalisation and global competition is a reality and the number of organisations that 
accept contracts and other assignments in other countries, is rapidly increasing. Realising 
the importance of cultural diversity can help strategic and other managers understand their 
international partners and, ultimately, to be more effective and efficient managers. The 
social environment also includes various demographic factors, such as, the age  distribution 
population growth rate, emphasis on safety, career attitudes, and so on.  
The technological environment  
The technological environment is primarily responsible for changes in the remote 
environment. Technology can be defined as the knowledge, t ools, actions and techniques 
that are used to transform ideas, information, raw materials and components into finished 
products and services. Furthermore, technology encapsulates the physical elements of 
human invention and innovation. Many new technologie s are radical enough to force 
organisations, especially in high -tech industries, to reconsider their vision, purpose and 
methods of operation or face extinction. An analysis of the technological environment is 
crucial for strategic managers.  
The most basic  effect of technology and technological innovation is probably higher 
productivity. The ability of an organisation to produce more and better products poses a 
threat to competitors, compelling them to reassess their strategic plans, organisational 
structur es, production methods, markets and other functional strategies. Effective 
management of technology and innovation is an extremely important source of competitive 
advantage for an organisation.  
The environmental environment  
The environmental environment (a lso referred to as the ecological or physical environment) 
relates to the limited natural resources from which an organisation obtains its raw 
materials. However, organisations also dispose of waste or some of their waste in the 
ecological environment. The  ecological environment consists of the natural environment, as 
well as human -made infrastructure. Geography, the weather and climate, the availability 
and exploitation of natural resources (raw materials, water, and so on), as well as 
conservation agreeme nts and conventions all form part of the natural environment. The 
human -made environment, in turn, refers to the roads, railways, airports, harbours, 
communication infrastructure and energy supplies that have an influence on all 
organisations.  
Organisation s are becoming increasingly aware of the natural environment and the 
interdependence between organisations and the natural environment. This interdependence 
presents opportunities and threats to organisations. One of the major  
21 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
threats is a shortage of natural resources, especially water and energy. The rising cost of 
energy, the cost of pollution, damage to a country’s natural resources and climate changes 
are all threats from the natural environment. Managers should take timely steps to ensure 
that no actions on the part of their organisation have detrimental effects on the 
environment. Sustainability issues, such as green industries, buildings and transport, have 
become crucial fo r strategic management.  
The global environment  
Globalisation and organisations conducting business across the borders of a country is a 
reality. The international environment poses threats, as well as opportunities for 
organisations. Strategic managers nee d to consider these for successful strategic 
management in contemporary organisations.  
Within the management environment discussed in this section, all managers, but 
strategic managers, in particular, need to be aware of the various stakeholders in the 
man agement environment. This is the focus of the following section.  
LO 7:  Explain the terms 'stakeholder' and ’stakeholder relationship management'.  
1.7 Stakeholders and stakeholder relationship 
management  
Various views exist in terms of who or what constitutes a  stakeholder of an organisation. 
The so -called narrow view of stakeholder theory refers to stakeholders as a group of 
individuals within the boundaries of the organisation. This view only considers 
stakeholders who are directly linked to the organisation, such as employees, customers and 
financial institutions. The broader view of stakeholder theory looks beyond the 
stakeholders within the organisation. It includes groups within the organisation, as well, as 
those on the outside, such as the community, loca l and national government.  
In this book, we will adopt Clarkson’s definition of organisational stakeholders:  
An organisation's stakeholders are the people or groups of people that have, or 
claim ownership, rights, or interests in an organisation and its ac tivities, past, 
present and future. Such claimed rights or interests are the result of transactions 
with, or actions taken by the organisation, and may be legal or moral, individual or 
collective. Stakeholders with similar interests, claims, or rights can be classified as 
belonging to the same group, for example, shareholders, employees, customer and 
suppliers .3 
In general, stakeholders are classified as external or internal. External stakeholders are 
those individuals or groups, who do not work directly wi thin the organisation, but who are 
affected by the strategies, plans and actions of the organisation. External stakeholders 
include the community, government, activist groups and not -for- 
22 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
profit organisations, competitors, the media, industry associates, organised labour, 
customers, suppliers, analysts, consultants and researchers.  
Internal stakeholders are stakeholders who work directly within  an organi sation. 
Internal stakeholders are shareholders/business owners, investors, employees and 
management.  
Traditionally, the primary goal of organisations was to realise a profit and thereby 
satisfy the needs and expectations of its owners (or shareh olders). Contemporary 
organisations adopt the triple -bottom line - an accounting framework with three parts, 
comprising the social, environmental (ecological) and financial parts. By adopting this 
framework, organisations evaluate their performance on a br oader perspective to create 
greater business value. The triple -bottom line not only focuses on the expectation of 
shareholders (profit), but simultaneously on the expectations of all stakeholders. Therefore, 
to be regarded as successful, an organisation ne eds to be (i) profitable; (ii) take 
responsibility for the physical environment in which it operates; and (iii) meet its social 
responsibilities.  
Management on all hierarchical levels should acknowledge the important role that 
stakeholders play in organisa tions. Strategic managers, especially, must take into account 
the impact that the organisation's vision, goals, strategies, projects and plans have on all 
stakeholders. Organisations are responsible for considering and protecting the rights and 
expectation s of all their stakeholders.  
At the same time, the influence that stakeholders have on the organisation should 
also be considered. This calls for a stakeholder relationship management process, which 
will bear tangible and intangible long -term rewards for t he organisation. For example, new 
products, new markets, stronger supply chains, a diverse workforce, and trusting 
relationships will all yield a competitive advantage for the organisation.  
In our discussion so far, we have referred a number of times to th e term competitive 
advantage,  which is a key term in strategic management.  
LO 8:  Differentiate  between  the terms 'competitive advantage', 'sustainable  
competitive advantage' and 'transient competitive advantage'.  
1.8 Competitive advantage, sustainable competitive 
advantage and transient competitive advantage  
In Section 1.6, we elaborated on the management environment. The market environment 
was identified as the environment comprising customers, competitors, the labour market 
and labour unions, intermed iaries and suppliers. In this environment, competition is taking 
place - organisations are competing for the same customers, suppliers, skilled labour and 
intermediaries. The most widely used framework for classifying and analysing these forces 
of competit ion in a specific industry was developed by Michael Porter of Harvard Business 
School.4 His framework views the profitability or  
23 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
attractiveness of an industry as determined by five sources of competitive pressure in the 
particular industry. These five sources are (1) competition from providers of substitute, 
products and/or services; (2) competition from new entrants or potential competitors; (3) 
competition from established rivals ( competitors); (4) the power of suppliers; and (5) the 
power of buyers.  
1. Competition from substitutes is influenced and determined by the buyers’ propensity to 
substitute or buy substitute products and the relative prices and performance of 
substitutes.  
2. Comp etition from new entrants or potential competitors to the industry is influenced by 
various factors, such as the capital needed to enter the industry, product 
differentiation, and legal barriers to enter the industry.  
3. Competition from established rivals (c ompetitors) in the industry is influenced by 
factors such as the diversity of these rivals, product differentiation to be found in the 
industry, exit barriers and cost conditions.  
4. The power of suppliers is also determined by various factors, for example, t he price 
sensitivity of suppliers and their relative bargaining power.  
5. Lastly, the power of buyers is influenced by factors such as competition between 
buyers, product differentiation, the information made available to buyers and the size 
and concentration  of buyers relative to suppliers.  
Once an organisation understands how the structure of the industry in which it operates 
drives competition in this industry, the profitability of the industry can be forecasted for 
the future. Determining industry structur e involves the identification of the main players in 
the industry - the producers, customers, suppliers, and producers of substitute products. An 
examination of the key characteristics of each of the main players will determine the 
competition in the indus try and bargaining power that we described in the previous 
paragraph. This analysis can subsequently be used to forecast industry profitability. Why? 
Organisations will only invest capital and other resources in an industry that meets its 
objectives in ter ms of profitability. Once an organisation understands the structure of its 
industry and have made forecasts of its profitability, strategies can be developed.  
The next crucial question that needs to be answered is how industry profit is shared 
among the different organisations competing in a particular industry? To answer this 
question, it requires an identification of the sources of competitive advantage within the 
particular industiy. We can use the term ‘key success factors’ to describe the factors in an 
industry that influence an organisation’s ability to outperform its rivals or competitors. 
Once an organisation understands the drivers of industry profitability, it can identify 
strategies through which it can improve industry attractiveness and positi on itself relative 
to its competitive forces. In essence, this means that an organisation can earn superior 
financial performance either by (1) locating in an attractive industry; or by (2) establishing 
a competitive advantage over its rivals. Of these two , competitive advantage is the most 
important since competition intensifies constantly across almost all industries so that very 
few 
24 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
industries can guarantee secure investment returns. Hence, we can conclude that the 
primary goal of a strategy is to establish a position of competitive advantage for the 
organisation. Stated differently, the primary goals of strategy is to put an organisation in a 
superior business position - which is a requirement for sustainability and survival over the 
long term.  
At this point, we need to provide a formal definition of the term ‘competitive 
advantage’. The literature provides us with numerous definitions, for exam ple: 
Competitive advantage is what makes you better than anyone else.5 
Competitive advantage are conditions that allow a company or country to produce 
a good or service at equal value but at a lower price or in a more desirable 
fashion. These conditions allow the productive entity to generate more sales or 
superior margins compared to its market rivals.6 
A superiority gained by an organization when it can provide the same value as its 
competitors but at a lower price, or can charge higher prices by provid ing greater 
value through differentiation. Competitive advantage results from matching core 
competencies to the opportunities?  
There is no one answer about what is competitive advantage or one way to 
measure it, and for the right reason. Nearly everything can be considered as 
competitive edge, eg higher profit margin, greater return on assets, valuable 
resource such as brand reputation or unique competence in producing jet engines. 
Every company must have at least one advantage to successfully compete in th e 
market. If a company can't identify one or just doesn't possess it, competitors soon 
outperform it and force the business to leave the market .8 
For the purposes of this chapter, we will define competitive advantage as follows:  
When two or more organisati ons compete within the same industry, one possesses 
a competitive advantage over its rivals when it performs (or has the potential to 
perform) better than its rivals.  
Common sources of competitive advantage are the following: barriers to entry, capital, cost 
advantage, customer satisfaction, digital maturity, distribution, know -how, market power, 
bargaining power, brand name, corporate governance, critical mass, design, distinctive 
capability, economic advantage, economies of scale, intellectual property,  sustainability, 
trade secrets, switching costs, market position, marketability, organisational culture, 
product development, risk management, technology and market position.  
Having a competitive advantage is the result of an organisation matching internal  
strengths to external key success factors. It is crucial to point out that competitive 
advantage is not something static and stable. In fact, competitive advantage is a 
disequilibrium phenomenon: it is created by change and, once established, it starts a 
competitive process that leads to its destruction.  
25 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
The changes that create competitive advantage, can be either internal or external. 
Internally, some organisations may, for example, have  a greater creative and innovative 
capability than their rivals that may lead to a competitive advantage. Externally, changes 
in, for example, customer demands or technology can create a competitive advantage for an 
organisation that is faster and more eff ective in exploiting change than its rivals.  
Once an organisation establishes competitive advantage, it is eroded by competition. 
The speed of this erosion will depend on the ability of competitors to challenge, either by 
imitation or by innovation. For a sustainable competitive advantage, the organisation must 
create barriers for other organisations to imitate and innovate its advantages. We therefore 
define a sustainable competitive advantage as:  
an organisation that has the ability to perform (or the pot ential to perform) better 
than its rivals over the long term.  
Organisations may have assets, attributes or abilities that are difficult to imitate or exceed 
which contribute to their competitive advantage. Competitive advantages are often short -
lived and i nstead of building one advantage and defending it, a transient strategy focuses on 
innovation strategies that continually build new advantages. Therefore, we define transient 
competitive advantage as follows:  
an organisation that has the ability to build u p temporary (or transient) 
advantages where they seize opportunities, exploit it, and then move quickly when 
they have exhausted the opportunity.  
Some of the competitive advantage of various South African companies are highlighted 
below.  
Practising strategy  
Woolworths  
Max Sonnenberg founded Woolworths in 1931. His belief that success lies in providing 
customers with superior quality merchandise at reasonable prices has been 
instrumental in establishing Woolworths as one of South Africa’s leading reta il chains - 
a benchmark for excellence and an icon of quality.9 
South African Breweries  
The South African Breweries Group, is one of the world’s largest beer distributors with 
a market share of 98 per cent in South Africa. The company is at the forefront i n 
addressing social inequities in its hiring, promoting, and training practices, and 
combating discrimination. The company's diverse workforce creates a global 
competitive advantage for the company.10 
26 CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
Edcon  
Edgars Consolidated Stores, commonly known as Edcon, is one of the country's most 
successful retail operations. The company firmly believes in the power of outsourced 
information technolo gy for competitive advantage. From an information technology 
point of view, that means that the company thoroughly analyses available 
technologies and options for how these are delivered to the business. A key 
contributor to the success of the organisation ’s IT strategy has been its decision to 
outsource substantial components of its infrastructure, data processing, systems 
development, security and storage capabilities. Since there is a shortage of 
technology skills in the country, the company believes it simply does not make sense 
for Edcon to develop expertise in -house. Their core focus is retail, so they look for 
partners that are experts in the field of IT so that the company can focus on an 
understanding of business principles that apply to their marke t and leave the 
technology in the hands of appropriately skilled suppliers. The company's ability to 
appoint appropriate expertise to take care of specialist functions is critical to achieve 
and sustain growth.11 
The big picture  
In this chapter, we highlig hted the relationship between various general management 
principles and strategic management. The background and information provided lay the 
foundation for the successful practising of strategy, which is the focus of the remainder of 
the book. Strategists  need to have a thorough understanding of the crucial role that 
strategic management plays in any business organisation. Without strategic management, 
the organisation is doomed for failure, as we have seen in the LeisureNet case study. 
Furthermore, strate gists need to have a thorough understanding of the management 
environment in which it operates. Competition in this environment is becoming more 
fierce, due to various factors such as globalisation and the use of technology to conduct 
business, to mention only a few. Therefore, the establishment of strategies that will ensure 
the sustainability and long -term survival of the organisation is crucial. The study of 
strategic management focuses on how organisations achieve this competitive advantage, in 
other wo rds how they achieve superior performance and sustainability over the long term. 
In Chapter 2, we will introduce you to the practice of strategy.  
Summary of learning outcomes  
LO 1: Explain the concepts ’manager' and 'management'.  
A manager as a person that  is responsible for running a part of or an entire organisation. 
Management is defined as the process of working with and through others to achieve 
organisational objectives in a changing environment. To be successful, organisations need 
managers performin g the management process.  
27 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
LO 2: Explain the management process, indicating the four characteristics 
thereof.  
The four characteristics of management are:  
(i) management is a process, consisting of four management functions namely 
planning, organising, leading and control;  
(ii) management entails working with and through others;  
(iii) management aims to contribute to the realisation of organisational goals and 
objectives, and in doing so management needs to balance effectiveness and 
efficiency and makes the most of limited and scarce resources; and  
(iv) management needs to cope with a changing environment.  
LO 3: Differentiate between the various levels of management.  
We differentiate between th e top, middle and lower levels of management. Top managers 
are responsible for strategic planning, implementation and control for the organisation as a 
whole. Middle managers are responsible for specific departments or functions of the 
organisation.  
Lower -level managers are responsible for even smaller segments of the organisation 
namely the various subsections.  
LO 4: Explain the various areas of management.  
Seven areas of management are distinguished, namely finance, operations, procurement, 
marketing, human resources, public relations and research and development.  
LO 5: Explain the hierarchy of organisational plans and depict it 
diagrammatically.  
The hierarchy of organisational plans consists of strategic, tactical, operational and 
individual plans. The  strategic plan comprises seven elements, namely the vision, mission, 
SWOT analysis, core values, objectives and strategies of the organisation. Tactical plans 
focus on the functional areas of the organisation, whereas operational plans focus on 
subsection s of the organisation, which may be single -use plans or standing plans. 
Individual plans are the translation of broader organisational plans into plans for the 
individual worker.  
LO 6: Explain the composition of the management environment.  
Structurally, the management environment can be divided into the micro -, market and 
remote environments. The micro -environment is the organisation itself over which 
management has control. It includes organisational functions, policies, strategies, goals, 
objectives, an d resources. The market environment is also referred to as the competitive 
environment and consists of customers, suppliers, labour and labour unions, and 
competitors.  CHAPTER 1: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
LO 7: Explain the terms 'stakeholder' and 'stakeholder relationship 
management'.  
An organisation’s stakeholders are the person or groups of people that have, or claim to 
have ownership, rights, or interests in an organisation and its a ctivities, past, present and 
future. Organisations need to manage its relationship with all stakeholders.  
LO 8: Differentiate between the terms 'competitive advantage’, 'sustainable 
competitive advantage' and 'transient competitive advantage'.  
When two or more organisations compete within the same industry, one possesses a 
competitive advantage over its rivals when it performs (or has the potential to perform) 
better than its rivals. Sustainable competitive advantage refers to an organisation that has 
the a bility to perform (or the potential to perform) better than its rivals over the long term. 
Organisations may have assets, attributes or abilities that are difficult to duplicate or 
exceed to lead to its competitive advantage. Competitive advantages are oft en short -lived 
and instead of building one advantage and defending it, a transient strategy focuses on 
innovation strategies that continually build new advantages. Organisations need to build up 
temporary or transient advantages where it seizes opportuniti es, exploit it, and then move 
quickly when it has exhausted the opportunity.  
Discussion questions  
1. Provide an explanation of the terms ‘manager’ and ‘management’. Is there a difference 
between contemporaiy views of these terms, compared to more traditional views?  
2. Explain the management process and highlight the most significant components of the 
process.  
3. Discuss the various levels and areas of management and highlight the most important 
responsibilities of each level and area of management.  
4. Explain the composition of the management environment and indicate the importance 
thereof in terms of strategic management.  
5. Explain the hierarchy of organisational plans and highlight the most important plans 
pertaining to each level of the hierarchy.  
6. Explain the term  ‘stakeholder’ and defend the importance of stakeholder relationship 
management in organisations, as well as the important role that strategists play in this.  
7. Differentiate between competitive advantage, sustainable competitive advantage and 
transient comp etitive advantage. Also, highlight the importance of these concepts in 
strategic management.

Strategy  
Organisations generally have an imperative to survive and to perform 
above the average - as we have indicated in Chapter 1. The study of 
strategic management focuses on how organisations achieve this 
competitive advantage, in other words, how they achieve superior 
performance and  sustainability over the long term. However, as the 
case study on Elon Musk suggests, the role of people in influencing 
strategy in the organisation cannot be underestimated.  
In this chapter, we review the origins of strategic management, 
identify and expl ain the universal principles of strategic management, 
define strategy, explain how the success of strategy can be measured, 
and describe a contemporary strategic management framework.  Case study  
Elon Musk - Leading with Vision  
In 2006, Elon Musk announced in a blog his 'master plan' for sustainable mass transport. This 
entailed:  
¦ creating a low -volume1 car, which would necessarily be expensive.  
¦ using  that money to develop a medium -volume car at a lower  price.  
¦ using  that money to create an  affordable, high -volume car.  
¦ providing solar power.  
As one of the most admired technology entrepreneurs in the world, South African -born Musk 
is known for his vision to rid the world of fossil fuels, and Tesla's electric vehicles and solar 
power technolog ies are ways of doing just that. Musk's plan unfolded over the last decade or 
so first with the development of the Tesla S, an expensive, high -performing sports car, and then  moving into the second phase of the plan with the  development  of 
the Tesla  X and  Tesla Roadster. 
Most recently, Tesla announced the Tesla  3, an affordable  
electric car, and with advance orders of more than 400,000 cars, it would seem as if the 
master plan is on track. In the meantime, Tesla also launched various products for residentia l 
and business solar energy production, such as the Powerwall battery system, solar panels and 
a ‘solar roof, and their SolarCity business is now the second -largest solar provider in the US. 
In support of his businesses, Tesla built a Gigafactory (with Pan asonic) for producing lithium -
ion batteries for use in battery farms and electric cars.  
When pursuing of his vision for a sustainable planet, Musk does not hesitate in sharing 
his ideas and technologies freely and in thinking out of the box. He made Tesla Motors' 
patents available to the industry for free, and has explicitly open -sourced the Hyperloop2 
train concept so that others can take the ideas and further develop them. In addition, he is 
striving to make travel to Mars affordable with Space -X and to e stablish a space colony on 
Mars.  
Musk is often described as a transformational leader who has the following qualities:  
¦ The capacity to think beyond what seems possible or viable today.  
¦ The ability to make people believe in his vision, no matter how far -fetched it may 
seem.  
¦ Leading by example - excellence is non -negotiable.  
¦ A relentless (even obsessive) drive towards results - failure is not an option.  
However, leaders like Musk are not always easy to work with. The amazing vision and drive 
that contribute to Musk's leadership style sometimes mean that 'an engineer might spend 
nine months working 100 hours a week on something because Musk pushed him to, and 
then out of nowhere, Musk will change his mind and scrap the project'.  
32 CHAPTER 2:  INTRODUCING THE PRACTICE OF STRATEGY  
In 2016, Musk updated his master plan to:  
1. Create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage.  
2. Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major [consumer] segments.  
3. Develop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual capability via 
massive fleet learning.  
4. Enable your car to make money for you when you aren't using it.  
With his  track record up to this point, it would unwise to bet against him achieving  
exactly what he sets out to do.

LO 1:  Explain  the origins  of strategic  management.  
2.1 The origins of strategic management  
While strategy is an ancient concept,3 strategic management, as we know it today, 
originated in the late 1970s following a move away from corporate planning to a more 
externally focused process. Strategic management was characterised by a focus on 
competition as the key driving force in the bu siness environment and profit maximisation 
as the primary goal of the organisation. The process of strategic management accordingly 
focused on the selection of markets and on the positioning of the organisation in its chosen 
markets relative to its competi tors as a source of competitive advantage (ie superior 
performance over the long term). Initially, the focus of strategic management was to 
determine how the organisation could tap into sources of profit in an industry by virtue of 
its industry positioning . For example, by creating clear differentiation from its 
competitors, organisations could be in a position to charge higher prices for the perceived 
higher quality. This view, with Michael Porter4 as its main proponent (which we discussed 
in Chapter 1, Se ction 1.8), was predominant until the 1990s and is still prominent in 
strategy texts to this day.  
In the 1990s, the resource -based view (RBV) emerged as the dominant perspective on 
how organisations could achieve a competitive advantage. In accordance with  the RBV, an 
organisation’s internal resources and capabilities were the most important sources of profit 
and competitive advantage. The focus of strategic management accordingly shifted to 
understanding how organisations differed from their competitors (i n terms of what 
capabilities they possessed) and how these differences could be leveraged for competitive 
advantage.5 
Our understanding of how organisations practise strategic management and how they 
develop competitive advantage and organisational sustain ability (the ability of the 
organisation to survive and outperform rivals in the long run) is shaped by our  
33 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
environment (which we discussed in Chapter 1, Section 1.6} and is constantly ev olving. 
For example, in the aftermath of a string of corporate scandals internationally, as well as 
locally (such as Enron, Fidentia and the Steinhoff scandal), the global financial crisis of 
2008 and 2009, and the current state of governance in South Afri ca (such as the widely 
publicised problems in many state -owned companies like Eskom, South African Airways 
(SAA) and the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), there is a strong focus on 
responsible and ethical corporate behaviour (which we referre d to in Chapter 1 as the 
‘triple -bottom line’).  
In this book, we emphasise the importance of the environment, and the resources and 
capabilities of the organisation. At the same time, we recognise that strategic management 
is a dynamic discipline and that its key influences and debates change over time. However, 
while our understanding of the focus of strategic management and competitive advantage 
has evolved, the strategic management process itself has not always enjoyed the same 
attention. In this book, w e argue that the strategic management process is also a fluid and 
changing concept. While there are many different views on how strategic management 
should be done, there are certain common principles that underlie the various views of 
strategy and strateg ic management. In the next section, we review these common principles.  
LO 2:  Identify and explain the universal principles of strategic management.  
2.2 The universal principles of strategic 
management  
Most lecturers involved in teaching strategic management ha ve experienced a situation in 
which students complain that the way strategic management is taught is different from the 
way it actually happens in their organisations. This could be seen as a sign of the 
theory/practice divide, and as reflective of the com plexity of strategic management. More 
recently, the study of strategic management started to catch up to the practice of strategic 
management. Despite this complexity, there are some principles that are common to all 
views of strategic management, and we d iscuss these principles below, by using the 
example of Discovery Bank as it illustrates the application of these principles.  
34  
CHAPTER 2: INTRODUCING THE PRACTICE OF STRATEGY  
Practising strategy  
Discovery moves into retail banking6 
Discovery is a large, listed, financial services institution operating through Discovery 
Health (DH), Discovery Life (DL), Discovery Invest (Dl), short -term insurer Discovery 
Insure, and the very popular and successful Discovery Vitality (a wellness loyal ty 
programme). In addition, it has operations in the USA, where it licenses Vitality for use 
by employers and other health insurers, and in the UK, where it operated two joint 
ventures (JVs) with the Prudential pic - PruHealth and Prulife. Its core purpose  is ‘to 
make people healthier, and enhance and protect their lives'. Discovery is generally 
known for its innovativeness. For example, they are credited with the invention of the 
medical savings plan used widely by medical schemes today.  
In 2015, Discovery  received authorisation from the Registrar of Banks to 
establish banking operations in South Africa, and launched its banking products in 
2019. This is according to Discovery CEO Adrian Gore, who said they are deep into the 
preparation phase of the new ban k. Gore said it is a complicated process to assemble 
the right team, build the systems to support the bank, and develop products which 
banking clients need. Despite the complications, he remains upbeat about the 
prospects of Discovery Bank - saying it is a n exciting project.  
’We need to meet the needs of our customers. I think we can. We have strong 
ideas and convictions about that. If we can do that, the market will tell us,' said Gore.  
Gore said they had tremendous success with their joint venture with FN B on the 
Discovery Card, which provides them with a launchpad for full banking services.  
'We've got the capital, we've hired bankers, we're building substantial systems. 
We want to make an offering that's relevant and can win market share,' said Gore.  
Discovery has an advantage over the big four traditional banks, as it does not 
have to maintain a country -wide network of branches and ATMs. This means Discovery 
Bank's costs will be lower than its competitors.  
2.2.1  Principle 1: Strategy is about positive change  
Strategic management is ultimately about positive change for the organisation as a whole. 
Positive change includes achieving superior performance, creating competitive advantage, 
creating shareholder wealth above the average, meeting the needs of all stake holders (you 
may refer back to Chapter 1, Section 1.5 where we differentiated between shareholders and 
stakeholders), or, in some instances, just surviving in difficult times. It is also worth 
noting that it is about change, and managing such change, and n ot about just doing things 
as they have always been done (ie 'business as usual’). For example, the decision by 
Discovery to launch Discovery Bank7 reflects Discovery’s view that they will be able to 
use their expertise in the financial services industry a nd their loyal customer base to 
compete successfully in the retail banking industry and to create value for the owners of 
the group.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
2.2.2  Principle 2: Strategy takes a long -term view  
Strategy is about taking a long -term view and ultimately focusing on wealth creation and 
sustainability over the long term, rather than on merely creating quick wins or short -term 
gains.  
2.2.3  Principle 3: Strategy is complex  
Strategy is highly complex and is associated with high levels of uncertainty and risk. There 
are no easy answers, no recipes for success, and it is highly situated, meaning that it is 
different for every context. In other words, strategic management is about making big 
decisions during situations of high uncertainty and having to consider many different 
variables. Should strategic decisions fail, there may be very severe negative consequences 
for the organisation, so the risk is enormous. Discovery worked for some years on 
establishing Discovery Bank,  and invested a lot of time and money into getting the 
necessary approvals and license, appointing the right personnel and establishing 
infrastructure. Should the bank not perform as envisaged, it could mean that this capital 
investment was not justified, and Discovery could end up losing a great deal of money.  
2.2.4  Principle 4: Strategy has an internal and external 
focus  
Strategy is about mobilising resources and capabilities inside the organisation to pursue 
opportunities outside of the organisation, or to res pond to negative risks timeously. This 
typically means that strategic decision -makers have to understand the resources and 
capabilities of the organisation, and how it needs to change over time to keep up with a 
changing and unpredictable external environm ent. In the case of Discovery Bank, the board 
of Discovery felt that their internal resources and capabilities (such as their loyal customer 
base, their Vitality loyalty programme, innovation capabilities and their experience in the 
insurance industry) wou ld enable them to pursue the perceived external opportunity in the 
retail banking industry.  
2.2.5  Principle 5: Strategy is both deliberate and emergent  
Organisations have very important formal processes to create deliberate strategies. 
Deliberate strategies are those strategies that the organisation intends to pursue in order to 
achieve its long -term goals. Hence, we often consider strategy as something abstract, as 
something that an organisation possesses, for example, ‘the strategy of company X is cost 
leadersh ip’. However, there is increasing recognition that strategising is also a human 
activity, something that people do in organisations every day. The acts and decisions of 
strategists may lead to an ‘emergent’ strategy that is different from what the organisa tion 
intended. Robert Grant suggests that strategy exists in three places: the heads of managers, 
in the talk and documents they produce,  
36 CHAPTER 2: INTRODUCING THE PRACTICE OF STRATEGY  
and in their actions. Only the latter two are obs ervable.8 This perspective implies that, if 
we are to understand strategy and strategic management, we have to understand who the 
strategists are, and how and why they make decisions and do what they do rather than 
focusing only on strategy at an abstract level. In fact, the realised strategy may often end 
up being quite different from the intended strategy. People do not act like rational robots, 
but that their strategic acts (and, by implication, strategy) are fuelled by who and what they 
are, as well as by cognition (rationality) and politics, the quest for power. In the opening 
case study, it is clear that Elon Musk’s way of doing things plays a considerable role in the 
success of Tesla.  
While top managers undoubtedly play a key role in the success of st rategic 
management, the emerging strategy perspective suggests that top managers alone are not 
the only strategists. Any individual or group in the organisation that controls key or 
precedent -setting actions9 can be regarded as a strategist. Accordingly, w e can extend our 
perspective of strategists to include non -executive directors, strategic planners, middle 
managers and consultants. Through their own interpretations of strategy, or their own 
actions, these role players can influence the allocation of res ources. It is, therefore, 
important to consider their role. Certain methodologies and systems can also be used to 
facilitate strategising, for example, strategy workshops and projects.  
2.2.6  Principle 6: Strategy involves various different 
thought processes  
The process perspectives of strategy often present it as orderly, analytical, rational and 
neat, and also as deliberate - a path that is chosen and pursued efficiently. In fact, there is 
much evidence to the contrary. Strategy is often emergent rather than del iberate, messy 
rather than neat, and experimental and fraught with failure rather than efficient and 
effective from the start. So, while there are elements of the strategy process that are 
designed to be rational and cognitive (eg conducting strategy works hops), there are a 
myriad of social interactions inside and outside of the workplace that influence the 
activities and decisions of strategists. There are different thought processes at work in 
strategic management. In fact, strategy is often referred to a s both an art and a science, 
suggesting that it incorporates both a rational, analytical element, as well as an element of 
creativity. In addition, there are often power issues at work in strategy, where individuals 
or groups compete for power. As alluded to earlier, strategy work is about verbal and 
written communication. Strategists need to be able to use persuasive language and 
arguments, and be able to build a coherent story of strategy from the snippets of 
conversation taking place all over the organis ation.10 In addition, documents such as 
strategic plans, operational plans and strategy presentations are important forms of 
discourse that can influence the strategy and strategic decision -making.  
Since the term ‘strategic thinking’ is used so often, it i s useful to consider what it 
means. Figure 2.1 is a comparison of some characteristics of strategic thinking with non -
strategic thinking. Strategic thinking is typically focused on the future and represents a 
certain willingness to take calculated risks. S trategic thinkers are also generally more 
creative, flexible and pro -active than non -strategic thinkers.

2.2.7  Principle 7: Strategy happens at different hierarchical 
levels  
In large multi -business organisations, strategic management and decision -making takes 
place at different levels. Table 2.1 compares strategic management and decis ion-making on 
corporate, business and functional levels of an organisation in terms of (1) where the 
decision -making takes place, (2) the scope of the decision, (3) the responsible people, and 
(4) the goals thereof. At the highest level, decisions about th e growth path of the 
organisation are made by the board of directors or other governing bodies. This level of 
strategy is known as corporate -level strategy and the focus is on creating stakeholder value. 
It is at this level that decisions are made about th e scope of the organisation, for example, 
mergers, acquisitions, divestments and globalisation. The decision by Discovery to enter 
the banking industry is an example of a corporate strategic decision.  
Business -level strategy takes place at the level of the  single business or business 
unit (eg a subsidiary) and the goal is for it to achieve competitive advantage within the 
markets in which it is competing. It supports corporate -level strategy by ensuring that it is 
successful in its markets, and draws on the  corporate centre to provide it with the means to 
compete successfully. Business unit managers are responsible for attaining the overall goal 
of the organisation. In the case of Discovery Bank, the company will hope that with access 
to their existing custo mer base, corporate capabilities and Discovery’s Vitality loyalty 
programme, it will be able to compete successfully in the banking industry.  
Functional strategies, such as human resource or marketing strategies, are developed 
by functional managers to exe cute the business unit strategies developed by business unit 
managers, and to support the implementation of business strategies. For example, in setting 
up Discovery Bank, the human resource strategy in hiring the right talent to staff the bank 
is going to  be crucial to its success.

Bidvest provides us with an example of the different levels of strategy that can be found in 
multi -business organisations.  
Practising strategy: Bidvest's 
corporate strategy11 
Bidvest is a South African corporation that focuses on using diversification and 
innovation to grow their portfolio of successful, cash -generating businesses in consumer 
and industrial products, electrical products, financial services, freight management, 
office and print solutions, outsourced hard and soft services, travel and aviation services 
and automotive retailing.  
The company uses acquisitions to invest in a blend of defensive, cyclical and 
growth assets; they prefer businesses that generate cash and  are not heavily invested in 
assets, and are aiming to internationalise in certain niche markets in services and 
commercial products.  
The company is aiming to establish dominant positions in each of the markets 
they operate in with broad product offerings.  Bidvest prides itself on having a highly 
entrepreneurial and decentralised management and operations, and a strong record of 
efficient capital allocation to the businesses they own.  
In contrast to the Bidvest head office, where corporate strategies are id entified 
and decisions are made in terms of the scope of the organisation, the role of Bidvest 
businesses is to ensure that they compete successfully in their industries. Bidvest's 
business goal is to achieve competitive advantage in its various markets. W ithin each 
business unit, functional managers need to execute business unit strategies so that they 
can compete successfully in its market. For example, Bidvest Car Rental must have 
business level strategies and functional strategies to ensure that they co mpete 
successfully against other car rental companies.

LO 3:  Define  strategy  and explain  its importance  to the organisation.  
2.3 Defining strategy  
In this section, we consider some key aspects and describe what we mean by strategy, as 
seen from our perspective.  
2.3.1  What does it mean to be 'strategic?  
Not all actions and decisions in an organisation can be considered ‘strategic’.  
Strategic goal 
C 
 
Figure 2.2 Strategy versus business as usual12 
Consider Figure 2.2. If we take point A as where we are today, and we carry on doing what 
we are doing (ie business as usual) and we are somewhat lucky, we may end up at point B, 
in a slightly better position than we are today and perhaps, if we are very lucky, in a 
position where we are better off than our competitors. It is also quite possible that we will 
end up in exactly the sam e or even in a worse position than where we are today. However, 
we can set ourselves a long -term strategic goal (point C) that, if achieved, will take us 
considerably beyond where we are today and possibly even beyond our competitors - in 
other words, it w ill give us a competitive advantage that will lead to long -term survival. 
The difference between point B and point C is ‘strategy’; those actions that will help us 
achieve our strategic goals. Strategic goals are also known as long -term or strategic 
object ives. Being ‘strategic’ thus involves the following:  
¦ It is not ‘business as usual’ - we cannot simply keep doing what we have been 
doing for years and years and describe it as ‘strategic’.  
¦ It reaches across all business functions, that is, it is an organis ation -wide issue, 
and across all managerial levels.  
¦ It is not a quick fix or a small change. It requires a large, sustained change effort 
over a long period of time.  
¦ It requires a large commitment of resources - it is not cheap or easy.  
40 CHAPTER 2: INTRODUCING THE PRACTICE OF STRATEGY  
¦ While it may not be the domain of top management only, and it may be 
influenced by many other people, top management is ultimately responsible for 
achieving strategic goals (or for failing to achieve them) as we indicated in 
Chapter 1, Section 1.3.  
2.3.2  The importance of strategy  
Strategy is a coherent story about the future direction of the organisation. It provides 
members of the organisation with a framework to guide decision -making processes.  
The strategic ma nagement process should combine the views and thinking of many 
members of the organisation and communicates the outcome back to the organisation so 
that everyone follows the same strategy.  
Strategy is, in a sense, the verbalisation of the organisation’s as pirations and 
accordingly provides an inspirational element that may be far removed from the realities of 
the present. In this sense, a good strategy can inspire, unite and motivate members of the 
organisation.  
2.3.3  Defining strategy  
Strategy has been described  variously as the long -term direction of the organisation, a 
pattern in a stream of decisions,13 the means by which organisations achieve their 
objectives and the deliberate choice of a set of activities to achieve competitive 
advantage.14 These definition s make provision for both deliberate choices and for 
unplanned and emerging strategies. However, if we accept the idea that strategy is a 
conversation, we can imagine that strategy is shaped by ongoing discussions about the 
future of the organisation, and that strategy may simply be a believable story about the 
future of the organisation. What all of these definitions have in common is the notion of a 
direction for the future, whether it is a ‘pattern’ that can be recognised from the activities 
and decision s of the organisation, a deliberate choice of a set of activities, or the steps 
taken to achieve strategic goals.  
Building on these definitions, and accepting that strategy is primarily a human 
activity, we define strategy in this book as the direction pro vided by the actions and decisions 
of strategists in pursuit of organisational goals.  
2.3.4  Defining strategic management  
Traditionally, strategic management has been defined as setting strategic direction, setting 
goals, crafting a strategy, implementing and ex ecuting the strategy, and then over time and 
through a controlling process, initiating whatever corrective adjustments and corrections 
are deemed appropriate. However, more recent views have suggested that strategy is not 
this sequential and discrete, but is somewhat messier, overlapping and iterative. 
Independent of the process followed to develop and manage strategy, the purpose of 
strategic management is to ensure that the organisation applies the following four key 
elements:  
41 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
1. Clear and consistent long -term strategic direction in terms of what the organisation 
wants to achieve in the future.  
2. A profound understanding of the external environment to ensure that the 
organisation is abl e to align itself with opportunities and to deal with threats as 
effectively as possible.  
3. An objective knowledge of the key resources and capabilities the organisation 
possesses, as well as its value to enable the organisation to build on these and 
develop  a distinct competitive advantage.  
4. The proper alignment of organisational structure, systems, culture, and functional 
and operational management (collectively referred to as organisational 
architecture) to ensure the effective implementation of strategic p lans, portfolios, 
programmes, projects and initiatives.  
Strategic management is ultimately about consistently aligning the organisation with its 
internal and external environments, as shown in Figure 2.3. In this figure, strategic direction  
refers to the l ong-term goals of the organisation which can be expressed as, for example, 
vision and mission statements. It relates to the key elements against which all strategic 
decisions should be measured.  
¦ External consistency refers to the extent to which the organisation’s strategy is aligned 
with the opportunities and threats in the external environment (refer to the components 
of the external environment explained in Chapter 1, Section 1.6). Significant changes 
in the external environment will most likely re quire some changes in strategy.  
¦ Dynamic consistency measures the extent to which the strategy of the organisation is 
consistent with the key resources and capabilities of the organisation in its micro -
environment (refer to the components of the internal en vironment explained in Chapter 
1, Section 1.6). In other words, is the organisation making the best possible use of its 
resources and capabilities to benefit from opportunities and to avoid having to deal 
with threats.  
¦ Internal consistency addresses the ex tent to which the organisational architecture (such 
as structure, systems, human resources, technology and processes) are aligned with the 
strategy. It also considers whether planning at lower levels of management in the 
organisation is broadly aligned wit h strategy. In this view of strategic management, 
strategising can be seen as the efforts of strategists to ensure consistency on all three 
levels of management and within the boundaries of the strategic goals of the 
organisation. Strategising will require  strategic decisions to be made, and this is the 
focus of the next section.  
42 CHAPTER 2: INTRODUCING THE PRACTICE OF STRATEGY  
 
Figure 2.3 Successful strategic management: striving for consistency  
LO 4:  Identify  the characteristics  of strategic  decision -making,  and provide guidelines  
to strategic decision -makers to aid them in making better strategic decisions.  
2.4 Strategic decisions  
Strategic decisions that strategists need to make are influenced by two factors, cognitive 
and rational aspects, as well as political processes. These are explained below.  
¦ Cognitive and rational aspects. The term ‘cognitive functioning’  refers to an 
individual’s ability to perform various mental activities associated with learning, 
problem -solving and decision -making. Strategists, as important problem -solvers and 
decision -makers in an organisation, should adopt a logical approach and try  to be as 
objective as possible when they are solving problems and making decisions. When 
making decisions, strategists could consider two primary decision -making models, 
namely the rational and the bounded -rationality model. In the case of the rational 
model, the strategist should select the best possible solution to the problem - known as 
optimising. However, while the rational view is strongly emphasised in the prevailing 
views of strategy, it has been recognised that managers are generally restricted by  
their own information - processing capabilities, which brings us to the second decision -
making model, namely ‘bounded rationality’. This refers to a situation in which 
strategists use satisficing and select the first possible solution to a problem that mee ts 
the minimal criteria. Strategists should know which model to use and when. They 
should optimise - apply the rational model - when making high -risk decisions in 
conditions of uncertainty. When they are making low -risk decisions, they should 
select the fi rst option that meets the minimal criteria.14 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
¦ Political processes. Strategists will not necessarily agree on the best course of action 
to achieve strategic goals and may use their sphere of power and influence or 
persuasive (or dissuasive) language to sway others towards their preference. This is 
known as political behaviour in organisations. Strategists are ultimately, like all 
human beings, social and political beings, influenced by their b ackgrounds (eg 
education, culture and religion) and personalities in their quest for status and power. It 
is, therefore, almost impossible to expect strategic decisions to be entirely objective 
and rational.  
In environments where fast strategic decision -making is required, the following guidelines 
can aid strategists in their decision -making processes:15 
¦ Developing more than one alternative course of action or solution to a problem. 
This will help minimise the influence of politicking. Strategy simulations can be 
used to improve the strategists’ abilities to generate and evaluate alternatives 
more quickly.  
¦ Getting real -time information. Instead of waiting for formal reports, fast decision 
makers obtain the information they need from operational data and by i nformal 
discussions with other managers and members of the organisation.  
¦ Relying on experience and trusted advisers. This entails not depending on junior 
managers and consultants for analyses, but developing a network of trusted and 
proven advisors.  
¦ Trying  to reach consensus, but not at all costs. There will be occasions when there 
is simply not enough time to establish consensus, and the majority should, at 
some point, make a decision.  
In strategic decision -making, it is sometimes important to remember tha t it is ‘better to be 
vaguely right than exactly wrong’,16 meaning that the time and cost associated with more 
accurate information will not always be of equal benefit in the decision making process. In 
the next section, we will consider the question of ho w the success of strategy can be 
measured.  
LO 5:  Explain  how the success  of strategy  can be measured.  
2.5 How do we measure the success of strategy?  
Competitive advantage and sustainability are often mentioned in the same context. 
However, the measure of strat egic success is not always a simple matter. On the one hand, 
there are proponents of shareholder capitalism, who suggest that the creation of shareholder 
wealth through profitability is and should remain the only measure of strategic success. 
However, shar eholder capitalism and the drive for ‘profit at all cost’ were heavily 
implicated as a leading cause of the 2008 -2009 global economic crisis, with detractors 
suggesting that an excessive focus on profits (and especially short term profits) was not 
sustaina ble. 
44 CHAPTER 2: INTRODUCING THE PRACTICE OF STRATEGY  
On the other hand, the stakeholder approach  (explained in Chapter 1, Section 1.7) requires a 
focus on balancing the often -conflicting needs of multiple stakeholders such as employees, 
shareholders, the environment and local communities. While we increasingly see large 
corporations embracing the con cept and reporting, not only on their financial results, but 
also on their social and environmental contributions (so - called ‘triple -bottom line’ 
reporting), the stakeholder approach is criticised for vastly increasing the complexity of 
strategic decision -making and diluting the strategic goals of the organisation.  
Michael Jensen proposes that the two approaches should meet somewhere in the 
middle, and that ultimately enlightened shareholder value maximisation is exactly the same 
as enlightened stakeholder  theory.17 
LO 6:  Discuss  a contemporary strategic management framework.  
2.6 A contemporary strategic management 
framework  
Although we acknowledge the contribution of traditional strategic management 
perspectives to our understanding of this important field, we  also acknowledge that we 
need to incorporate newer thinking in our perspective of strategic management. To this 
end, we have devised the contemporary framework of strategic management (Figure 2.4) 
which serves as the framework for this book. This model, a nd the outline of the book are 
discussed in more detail below.  
In Section 2.2, we identified various universal principles of strategic manage ment. 
One of these principles was that strategy is both deliberate and emergent (as indicated in 
Section 2.2.5). F rom a deliberate strategy perspective, strategy drives organisational 
architecture and it is the job of managers responsible for implementing strategy to ensure 
that the elements of organisational architecture (such as structure and culture) are aligned 
with the chosen strategy. From an emergent strategy perspective, we argue that 
organisational architecture is so influential that it affects strategy formation profoundly. In 
our view, there is constant tension between strategy formation and organisational 
architecture, and this is depicted in Figure 2.4. We can think of this as a tug of war 
between strategy formation and organisational architecture. Sometimes, the strategy 
formation process is going to dominate and the architecture is going to follow. For 
example, Discovery’s decision to invest in retail banking, requires them to make the 
necessary changes to ensure that their organisational architecture is aligned with the new 
direction of the organisation. At other times, the organisational architecture mig ht lead and 
the strategy might follow. In the case of the South African Post Office, for example (see 
the practising strategy box below), we could argue that their existing national branch 
infrastructure, capabilities, and especially the tenacious efforts of CEO Mark Barnes, have 
a lot more to do with their bid to take on the Sassa business that it being a deliberate 
predetermined strategy.  
45  
PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Practising strategy: Sassa and Post Office 
secure social grants deal '8 
The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) and the South African Post Office 
(Sapo) have reached a 'landmark' agreement to ensure social grant beneficiaries 
continue to receive their payments after Sassa’s contract with Ca sh Paymaster Services 
(CPS) ends on 31 March 2018, Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe announced on 
Sunday morning.  
In a setback to the ambitions of Sapo CEO Mark Barnes, who had hoped Sapo's 
Postbank would be the sole service provider, it is to be just  one of four payment 
channels available to social grant recipients. The hybrid model the parties agreed to 
will also enable beneficiaries to receive their monthly payments via bank accounts at 
commercial banks, merchants in large retail shops, and a 'secon d tier’ of merchants 
that includes village banks, general dealers, small retail outlets, and spaza shops. The 
hybrid model will be phased in over five years.  
Sapo would provide cash disbursements through its branch network, 
particularly in locations close enough to replace existing cash pay points, he said. At 
present 2.9 million, a little less than a third (29%) of all grant beneficiaries, receive cash 
payments.  
2.6.1  Strategy formation  
In this book, we use the term strategy formation deliberately. Most textbooks refer to the 
formal process of developing a strategy as strategy formulation. However, as we take both 
the formal and informal elements of strategy development into account, strategy formation 
is a more accurate term. Strategy formation consists of three elements, namely, process, 
context and content.  
¦ Process. In the first place, there are a number of processes that can be both formal and 
informal, involved in the development of develop strategy. They relate to the question 
‘how’ strategy develops  in the organisation, and is the focus of Chapter  
3. We also examine strategists and strategising in more detail in this section (and 
Chapter 4), as the practices and communication of strategists at all levels 
(‘strategising’) influence how strategy is formed . Strategising can contribute towards 
both strategy formation and the shaping of organisational architecture. For example, 
middle managers, in their interactions with customers, may realise that there is an 
opportunity to expand the product range of the or ganisation and canvas top managers 
to affect it. Or, regional managers may realise that there is a problem with the 
structure of the organisation and how it supports the strategy, and may influence role -
players to make the required changes.  CHAPTER 2: INTRODUCING THE PRACTICE OF STRATEGY  
¦ Context. Strategy is always context -bound. In other words, it takes place in a certain 
internal and external context, and this provides us with the ‘why’ of strategy. For 
example, a busines s in Botswana has to contend with the global context, the 
continental context, regional issues, country issues, the industry it is competing in, 
and with what is happening within the organisation. This external context and the 
risks it present will be expl ored in more depth in Chapter 5, while the internal context 
and the strategic resources and capabilities of the organisation will be the focus of 
Chapter 6.  
¦ Content. The content of strategy refers to the actual development of strategies (the 
‘what’, in other words) to compete in industries and to create shareholder value, and 
we will examine this aspect in more depth in Chapter 7.  
2.6.2  Strategy implementation  
Strategy implementation consists of three important elements, namely change management, 
organisationa l learning, and resource allocation.  
¦ Change management. The alignment of organisational architecture with strategy 
formation does not happen naturally, and the organisation has to put in place formal 
processes to manage the large -scale change associated wi th strategy. This aspect is 
explored in Chapter 8.  
¦ Organisational learning. This relates to the less formal processes of organisational 
learning to recognise and respond to the need for change is discussed in Chapter 9.  
¦ Resource allocation. The allocation of resources to portfolio, programmes, projects 
and organisational structures responsible for giving effect to strategy is the topic of 
Chapter 10.  
2.6.3  Strategic control  
Continuous environmental scanning (both formal and informal) helps to ensure monitoring 
and control processes. On the one hand, environmental scanning and control need to ensure 
that the planned strategy is on track and to alert key decision makers if interventions are 
required. This is represented by the arrow from left to right. On the other hand, leaders, 
strategists and other role -players in the organisation (eg market intelligence experts) may 
pick up signals from the environment that could affect the strategy formation process. This 
is represented by the arrow from right to left. This aspe ct is examined in more depth in 
Chapter 14.  
2.6.4  Organisational architecture  
Organisational architecture is a management tool that is used to describe the workings of 
an organisation, especially with regard to the alignment of strategy and the organisation.19 
It is a model of the organisation that can be shared by everyone involved in managing 
change and aligning strategy with structure. There are many  
47  
PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
different perspectives on or ganisational architecture and what it comprises, but for 
purposes of this book, we have focused on the four main elements, namely culture, 
leadership and governance, structure, and resources and capabilities.  
¦ Culture. Peter Drucker once said that ‘culture eats strategy for breakfast’.20 This 
observation suggests that culture is so powerful that no plan will work if it is counter 
to the culture of the organisation. In Chapter 11, we focus on organisational culture 
and its vital role in aligning strategy and organisational architecture.  
¦ Leadership and governance. Chapter 12 deals with the closely related issue of 
leadership and its role in strategy implementation and governance.  
¦ Structure. The structure of the organisation refers to the physical manifestation of the 
organisation in terms of geographical distribution, positions, reporting and 
communication lines, and so on. The role of structure in the alignment of structure and 
strategy is the topic of Chapter 13.  
Resources and capabilities  
The success of organ isations is dependent on them possessing unique strategic resources 
and valuable capabilities that form the foundation upon which the organisations are built 
and can grow. The role of resources and capabilities in the alignment of structure and 
strategy is  the topic of Chapter 5.

48 CHAPTER 2: INTRODUCING THE PRACTICE OF STRATEGY  
The big picture  
In this chapter, we proposed that strategy is generally a messier process with more 
participants than conventional perspectives of strategy, as a formal process, would suggest. 
In developing our perspective, we suggested that a variety of strategists contribute, 
through their strategising activities, to ensure that the organisation is continually aligned 
(through its strategic choices) with its exte rnal and internal environment. In examining 
strategy, we also adopted the perspective that the context of Africa is a critical influence 
on strategising and strategy, and suggested that organisational sustainability (the ability to 
sustain resources and th e uses thereof] is a key goal of any organisation. Table 2.2 is a 
summary comparison of the conventional approach to strategic management and our 
approach in this book.  
Summary of learning outcomes  
LO 1: Explain the origins of strategic management.  
In Sect ion 2.1, we discussed the evolution of strategy as a military concept to the notion of 
strategic management as a concept utilised by modern businesses in the pursuit of 
competitive advantage.  
LO 2: Identify and explain the universal principles of strategic  
management  
While there may be many different perspectives of what strategy is, Section 2.2 introduces 
seven principles of strategic management that most academics and practitioners of strategic 
management agree on.  
LO 3: Define strategy and explain its importance to the organisation.  
In Sections 2.3.1 through 2.3.4, we explain what it means to be strategic, and develop 
definitions for ‘strategy’ and ‘strategic management’. We also explore the importance of 
strategy and the organisation’s strategic manage ment.  
LO 4: Identify the characteristics of strategic decision -making, and provide 
guidelines to strategic decision -makers to aid them in making better 
strategic decisions.  
Strategic decisions are complex and there are no clear ‘right’ answers. In Section 2.4, we 
outline the rational and cognitive aspects, as well as the political aspects of strategic 
decisions, and provide guidelines for ‘good’ strategic decision -making.  
LO 5: Explain how the success of strategy can be measured.  
he business world is filled  with examples of the negative effects of pursuing short term 
profits above all else. In Section 2.5, we explain that strategy should always be a out the 
long term and creating value for stakeholders (ie sustainability), rather than about short -
term profits.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
LO 6: Discuss a contemporary strategic management framework.  
In Section 2.6,  we introduce the idea of an integrated framework for strategic management, 
which also serves as an outline for this book. The framework suggests that strategic 
management is ultimately about finding a balance between the processes of strategy 
formation an d organisational architecture.

In Chapter 2, we explained that the aim of strategic management is to 
ensure that an organisation achieves competitive advantage, and 
sustains its competitive advantage over competitors. Strategic 
management helps organisations to achieve superior performance and 
sustainability over the long term. Although there are many different 
approaches to strategic management, the ultimate aim of any strategic 
management activity is survival and long -term goal achievement in a  
changing environment. However, strategic  management is not only aimed at improving the long -term survival of 
profit -oriented organisations, but it also adds value to non -profit 
organisations, public organisations, governments, sport soci eties and 
schools. In fact, the principles of strategic management are such that it 
can help and guide any organisation, institution and individual towards 
achieving their goals despite changes in the environment.  
The case study describes Capitec's success  in the banking 
industry. The basis of Capitec's success is its commitment to its 
medium - and long -term strategy. The case study also highlights the 
fact that a clear understanding of the needs of the market informed 
Capitec's efforts to offer simplified a nd affordable banking products. 
The Capitec strategies are formulated through a deliberate process to 
evaluate strategic options in terms of the business context in which it 
finds itself, which is the focus if this chapter.  
The process to formulate strateg ies can take many forms and 
involves the entire organisation on various levels. Table 2.1 in Chapter 
2 depicted the levels of strategic decision -making and indicated the 
three levels of strategy (corporate level, business level and functional 
level). For t he most part, all organisations will have strategies on each 
level and the implementation of these strategies cascades throughout. 
Yet, the approach followed is unique to each organisation and there 
may be vast differences between, for example, Capitec's a pproach and 
that of the Absa Banking Group. In addition, the approach followed by 
a small business may be entirely different from the approach followed 
by a large business which has clearly defined business levels and 
business units. What is, however, foun d to be common among the 
different approaches to formulating strategies is the involvement of 
senior management, a focus on the long term and a commitment to 
the entire organisation (and not only a business unit, department or 
section within). It is necess ary to note here that the process of 
formulating strategies entails much more than strategic breakaways 
and glossy integrated reports. It is also entirely possible that some 
organisations have all their strategies written down and documented 
while others h ave a less formal approach. The process of formulating 
strategies leads to actions to implement the strategies and deliberate 
attempts to monitor their progress.  
Strategic management and the processes associated with 
strategising are not new concepts. Stra tegic management has been 
part of every organisation, albeit in a deliberate and formal approach, 
or an emergent adaption to survive in a changing environment. The 
original approaches to strategic management were grounded in 
business policies and planning approaches. Strategic management then 
evolved into a process consisting of definite stages or phases. Later, 
and most recently, strategic management is considered from a practice 
perspective, wherein the impetus is on the 'doing' part.  
54  
This chapter focuses on the process perspective of strategic 
management, which can be described as a formal, rational approach to 
developing deliberate strategies for achieving strategic 
competitiveness and competitive advantage. It is part of strategy 
formation, as illustrated in Figure 3.1, focusing on the content  part of 
strategy formation. The discussions in this chapter will commence with 
an explanation of the process perspective of strategic management, 
followed by an explanation of the new competitiv e realities and 
criticisms of the process perspective. The management levels involved 
in strategic management will then be addressed. Thereafter, each of 
the phases in the process perspective of strategic management will be 
explained with practical example s illustrating these phases.

Case study  
Capitec - no longer just a new kid on the  block  
The four major South African banks, Standard Bank, Absa Bank, FirstRand Bank and Nedbank, 
share about 80 per cent of the market. The remainder of the market belongs to a 
combination of other role -players in the industry. According to the South Afric an Banking 
Sector Overview, the SA banking industry consists of 17 registered banks, two mutual banks, 
14 local branches of foreign banks, two co -operative banks and 43 foreign banks with 
approved local representative offices.1 When one looks at the latest  full-year data from the 
retail banks, the battle to be the biggest is fierce between FirstRand and Standard Bank. 
What is exciting to see is the growth of Capitec. Out of nowhere in 2001, Capitec emerged 
with a dream to provide low -cost financial services  to low -income groups. From a humble 
beginning, Capitec moved in and, 15 years later, celebrated an increase in headline earnings 
of 18 per cent to R3.8 billion for the 2016 financial year. These earnings represented a record 
growth of 1.3 million with 8.6  million active clients.2 During March 2017, Capitec revealed 
that it was adding 120,000 new banking clients each month!3 In terms of the customer base, 
Capitec secured more than 15 per cent of the customers in the South African banking sector.  
What is the  secret to Capitec's success? How did it move from being the new kid on 
the block to becoming a noticeable presence and a real threat to the big four banks in South 
Africa?  
According to the 2016 South African Customer Satisfaction Index (SAcsi) report, 
Capitec outcompeted all the other banks in terms of customer satisfaction - for three years in 
a row.4 Capitec changed the game of banking by offering a simplified and affordable product 
- built on set fees and a single account over the often -complex calculat ions and bundled 
product offerings from competing groups.5 
Capitec is led by its CEO, Gerrie Fourie, who confirms that the bank will continue its 
focus on the fundamentals of delivering simplified banking that is affordable and easy to 
access through perso nal service.  
This resonates with most South Africans and is what sets us apart, especially in 
the current tough economic climate, giving clients a sense of value and allowing 
them to feel in control of their money. Through strong marketing 
communications, a focus on client service and positive word of mouth, the Capitec 
brand has grown in stature, with South Africans from all walks of life accepting 
Capitec as their first choice bank.6 
Overall, Capitec is committed to sustainable profit. This is achieved th rough the right 
strategy, focused leadership, a healthy corporate culture based on strong values and 
responding to stakeholders' needs. Capitec's strategies are built on providing a unique 
service, enhancing the product offering, growing the client numbers , increasing transaction 
income, managing costs of credit to clients, and responsible risk management. These 
strategies are crafted over the short to medium term (one to five years) without losing focus 
on the long term (more than five years). The long -term view is to become

a preferred global retail bank enabled through virtual banking. The foundation of Capitec's 
success includes its competitive culture and its ability to achiev e results through operational 
excellence and teamwork. These are key ingredients in Capitec’s growth and its success in 
executing an innovative strategy.  
LO 1:  Explain  the process  perspective  of strategic  management.  
3.1 A process perspective of strategic management  
The traditional view of strategic management is that it is a process with distinct  
stages or phases. The approach adopted in this book is that strategic management is  
a complex and dynamic discipline and that a static, linear process does not consider  
the complexity or the environment in which the organisation operates (refer to the  
contemporary strategic management framework provided in Chapter 2, Figure 2.4).  
However, an understanding of the process perspective of strategic management is a  
valuable starting point and offers a sound theoretical foundation from which to work.  
The three stages of the process perspective are depicted in Figure 3.2.  
 --------------   
? 
This is the first stage of the strategic management process. This stage is  
a conceptual process that consists of environmental analyses and the  
development of strategies.  
 ___________________________  1 __________________   
Strategic implementation  
This is the second stage of the strategic management process and is referred to as the action 
phase. All staff in the organisation are tasked with imple menting the strategies.  
1 
Strategic control  
This is the third stage of the strategic management process and is also referred to as the 
review or monitoring phase. The strategy review phase is  
aimed at monitoring progress and providing feedback.   ---------------   
Figure 3.2 The process perspective of strategic management  
The strategy planning stage is often also referred to as strategy crafting. The strategy 
implementation stage is also referred to as strategy execution and strategic control is also 
referred to as the strategy review stage or strategy review and control stage.  Strategic 
planning  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
It is important to realise that strategic management is a continuous activity and information 
obtained through the strategic review or control stage feeds back into strategic planning and 
strategy implementation. The following section offers a more detailed explanation of each 
of these stages.  
3.1.1  Strategic planning  
The strategic planning stage is the starting point of the strategic management process. The 
process perspective to strategic management is often also referred to as the traditional 
perspective. Traditionally, it was accepted that the roles between the different levels of 
management were clearly defin ed and that the top managers were the key strategists in the 
organisation, while the middle and lower level of managers were mostly involved in 
implementing the strategies developed by the top management team. Strategic planning, 
according to the process p erspective, is the stage in which the top management team (the 
strategists) decide on the strategic direction of the organisation as a whole. Typically, this 
stage mostly involves senior management who conduct various analyses of the organisation 
itself, a s well as of the environment in which it operates. Part of this phase is the setting of 
strategic direction, in other words, deciding on the future of the organisation and setting the 
overarching goals of the organisation. For example, when looking at the case study about 
Capitec, the founder, Michiel le Roux, had a vision for a low -cost bank for low -income 
customers. The vision formed the centre of the founding, listing and operations of the bank. 
The vision set the strategic planning process in motion. Du ring this stage, the top 
management team devised a vision or dream for such a bank; analysed the environment and 
competitors, and then devised strategies to achieve its dream. The practising strategy box 
below provides comments from Michiel le Roux (founde r) and Gerrie Fourie (current CEO) 
and show how the overarching goal is still guiding Capitec’s activities - 15 years down the 
line. The practising strategy box also includes the company slogan which exclaims that 
Capitec offers simple banking - aligned to  the original vision of offering a simple and low -
cost banking solution.  
Practising strategy: Capitec  
Bruce Whitfield's interview with Capitec founder, Michiel le Roux, 20 July 20167 
Twitter comments:  
'I originally had a very basic bank in mind.’8 
'I told our shareholders we'll either be a big success or a small failure. Not in my 
wildest dreams could I foresee the success we've had.'  
'We'll keep it simple. In 10 years it'll still be recognisable as the bank you see today.'9 
58 CHAPTER 3: A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
Comments from new Capitec CEO, Gerrie Fourie:  
When asked what the future strategy for Capitec will hold, Gerrie Fourie stated 
that 'more of the same, but, my tenure will have an increased focus on what is in 
the client's best interest. ... I need to build on this platform and drive the 
organisation to deliver even more value for each client. This will further 
differentiate us from other banks, offering greater convenience and attracting 
more primary bank clients '.10 
It's banking, just simpler.  
From one banking solution and innovative tech to Sunday and paperless banking, 
everything we do is to make your life easier and empower you to take control of 
your money.1’ 
In addition to a company slogan, a range of management tools can be used to set strategic 
direction, such as a vision statement, a purpose or mission statement, or a statement of 
strategic intent. Some organisations also include a value statement. Looking at Capitec 
again, their slogan can be transl ated into a mission and values statement that provides more 
detail about their product and service offerings, their markets, the technologies they use to 
make banking simpler, and their commitment to their stakeholders.  
During the strategic planning stage,  various analyses take place and the senior 
managers gather information about the operations, resources and capabilities of the 
organisation. The senior management team also scans the environment to identify potential 
opportunities and threats, as well as evaluating the market or industry in which the 
organisation operates and collecting information on competitors. This is referred to as an 
external environmental analysis. The senior management team also scans the internal 
environment, in other words, the o rganisation itself, with the purpose of identifying its 
own strengths and weaknesses. Once all the information from the external and internal 
environments has been collected and analysed, the senior management team then considers 
the various strategic opti ons and chooses those strategies where the fit between what the 
organisation can do with the opportunities is the strongest. In addition, the senior 
management team formulates the strategic goals for the organisation. For example, 
FlySafair entered the low -cost airline industry with a vision to open the skies to many who 
had never flown before.12 Their strategy is premised on their commitment to make prices 
sustainable and to keep them low. FlySafair aims to keep costs per seat as low as possible. 
Part of i ts actions included changing the seats on its aircraft to make it lighter and thinner, 
thereby reducing fuel costs .]i Linked to its mission to provide low -fare, hassle -free and on -
time travel experiences, one of FlySafair’s strategic goals may, for example , be that 
FlySafair will achieve a 95 per cent on -time performance while offering seats at 5 per cent 
less than competitors will. This deliberate decision to focus on low -cost air travel is a 
result of an external environmental analysis that identified the  opportunities in these 
markets.  
59 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
An analysis of the organisation’s internal environment identified various strengths of the 
organisation that enable them to make use of the opportunities identified in the external 
environmental analysis. Once the strategies to take the organisation towards the 
achievement of its objectives have been selected, the next stage of the strategic 
management process starts, namely strategy implementation.  
3.1.2  Strateg y implementation  
The second stage of the strategic management process is referred to as the strategy 
implementation stage and is considered the most challenging stage in any strategic 
management process. As we explained earlier, the process perspective to strategic 
management offers a traditional approach in which the top management team, or senior 
management team, was responsible for the strategy formation and the middle and lower -
level managers were seen as the implementers of the strategies devised by th e senior 
managers.  
Once the senior management team has selected the strategies of the organisation, 
they need to be put into action. This requires the involvement of everyone in the 
organisation. The corporate strategies, and the senior management team’s r ationale for 
selecting them, need to be communicated to all parties. Not only should the organisation 
members be told what the strategies and overarching objectives of the organisation are, but 
the senior management team also need to ensure that there is u nderstanding and buy -in 
because the wider the organisational support, the greater the chances of successful 
implementation. Members must be motivated and energised towards achieving these goals 
on business, functional levels and even individual levels.  
Operationalising strategies are an important aspect of strategy implementation. They 
entail translating the overarching and strategic objectives into specific programmes, 
projects, tasks and activities. The middle and lower management levels in the organisati on 
are responsible for this, as well as for overseeing it, so they must be empowered to do so. 
By translating the strategic goals or long -term objectives into shorter term goals and 
activities, the organisation members becomc aware of their roles in the st rategic success of 
the organisation (refer to Figure 1.1 in Chapter 1 that depicts the hierarchy of 
organisational plans).  
At its most basic level, strategy implementation is the action (‘doing’) stage of the 
process perspective of strategic management. Ac tions to successfully implement strategies 
are ensured through certain drivers such as leadership, management, and culture. 
Organisational culture is commonly referred to as ‘the way we do things around here’ and 
how things are done will impact on success.  For example, if the organisational culture is 
negative and there is little support for the strategies, then the strategy implementation 
process becomes more challenging and can actually fail. But when the organisational 
culture is positive and there is wi de buy -in, the efforts to implement the strategies are more 
co-ordinated and have a greater chance of success. Organisational culture and strategy are 
discussed in detail in Chapter 11.  
60 CHAPTER 3: A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
The middle and lower levels of managers can use rewards to drive strategy implementation. 
By rewarding the actions, tasks and behaviour that contribute towards successful 
implementation of strategies, managers enhance the chances of strategy suc cess. Managers 
should thus devise reward strategies and systems that are aligned to the overall strategic 
direction of the organisation.  
The way that the organisation is structured also impacts on the strategy 
implementation process. If the strategy requir es quick decision -making, then a bureaucratic 
structure that entails time -consuming red tape may hamper efforts. The organisational 
structure not only indicates the lines of authority and reporting, but also the process and 
lines for strategy implementatio n. Coupled with the structure of the organisation are the 
inherent systems and policies inside the organisation. Organisational systems, processes 
and policies are used to direct the execution efforts. Again, the systems, processes and 
policies should be a ligned with the overall strategic direction of the organisation.  
Finally, leaders and managers in the organisation need to empower and enable the 
employees and organisation members to carry out the tasks to implement the strategies. 
This requires the appro priate allocation of financial, human, physical and informational 
resources. If the resources are lacking, the implementation efforts will surely fail.  
Although monitoring the implementation of the strategies takes place continuously, 
in terms of the proce ss perspective on strategic management, it is regarded as the third 
stage.  
3.1.3  Strategy review and control  
Strategy review and control involves monitoring the progress of strategy implementation, 
measuring actual or realised performance, comparing actual performance with planned 
performance, identifying problems and instituting any necessary corrective actions. 
Although described as the third and final stage in the strategic management process, it is a 
continuous process. As strategies are implemented, the  strategy review takes place.  
Different methods of strategy review exist. One such method is continuous 
environmental scanning, which can be considered a review method as it provides feedback 
on changes in the environment that may impact on strategic choic es and their execution. 
Another form of strategy review is implementation control. Similar to operational control, 
this is where deviations from the plans are identified and addressed as they occur. This 
implies that corrective measures are taken during th e strategy implementation process to 
ensure that the strategic management process continues successfully.  
It is mostly senior and middle managers who are involved in the strategy review 
process. Most important is the feedback from the review that needs to serve a<> input in the 
amendment of existing strategies and goals, or the possible total reconsideration of the 
strategies and goals. Continuous feedback forms the foundation of the strategic 
management process.  
61 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
LO 2:  Criticise  the process  perspective  of strategic  management.  
3.2 The new competitive realities - criticising the 
process perspective of strategic management  
The biggest critique of the process perspective of strategic management is  that, in being a 
linear process, the complexity of the environment is not considered and dealt with 
sufficiently. Also, the process perspective supports the notion that it is mainly the top 
management team or senior managers who craft or formulate strateg ies while other levels 
of management merely implement those strategies.  
In practice, strategic management is much more complex and dynamic than is 
portrayed in the process perspective. Strategy is not something that an organisation has, but 
is rather somet hing that an organisation, and the people in the organisation, does.  The 
reality of strategic management in the contemporary business environment is that it is a 
messy and complex process, influenced by many different aspects. Strategy, in reality, is 
crafted through a process of conversation and input from all levels in the organisation and 
inputs from various stakeholders (as discussed in Chapter 1, Section 1.7).  
In Chapter 4, we take a closer look at who does strategy in organisations.  
LO 3:  Identify and  explain the various management levels involved in strategic  
management.  
3.3 The management levels involved in strategic 
management  
In a medium to large -sized organisation, there are usually three levels of management, 
namely top management, middle management and lower -level management. Top 
management comprises the CEO, the board of directors and senior managers. As described 
above, the top management team (or senior management team) will play a major role in 
setting the organisation’s strategic direction and i n analysing the environment. The 
information they gather will then be used to formulate the strategies.  
It is mostly the middle and lower -level managers who are responsible for the 
execution of the strategies through the managing of employees. The top mana gers rely on 
the middle managers to ensure that their planned strategies are implemented. Top 
management then becomes more involved once again during the strategy review process. 
Chapter 4 offers a more detailed discussion of strategists.  
62 CHAPTER 3: A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
LO 4:  Explain  strategic  planning  and recognise the strategic direction and  
environmental analysis in organisations.  
The following section discusses in more detail the process of st rategic planning. The 
practising strategy box offers some background on Katlego Global Logistics and includes 
the vision and mission statement to serve as an example.  
Katlego Global Logistics (Pty) Ltd was founded in 1998 by Moses Maboi and borne out 
of his drive and enthusiasm for attaining efficient and dependable service in the freight 
logistics industry. From the onset, Moses was motivated by his passion for his country 
and his dream to contribute to South Africa's economic potential by partnering wit h 
stakeholders to contribute to the development and value add for black -owned and -
managed companies. Given his years of experience in the industry, Moses set out, not 
only to render quality and professional services in all freight - and trade -related 
servi ces, but also to the develop skills of employees through training and exposure.  
Katlego Global Logistics offers solutions in the areas of clearing and forwarding, 
air freighting and car -going, supply chain and inventory management, logistics, 
customs broki ng and project shipments.  
Katlego Global Logistics adds the value of time and place utility as it offers 
integrated services and tailored, customer -focused solutions for managing and 
transporting documents, goods and information. This involves the integrat ion of 
information, transportation, inventory, warehousing, material handling and packaging, 
and occasionally, security.  
The company has become recognised as a freight and courier industry expert, 
supply -chain innovator and a business partner. It does not use contractors within the 
boundaries of South Africa, assuring customers that it is tracking and keeping their 
precious cargo safe. With a dedicated national fleet of vehicles ranging from small, 
utility one -ton vans to larger eight -ton trucks, Katlego Gl obal Logistics is well 
represented nationally.  
The vision of Katlego Global Logistics is to be the preferred supplier in the 
freight logistics industry known for excellent service delivery. Their mission is:  
To lead with insight and innovation, constantly strengthening the company's

63 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
3.4.1  The strategic direction of the organisation  
The organisation’s management and employees need to know the reasons for the 
organisation’s existence. The strategic direction clarifies the overarching purpose and goals 
of the organisation, as well as indicating to external stakeholders what the organisation is 
about. Seve ral management tools are used to set the strategic direction. As an example, the 
practising strategy box on Katlego Global Logistics provides its vision and mission 
statements that offer a clear message on its purpose. The following section explains how 
the vision statement, the mission statement and the strategic goals are used to direct the 
actions and strategic efforts of the organisation over the long term.  
Not only does the strategic direction provide the organisation and its members with 
a primary direction, but it also helps bind the organisation members as a cohesive unit. 
Figure 3.3 depicts the benefit of strategic direction. The diagram below indicates the 
multiple different directions in which the organisation and its members are working. The 
other one shows how the overall stated strategic direction (represented by the blue arrow) 
aligns the efforts of the entire organisation and its members in one direction.  
 
Having sound strategic direction is a powerful contributor to strategic success as it forms 
the starting point for a carefully planned and implemented strategy. It also provides focus 
and directs all actions towards ac hieving the same goal.  
Some organisations do not have separate vision and mission statements, while others 
have only mission statements. Organisations are diverse and varied, just like the people 
who work in them, and this creates room for a range of diffe rent practices. The strategic 
direction can be expressed through a vision, a mission or both. What is crucial is that the 
entire organisation and its members know where they are going and what they are working 
towards.  
Table 3.1 offers a summary of the adv antages of having clear strategic direction, 
expressed through the vision and mission statements of organisations.  
64  
CHAPTER 3: A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
Table 3.1 Advantages of having clear strategic direction  
1. It provides direction and a clear indication of what the organisation  is aiming for.  
2. It ensures that all the organisational efforts and all the organisation  members are  
working towards the same goals.  
3. It offers a clear message to internal and external stakeholders on what the 
organisation wants to achieve over the long term.  
4. It guides problem -solving and decision -making as the end goal is clear to all.  
5. It provides the organisation with a unique identity.  
6. It contributes to synergy among all managers and other employees and stakeholders.  
The vision statement  
The vision statement is often referred to as the dream of the organisation. It is used as an 
indicator of the desired future position of the organisation. It is often not realistic in literal 
terms. Fo r example, the vision of Katlego Global Logistics (see the practising strategy box 
provided earlier) is to be ‘the preferred supplier in the freight logistics industry known for 
excellent service delivery’. This may seem overly ambitious, but it is a power ful statement 
designed to motivate the entire organisation. Another example is that of the freight 
division of Grindrod Limited. Their vision is ‘to be a dominant and profitable freight 
services provider focusing on infrastructural development on the Afric an continent’. The 
delineation of ‘African continent’ clarifies their playing field. A good vision statement 
should identify the direction and future of the organisation. As the entire organisation and 
its members need to work towards reaching this future destination, it should be persuasive 
and credible, and easily understood.  
There is no standard format for a vision statement. Some organisations may opt for 
short and punchy vision statements, while others may opt for more descriptive versions. 
However, there are certain guidelines for what a vision statement should be, namely:  
¦ It should present a clear picture of a desirable future, something to which the 
organisation and its stakeholders can aspire.  
¦ It should guide decision -making, yet be flexible enoug h to allow the organisation 
to respond to changes in the environment.  
¦ It should be easy to communicate, to explain and to understand.  
Ultimately, the vision is not just a statement on a piece of paper, but rather galvanises and 
directs people in the organisation.  
The mission statement  
The mission statement is also called the purpose statement of the organisation. In its most 
simplistic form, the mission statement provides an indication of what the organisation does 
and why it exists. The mission state ment builds on the vision  
65 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
statement. The mission statement is not only used internally within the organisation, but 
often used in external communication and the media. The mission is as much an internal 
statement as it is an external statement. The three core components of a missio n statement 
are product and/or service, market  and technology:  
¦ The product and/or service: A mission statement should indicate the product or 
service that the organisation offers and should answer the question ‘what are our 
primary products and/or services  that we offer?’  
¦ The market: A mission statement should indicate the market that it hopes to serve 
and should answer the question ‘who is our primary target market?’  
¦ Technology: Lastly, a mission statement should indicate the method (technology) 
used to de liver this product or service to the market and should answer the 
question ‘what technology will be used to provide the products and services to 
our market/s?’  
In addition, a well -formulated mission statement could also contain the following:  
¦ Often organisations give an indication of their commitment to stakeholders by 
including how important their customers are, or how the organisation invests in 
its employees or builds relationships with business partners (see Chapter 1 for an 
explanation of stakeh olders). A good example is City Lodge Hotels:15 
We will be recognised as the preferred Southern African hotel group. 
Through dedicated leadership, teamwork and kindness, we will 
demonstrate our consistent commitment to delivering caring service with 
style and grace.  We will constantly enhance our guest experience through 
our passionate people, ongoing innovation and leading -edge technology. 
Our integrity ; values and ongoing investment in our people and hotels 
will provide exceptional returns to stakeholders  and ensure continued, 
sustainable growth. Through acts of kindness,  we will make a positive 
difference to our guests, our colleagues, our communities and our 
environment.  
¦ The organisation’s orientation towards survival and growth is often expressed 
throug h stating their commitment to economic objectives. For example, 
ADvTECH, a placement, private education and training provider listed on the 
JSE, specifically refers to their aim to build, grow and achieve:  
We aim to BUILD and grow a high -quality organisati on in education, 
training and placement that is widely recognised for passionate 
commitment and success in enriching people's lives and future.  We aim to 
GROW a reputation for our ability to make a real difference to the people 
we serve, for our connectedn ess and partnerships with African and global 
markets and players, for the relevance, quality and usefulness of our 
offerings, and for the enterprising and agile way in which we tackle our 
task. We will ACHIEVE this by focusing on  
66 CHAPT ER 3: A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
our customers and taking a lead from our markets, by our innovative 
approach, especially in harnessing the power of technology, and by 
striving for excellence and sustainability in all we do.'6 
¦ Organisational values are principles that the organisation stands by; these values 
are held in high regard within the organisation and sets the standard of how the 
organisation wants to do business. An example of a mission statement that 
includes the organ isation’s values is Virgin Money, a financial services brand 
that entered the South African market with an aim of simplifying banking:  
Our mission is to give you: 1. A great deal, 2. Straightforward financial 
products, 3. Brilliant service.17 
¦ The organisat ional philosophy offers an indication of how the organisation plans 
to do business. The organisational philosophy is often linked to ethical 
standards; for example, Premier Hotels and Resorts, a hospitality service 
provider with hotels and resorts in South  Africa has the following philosophy:  
l/Ve are a professional, passionate, caring and empowering company that 
encourages innovation and engagement.  We are a learning organisation 
committed to the retention and development of our people as an essential 
part of building strong, respectful and enduring guest relationships. Our 
staff are motivated, friendly and obsessive about enhancing the guest 
experience through meeting and  exceeding expectations for quality 
service.'8 
The value of setting clear strategic direction, whether through a vision or mission 
statement or both, is an important contributor to organisational success.  
The process of formulating a mission statement  
Strategic direction is long term and ought to remain unchanged for an extended period. 
Organisations that change their strategic direction on an annual basis send a message that 
they are not sure where they are going. As the vision and mission statements are an 
expression of the strategic direction, these should also remain largely unchanged except, 
perhaps, for minor amendments to the wording.  
Although there is no one agreed method for drafting a mission statement, most agree 
that it should involve as many people as possible because this contributes towards 
acceptance. External consultants ma y also be called in, but it is very important that the 
strategic direction be created internally.  
One way to craft a mission statement is as follows:  
¦ Orient those involved as to what constitutes a well -formulated mission statement.  
¦ Do a brainstorming exercise to generate as many creative ideas as possible.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
¦ Collate all the draft ideas and distribute them for comment.  
¦ Continue this process until there is agreement on what the mission should be.  
In the case of a start -up business, it is easier for a management team to compile the 
strategic direction. For established and multi -business organisations, however, the 
management team will need to maintain the business operations while the pro cess to amend 
or redesign the strategic direction is underway.  
Strategic goals  
Flowing directly from the mission statement is the need to translate the overarching 
direction of the organisation into strategic goals. The strategic goals have a shorter time 
frame than the vision and mission statements (five to ten years as a rule of thumb) because 
they are determined by the nature and the level of complexity and rate of change in an 
organisation and within its industry.  
To be of value, strategic goals need to  be measurable in terms of time, money and units. 
Table 3.2 compares well -formulated and poorly formulated strategic goals.  
Table 3.2 A comparison of well and poorly formulated strategic goals  
Poorly formulated strategic goals  Well -formulated strategic goals  
Our goal is to increase our market 
share.  Our goal is to increase our market share by 3°/o by 
the end of 2021.  
The goal for 2021 is to expand our 
product range.  The goal for 2021 is to expand our product range by 
introducing two new products in the  baby clothing 
division.  
By 2023, we will open new stores.  By 2023, we will open one new store in Mahikeng, in 
the North West Province and one new store in 
Kimberley, Northern Cape.  
The SMART principles can be used to formulate good strategic goals:  
S - specific M - 
measurable A - 
achievable R - 
realistic T - 
time  
Goals should be specific and measurable so that people know exactly what it is that will be 
expected of them. Goals must be considered attainable by those who need to work towards 
achieving them  (if, on the one hand, they seem impossible to reach, people will see no point 
in even trying or will quickly become discouraged).  CHAPTER 3: A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
The goals should be realistic, yet aimed at a level that will motivate people (on the other 
hand, if they are too easy to reach, people will not be inspired to work harder). Finally, a 
well -formulated goal is linked to a specific time period so people have a deadline to work 
towards (an open -ended goa l will carry no sense of urgency and could take years to 
complete).  
Over and above meeting the SMART principles, strategic goals should also be 
congruent with the mission statement components, the overall strategic direction of the 
organisation and should focus on the key performance areas of the organisation (the next 
section will focus on the use of the balanced scorecard to identify these areas). Also, goals 
should be acceptable - people tend to pursue goals that are consistent with their preferences 
and perceptions. Lastly, strategic goals should be flexible. Organisations function in a 
turbulent business environment, which makes it necessary to allow for goals to be modified 
due to changing circumstances.  
Using the balanced scorecard to set strategic go als 
The balanced scorecard (BSC) is a strategic management tool that was developed by Kaplan 
and Norton.19 When used in the strategic planning stage, it guides the organisation and 
management team to translate the strategic direction into strategic goals. One of the 
benefits of the BSC is that it offers a balanced approach to setting strategic goals. The 
‘balance’ is grounded in its four perspectives: financial, customer, learning and growth, 
and business processes. At the centre of these, is the strategic direction, which will include 
the vision, mission and other statements.  
For each perspective of the BSC, strategic goals need to be formulated that will 
contribute to the achievement of the strategic direction. Each perspective offers a view on 
what needs to be done with a focus on two internal measures (internal business processes 
and learning and growth) and two external measures (customers and finance). The balance 
between the internal and external perspectives ensure that the strategic goals are aligned  
with the strategic direction. The four perspectives of the BSC are explained below:  
¦ The financial perspective, with a focus on the financial performance of the 
organisation. The financial perspective is linked to the expectations and needs of 
the shareholders, as well as to the financial performance or stewardship of the 
organisation.  
¦ The customer perspective, with a focus on how the organisation’s customers 
perceive it. The customer perspective works towards a focus on satisfying 
customer needs an d a consideration of how customers see the organisation.  
¦ The learning and growth perspective, with a focus on sustainable growth, value 
creation and innovation. This perspective is also called organisational capacity 
and is aimed at the employees (human ca pital) and the capacity to achieve its 
goals.  
¦ The business process perspective, with a focus on the core capabilities at which 
the organisation must excel in order to be competitive. This perspective is linked 
to quality and efficiency in all that the orga nisation does.  
69 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Each of these four perspectives is linked to a specific question which guides the setting of 
the strategic goals. Given the foci of each of these perspectives, the BSC is a  handy tool 
that is used to translate the strategic direction into goals and targets. These targets can be 
seen as the shorter term aims at the business level, which guides the activities or actions 
needed on the functional level. Figure 3.4 provides guidi ng questions for each perspective. 
These four questions are used to select the most important strategic goals on corporate 
level (refer to Table 2.1 in Chapter 2, where a distinction was made between the various 
levels of strategy). A successful applicatio n of the BSC may include two to five goals in 
each perspective and each goal should be joined by a performance target that indicates 
whether the goal is achieved, as part of the review process.

The scorecard is balanced in that it includes strategic goals and measures for all four 
perspectives. The purpose is to ‘balance’ the strategic goals by ensuring that one business 
area (such as finance) does not dominate the strategic direction of the organisation, whil e, 
at the same time, ensuring a focus on a few key metrics that could serve as a ‘scorecard’ 
for the whole organisation.

The following practising strategy box uses CellMobile as an example of the application of 
the BSC.  
Practising strategy: An example of the 
application of the balanced scorecard  
CellMobile is a (fictitious) organisation in the South African cellular telephone in dustry. 
Their vision is to be the preferred supplier of pre -paid cellular services. Their growth 
strategy is aimed at developing their market by targeting customers in rural areas where 
other cellular services are unreliable and often interrupted.  
If CellMobile uses the balanced scorecard, their starting point will be the vision 
and strategy which is aimed at growth. In each of the perspectives, they will set 
objectives, measures, targets and initiatives that contribute to being the preferred 
supplier and growing their market. For example, in terms of the customer perspective, a 
goal might be to increase the retention of existing customers by 5 per cent per annum 
for the next three years. The targets to be achieved, then, would be 'five per cent 
retenti on' and ‘within a three -year period'. The initiatives to achieve this could now be 
devised, such as improving customer service by enhancing the CellMobile website 
services, or by making pre -paid vouchers more readily available. In terms of the business 
process perspective, CellMobile could set a goal to expand the cellular phone towers to 
ensure better service delivery and thereby be in a position to recruit more customers 
and thus grow their business. The goal could be to expand by two new towers every 
three months over the next two years. For this goal, the targets would be 'two towers', 
'every three months' and ‘over the next two years', and the initiatives could then be 
formulated.  
71 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
The diagram below depicts the customer perspective within CellMobile.  
 
The balanced scorecard offers a valuable framework for setting strategic goals.  
Once the strategic goals have been formulated, the strategy selection process starts. This is 
discussed in Chapter 7. In Sections 3.5 and 3.6, we provided a brief overview of the 
strategy implementation and strategy review processes.  
3.4.2  The role of environmental analysis in the strategic 
management process  
Continuous scanning of the external and internal environments of an organisation supports 
the strategic management process. The purpose of scanning the external environment is to 
identify o pportunities that may be exploited, or threats that may prevent the organisation 
from attaining its strategic objectives.  
Internal analysis is done for the purpose of understanding the organisation’s key 
strengths and key weaknesses, so that it can build o n key strengths and counter or mitigate 
key weaknesses. The role of resources and capabilities is discussed in Chapter 6.  
While many organisations do environmental scanning periodically (for example, at 
an annual strategic planning workshop) it should real ly be an ongoing process that forms 
part of strategic evaluation and control (see Chapter 14).  
72 CHAPTER 3: A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
LO 5:  Explain  strategy  implementation  and recognise  strategic  programmes,  
projects,  the various drivers of strategy implementation and the 
operationalising of strategy in organisations.  
3.5 Strategy implementation  
The purpose of strategy implementation is to align the internal and external environments 
with the chosen strategy. Strategy impl ementation is often seen as the most challenging 
stage in the strategic management process. Scholars such as Jooste and Fourie,21 Candido 
and Santos,22 and Speculand23 documented some of the challenges linked to strategy 
implementation. In addition to the recognition in the scholarly community, examples of 
strategy implementation failures often reach news headlines. Numerous studies have been 
conducted on strategy implementation and there is agreement amongst scholars and 
practitioners that strategy impleme ntation is challenging, and it is where most strategy 
initiatives fail.  
3.5.1  Strategic programmes and projects  
Figure 1.1 in Chapter 1, depicts the hierarchy of organisational plans, which indicates that 
strategic plans and initiatives should be managed as spec ial programmes and projects with a 
view to eventually becoming part of the day -to-day operations of the organisation.  
3.5.2  Key drivers for implementing strategy  
Once a strategy has been selected, it needs to be communicated to the entire organisation 
and those who are tasked with implementing it, need to know exactly what is required. 
Effective leadership and management are vital to the success of any strategy. The managers 
and leaders in the organisation are responsible, not only for communicating the strategy,  
but also for guiding the actions required to execute it. Simply informing staff and other 
stakeholders is not enough. A general understanding of the rationale behind the strategy 
and the alleviation of any uncertainties are both vital to ensure agreement and support 
among all who are responsible for strategy implementation.  
Strategy execution and renewal is a continuous process with specific targets to be 
reached at specific points in time, and organisational management and leadership are 
responsible for k eeping employees motivated. Because change goes hand -in-hand with 
uncertainty and resistance, leaders will need to help members come to terms with the 
change and empower them to guide others to do the same. Behaviour, actions and tactics 
will need to be ad apted. Involving people in the change process and ensuring that they 
understand the reasons for the change will ease the transition. There should be a fine 
balance between driving the change and giving people time to adjust.  
Strategy implementation deals w ith the ‘doing’ part of the strategy, and 
organisational culture plays an important role in the success or failure of an organisation. 
An unhealthy and negative culture can cause undue resistance to change which  
73 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
seriously hampers progress. This is something management and leadership will have to 
tackle as it can undermine the entire strategic management process. Organisational culture 
can help or hinder the strategy execution process. Chapters 11 and 12 deal with 
organisational culture and the role of strategic leaders respectively in more detail.  
Resource allocation is another important driver of strategy implementation. 
Resources comprise human resources, physical resources, informati on resources and time. 
Coupled with the allocation of resources, is the need for structure. Organisational structure 
indicates the lines of authority and responsibilities in the organisation. It forms the 
backbone of the organisation and helps to direct th e various actions required to implement 
the strategies. The organisational structure needs to support the implementation of the 
strategies. A more detailed discussion of organisational structure is included in Chapter 13.  
Finally, the last driver of strate gy implementation is organisational learning, which 
is covered in Chapter 9. Organisational learning is a process in response to change and 
provides for change, creating new knowledge and practices and, ultimately, the transferring 
of knowledge.  
3.5.3  Operationa lising strategy  
Below is a brief explanation of the functional tactics (ie short -term goals) to explain how 
strategy is translated into operationalised actions. We remind you of Table 2.1 in Chapter 2 
where the levels of strategic decision -making are descr ibed. This section deals with 
operationalising strategic goals on the business and functional levels.  
It is important that the entire workforce knows, not only the overall direction of the 
organisation, but also what needs to be done on a daily, weekly and  monthly basis in order 
to achieve the strategic goals. The middle management cadre will take the lead in this 
process by translating the strategic goals into specific, measurable, achievable, realistic 
goals to be achieved within a year or less. Although the strategic goals are specific and 
measurable, their focus is on the long term. In order to ensure that these strategic goals are 
operationalised, they need to be translated and adapted for the medium term. The same 
criteria required for setting strategi c goals is important here. When the middle managers 
(such as the section heads, departmental leaders and site managers) involve the supervisory 
level in this process, the acceptance of these medium -term goals is ensured. Medium -term 
goals are typically set  for the functional areas in the organisation, such as the marketing, 
operations, human resources, finance and purchasing departments. The balanced scorecard 
also assists in this process. As we have explained earlier, the balanced scorecard has four 
perspe ctives and the organisation’s vision and strategy form the starting point. Within each 
perspective, the balanced scorecard is used to specify the goals, measures, targets and 
initiatives. Each business unit and department in the organisation will have its own focused 
and specifically balanced scorecard.  
In addition to the medium -term goals, functional tactics also need to be developed. 
Functional tactics provide even more detail to ensure the daily operationalisation of the 
organisation’s strategies. A func tional tactic is developed in support of the short -term 
goals. Functional tactics are even more specific and  
74 CHAPTER 3: A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT  
require wider participation. The focus of the functional tactics is the tasks and activities 
required to operationalise the strategy and indicate what needs to be done immediately and 
on a daily basis.  
Finally, the organisational actions to operationalise the strategy are guided by the 
organisational policies. Policies are  often referred to as ‘red tape’ but form an important 
part of the fair and justified actions of the organisation and its workers. Policies provide 
detailed and specific guidelines and rules that direct the organisational activities - the 
framework and spe cific ‘do’s and don’ts’. Policies are often referred to as standard 
operating procedures. It is important that the organisational policies be documented and 
recorded in written format and made available to all the organisational members. In line 
with fair business practices, the policies should also be made available to the customers 
and other stakeholders. Policies guide the organisational managers in the control and co -
ordination of organisational activities.  
L06: Explain  strategy  review and control and identify the main strategic control  
mechanisms in organisations.  
3.6 Strategy review and control  
This chapter started with an explanation of the strategic management process. We indicated 
earlier that the process begins with the development of the organisation's strategies, 
followed by their implementation. The third phase is the review and control phase. In this 
phase, the management uses a range of different measures and processes to check on the 
progress of the implementation process and monitors  the need for changes to some of the 
previously developed strategies and goals. As organisations operate in changing 
environments, the need for regular and continuous monitoring and review is important. 
Different methods to review the strategy implementati on process exist and although the 
focus of each methodology is different, the aims remain the same: review and control.  
Our focus is on the four main strategic control mechanisms, namely, premise 
control, strategic surveillance, special alert control and i mplementation/execution control. 
Typically, all four of these methodologies will be employed, but at different stages of the 
implementation process. When the strategies are devised, a number of assumptions or 
premises are made. Premise control is aimed at reviewing these assumptions in a focused 
way. If any of the assumptions are no longer valid, a change in the strategy is required. 
This type of control is very specific. With its exclusive focus, it is possible that other 
factors, that may also bear an imp act on the success of the strategy, are overlooked. Hence 
the need for the strategic surveillance type of control.  
Strategic surveillance is also referred to as environmental scanning and is not 
focused, but rather opens the opportunity for managers to con sider a whole range of 
¦nternal and external environmental factors. As organisations operate in a changing  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
environment, some changes may occur that were not predicted. Despite the proactive nature 
of the strategic management process, it is impossible to predict and plan for all changes, 
especially unexpected changes that lead to a total reconsideration of the strategies. This 
type of control is often referred to as implementation control or e xecution control. It takes 
place during the strategy execution process and comprises four steps: setting the standard, 
measuring the actual, identifying deviations and taking corrective measures. The functional 
managers are responsible for this type of con trol, with inputs from the supervisory level. 
Special alert control is linked to a largely unpredicted and unexpected event that warrants a 
total review of the strategy. Chapter 14 provides a detailed discussion of the different types 
of strategic review a nd control methodologies.  
The big picture  
The process perspective of strategic management advocates that strategic management 
comprise three stages, namely, strategic planning, strategy implementation and strategy 
review and control. The process perspectiv e supports a linear approach to managing 
organisations strategically and is also referred to as the traditional approach. Yet, as 
organisations and management thinking evolve, new perspectives and approaches to 
strategic management have emerged. These pers pectives do not replace the traditional 
perspective, but rather open opportunities for managing organisations in new competitive 
realities.  
The focus of this chapter was to introduce different perspectives and to provide 
specific details on the process per spective of strategic management.  
Summary of learning outcomes  
L01: Explain the process perspective of strategic management.  
The process perspective is a traditional approach to strategic management that follows a 
mostly linear process that is driven by the top management team and divided into three 
distinct stages or phases.  
LO 2: Criticise the process perspective of strategic management.  
The process perspective is a linear process that does not consider the complexity or the 
environment in which the org anisation operates. The process perspective also sees strategy 
as a top -down function - with strategic decisions made by top management and middle 
managers tasked with implementing it.  CHAPTER 3: A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE OF STRATEGIC MANAGEM ENT 
LO 3: Identify and explain the management levels involved in strategic 
management.  
The different management levels involved in strategic management fall within three main 
categories: top management, middle management and lower -level management. For the  
most part, top management is responsible for setting the strategic direction and middle and 
lower -level managers are responsible for the execution of the strategies.  
LO 4: Explain strategy strategic planning and recognise the strategic direction 
and envir onmental analysis in organisations.  
With the process perspective of strategic management, the first stage is strategic planning 
that starts with the setting of the strategic direction. By having strategic direction, 
organisations and its members form a coh esive unit. Strategic direction is expressed 
through a vision and mission statement. Organisations operate as open systems in changing 
environments which require environmental analysis. Environmental analysis includes and 
analysis of both the internal and the external environment. The purpose of scanning the 
external environment is to identify opportunities that may be exploited, or threats that may 
prevent the organisation from attaining its strategic objectives. Internal analysis is done for 
the purpose o f understanding the organisation’s key strengths and key weaknesses, so that 
it can build on key strengths and counter or mitigate key weaknesses.  
LO 5: Explain strategy implementation and recognise strategic 
programmes, projects, the various drivers of st rategy 
implementation and the operationalising of strategy in 
organisations.  
The purpose of strategy implementation is to align the internal and external environments 
with the chosen strategy. Strategy implementation is often seen as the most challenging 
stage in the strategic management process. A number of drivers exist for strategy 
implementation. These include leadership, organisational culture, resource allocation, 
organisational structure and organisational learning.  
LO 6: Explain strategy review and  control and identify the main strategic 
control mechanisms in organisations.  
Strategy review and control develop during this stage of the strategic management process. 
In this phase, the management uses a range of different measures and processes to check  on 
the progress of the implementation process and monitors the need for changes to some of 
the previously developed strategies and goals. The four main strategic control mechanisms 
are premise control, strategic surveillance, special alert control and 
implementation/execution control.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT

Chapter 3 explained the process perspective of strategic management. 
It also described the three stages in the strategic management 
process. In this chapter, we focus on strategising - the actions of 
strategists that influence the strategy of the organisation in much less 
formal, structured and interactive ways. It is important to note that 
organisations typically have (and should have) a formal strategic 
management process and our argument here is not that these 
processes are wrong. However, organisations should realise that 
strategic management is influenced by much more than just their 
formal processes. They should find ways of tapping into the more 
informal strategising activities within the organisation and using it to 
their advantage. The chapter will also discuss the str ategic actors 
commonly found in organisations, and how they shape strategy (the 
strategists).   
The case study describes Aspen Holdings' history and strategy that was 
formulated by the CEO, Stephen Saad and his team of managers.  The 
opening case also describes Aspen’s deliberate strategy to invest in 
capital projects, as well as their emergent strategy to enter the 
Australian market. This case proves that formulating strategies can be 
deliberate or emergent. In other words, organ isations can have formal 
processes in which they think about and decide what their strategy 
should be (deliberate strategy), while in other instances, the actions of 
strategists will lead to strategies emerging from the pattern of 
decisions (emergent strat egy). The purpose of Chapter 4 is to describe 
the people involved in strategy formulation, implementation and 
review. In short, this chapter will look at who the strategists are and 
how they strategise - specifically, the roles and responsibilities of the 
various strategists. There is a range of actors that participate and 
influence the strategic activities in the organisation. The traditional 
approach to strategic management assigned specific roles to specific 
actors, but more contemporary approaches indic ate that the roles are 
not as clear cut as traditionally proclaimed. For this chapter, we start 
off with a differentiation between a process and practice perspective of 
strategic management, followed by an explanation of the term 
'strategising'. Then, we w ill differentiate between deliberate and 
emergent strategising. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the 
various roles and responsibilities of strategists. Finally, the chapter 
offers concluding comments on the activity of strategising and who 
does i t.

Case study  
Aspen - Strategising over 160 years  
The organisation known today as Aspen Pharmacare has a rich history that stretches over 
160 years. Berry Grey Lennon, a chemist from Ireland, settled in the Cape, South Africa, and 
opened a chemist and druggist in Port Elizabeth in 1850. Not only did he establish a 
household brand, but he also served as chief strategist to grow a company that has proven 
its ability to survive and thrive in a changing bu siness environment. By 1858, Lennon 
advertised his products in the local press and they featured on the cover page of the first 
issue of the South African Medical Journal in 1884. From here on, the wholesale chemist 
expanded and incorporated as a public co mpany in 1898 under the name Lennon Ltd. Today 
this is the Aspen Pharmacare Trading Company and continues to carry the 1898 registration 
number. By 1911, Lennon Ltd had 21 pharmacies across South Africa. During the years that 
followed, Lennon Ltd continued  to grow and by 1930, it had established itself as the largest 
pharmaceutical company in the southern hemisphere. In 1968, the South African Druggist 
group, which included Lennon Ltd, listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. During the 
1970s, Lennon Ltd capitalised on the birth of the generic industry and focused on providing 
equivalent products on the expiry of patents. The establishment of the Lennon Ltd Research 
and Development department in 1975, led to the registration of a wide range of generic 
prod ucts. Through the 1980s and 1990s, Lennon Ltd became an undisputed leader in the 
generics field.  
During 1997, from a converted house in Durban, Aspen Healthcare was founded by 
among others, Stephen Saad and Gus Attridge. Aspen was listed on the JSE through  reverse 
listing into Medhold Ltd and by 1999, had acquired the South African Druggist group (which 
included Lennon Ltd). At that time, the South African Druggist group was the oldest 
pharmaceutical business in South Africa.  
Moving from strength to strengt h is what Aspen is known for - from establishing 
Aspen Australia in 2001, to taking the lead in a broad -based economic empowerment deal in 
2002, to launching the first generic anti -retroviral drug in 2003, to constructing a state - of-
the-art facility in Po rt Elizabeth in 2004 (with two new facilities added in Port Elizabeth in 
2016 and 2018 and subsequent investments in manufacturing infrastructure currently taking 
place, to acquiring Fine Chemicals in Cape Town in 2004 ... the list continues.  
In 2002, Aspe n Pharmacare launched its new corporate identity which has grown to 
accommodate nearly 50 business units across the world. Aspen remains one of South Africa's 
success stories and one of the top 40 companies listed on the JSE. Aspen is established as a 
glob al player and a leading speciality and branded multi -national pharmaceutical company 
that provides treatment for a broad spectrum of acute and chronic health conditions 
experienced through all stages of life.  
In 2006, Aspen Holdings reported gross revenue of R3,4 billion - in 2018, the gross 
revenue was more than 10 times that, namely R42,6 billion, as released on 30 June 2018.  
83 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
The success of Lennon Ltd and the Aspen Group can arguably be ascribed to the vision and 
guidance of its leaders. Moreover, the deliberate attempts to stay ahead of the game has 
proven to be successful. Aspen and its leaders are committed to sustaining life and 
promoting healthcare through increasing access to its hi gh-quality, affordable medicines and 
products.  
Stephen Saad - the strategist  
As a strategist, co -founder and Group Chief Executive of Aspen, Saad is widely recognised for 
his astute leadership, passion, commitment and focus. There are many stories that tes tify to 
his out -of-the-box thinking while managing to stay focused on the end goal: continuous 
improvement of efficiencies and performance. One example of his strategising activities is 
from 2001, when Aspen expanded its operations to Australia with only t wo people and two 
laptops. Saad and his team followed a simple strategy to enter the Australian market: Aspen 
hired doctors, who had been forced to retire at ages 60 to 65, as sales representatives. They 
obtained access to practising doctors more readily t han ordinary sales representatives did. 
They were rejuvenated and highly motivated.  
Aspen, under the leadership of Saad and his senior management team, continues to 
increase the number of lives benefiting from their products, reaching more than 150 
countri es across the world. Aspen supplies products to more than 150 countries, has 23 
manufacturing facilities at 15 sites on six continents and employs approximately 10 000 
people.  
In South Africa, Aspen was a driving force in the development of the Public Heal th 
Enhancement Fund, a three -year partnership between the public and private health sector in 
South Africa, which invests millions of funds in assisting government to address a number of 
public healthcare priorities identified by the Department of Health.  
Saad's philosophy on strategising is evident in his commitment to the company's 
employees. 'There's a basic value system we drive in the business. We give ownership and 
trust to our people and let them make many of the decisions. That's the biggest aspect to 
Aspen's success.' Saad also confirms that the company invests heavily in capital projects, 
which provide an important strategic advantage to the group by enabling it to add value to 
its expanding portfolio of products that require complex manufacturing processes.  
When asked about the ingredients of leadership, Saad stated 'Always understand 
where you come from and stay true to your roots. Remember how you treated clients with 
humility at the beginning and continue to show them the same respect that we ha ve become 
known for.'  
Saad and his team are constantly on the lookout for opportunities, challenges and 
competitor actions and build their strategies on a clear understanding of the past, which 
informs the future: 'Don't look back except to learn.' Saad al so explains that perseverance 
has been the single most important contributor to what Aspen has achieved. He explains that 
another critical factor to his success as a strategist is a thorough understanding of the detail 
- having a thorough understanding of the environment, the operating conditions and all 
role-players.'  
84 CHAPTER 4: STRATEGISING AND STRATEGISTS  
On strategising, Saad confirmed that it is extremely important to have both a clear vision 
and a plan. He explains that it can cha nge at any point but it must be both simple and 
understandable to all. 'Make sure you really understand the details of your business - the 
critical detail, then list five or six priorities and ensure that you and your team focus on those 
priorities.'  
He also advises surrounding yourself with people who are more competent than you 
are in the areas they specialise in and that you should not be threatened by competence. 'I 
believe that one of the critical factors for ensuring success is to trust those you ha ve 
appointed to lead your businesses’  
Aspen offers shareholders a proven record of accomplishment. The company is widely 
recognised as being a responsible corporate citizen. Aspen remains globally competitive 
through its centralised regulatory, supply chai n and procurement resources that provide a 
competitive advantage to the group. The ongoing focus on the continuous improvement of 
efficiencies and performance sets a strong foundation from which to operate.  
LO 1:  Differentiate  between  the process  and pract ice perspectives  of strategic  
management.  
4.1 The process and practice perspectives of 
strategic management  
The traditional perspective of strategic management as a formal and rational process has 
attracted considerable criticism for various reasons. One of these is that the process 
perspective is limited and out of touch with the complexities of strategy as it happens in 
reality. On the one hand, it tends to regard strategies as being formulated through relatively 
formal structures and systems, with not much  attention being given to the effects of 
interpersonal relations and political processes.1 Practice research and a practice -oriented 
perspective of strategic management, on the other hand, takes interpersonal relations and 
political processes into account and aims to understand the messy realities of how strategies 
are formed.  
The process perspective of strategic management has its origins in the 1980s and 
processes are considered as sequences of individual and collective events, actions and 
activities deve loped over time. Although the process perspective initially gained support 
from many scholars, it was later criticised as being an approach that did not go far enough 
in attending to the actual micro -practices (the acts of strategists) and everyday routine s of 
strategy crafting. Scholars and practitioners around the world called for a perspective on 
strategy that was more in touch with reality and acknowledged the various strategic actors, 
which are not limited to top managers only. While the process resear ch took important steps 
forward humanising strategy research and generating more dynamic theories, the practice 
perspective takes it further. The practice approach is seen as necessary for researching the 
fundamental details of strategy making.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
The practice perspective in strategic management is known as the strategy -as-practice 
perspective. The key insight of strategy -as-practice studies is that strategy work 
(strategising) relie s on organisational and other practices that significantly affect both the 
process and the outcome of resulting strategies. Thus, the scope of the strategy - as-practice 
perspective is wider than just the strategy formulation process itself. The practice 
perspective focuses on social practices as the basis for explaining strategy emergence. It 
seeks to identify the strategic activities reiterated in time by the diverse actors interacting 
in an organisational context.2 The strategy -as-practice perspective is concerned with the 
detailed aspects of strategising - how strategists think, talk, reflect, act, interact, emote, 
embellish, politicise, which tools and technologies they use, and the implications of 
different forms of strategising for strategy as an organ isational activity. The practice 
perspective is also concerned with what people do less often during board meetings, 
strategy breakaways and other occurrences. Strategy -as-practice researchers recognise the 
complexity of the process and the potential influ ence of organisational members, not only 
through formal organisational processes, but also in everyday activities.3 The strategy -as-
practice research field is not only focused on the micro activities, but also on the context 
within which these micro -activi ties take place.  
The strategy -as-practice perspective supports and builds on the strategy process 
perspective and views strategy as a situated, socially accomplished activity - meaning that 
it is done by people and influenced by their background and contex t. It refers to activities 
that are connected with particular practices such as strategic planning, annual reviews, 
strategy workshops and their associated discussions.  
The strategy -as-practice perspective distinguishes between strategy praxis (the 
work), strategy practitioners (the workers) and strategy practices (the tools). Figure 4.2 
depicts the conceptual framework that forms the foundation of the strategy -as- practice 
perspective.  
The three elements of praxis, practices and practitioners, depicted in Figure 4.2, are 
discrete but interrelated social phenomena. It is thus not possible to study one without also 
drawing on aspects of the others.

Strategising  
 
Figure 4.2 A conceptual framework of the strategy -as-practi ce perspective4 
86 CHAPTER 4: STRATEGISING AND STRATEGISTS  
Strategising occurs at the nexus between praxis, practices and practitioners. A, B and C 
represent stronger foci on one of these interconnections depending on the research problem  
to be addressed. What this means in practical terms is that the act of strategising (or 
strategy making) happens when practitioners (such as the CEO, the business consultant or 
the board of directors) use strategy tools and processes (such as the SWOT ana lysis or the 
balanced scorecard) during, for example, a strategy workshop. But, the practice perspective 
also takes this deliberate strategising further: the act of strategising is not always situated 
in a formal setting - often strategising emerges as the  organisation and its managers cope 
with changes in the environment and occurring as individuals or groups act in ways that 
influence the organisation in profound ways.  
¦ Praxis is linked to human action and encompasses ‘all the various activities involved i n 
the deliberate formulation and implementation of strategy’.5 In everyday terms, praxis 
refers to the flow of activities such as meeting, consulting, talking, calculating, 
writing, presenting, communicating, completing documents, and so on, that are 
employed to constitute strategies.6 
¦ Practices are the social, symbo lic and material tools through which strategy work is 
done. These tools are combined, co -ordinated and adapted to construct strategy 
practice, and include theoretically and practically derived tools such as Porter’s five 
forces of competition, a SWOT analy sis, resource -based view analysis and value 
chains, as well as material artefacts and technologies such as PowerPoint, flipcharts, 
and spreadsheets.7 Because of the unique characteristics of organisations, their 
managers and employees and the underlying or ganisational culture, practices are 
diverse and variable, which means that no single approach to strategy formulation and 
implementation is correct for all organisations. Organisations customise their 
strategising practices to suit their circumstances.  
¦ Practitioners, or strategists, are the actors - the individuals who draw upon practices to 
act. In this book, we prefer to use the term ‘strategists’. Practitioners/ strategists are 
interrelated with practices and praxis. They derive agency through their use of the 
practices, namely, ways of behaving, thinking, emoting, knowing and acting prevalent 
within their society, combining, co -ordinating and adapting the practices to suit their 
needs in order to act within and influence that society.8 
As alluded to earl ier, we accept that strategy is not only a deliberate, top -down process. 
Middle managers and operational -level employees are also important strategic actors or 
strategists. While their actions and influence on strategy may be unintended on an 
organisation level, middle managers and operational -level employees are significant for 
organisational survival and competitive advantage. In this book, we identify and discuss a 
wider range of actors as strategists, going beyond top managers to include other levels of  
employees, as well as the board of directors and consultants.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
LO 2:  Explain  theterm  ‘strategising'.  
4.2 Strategising  
Strategising is essentially what strategists do, and can be described as devising or 
influencing strategies. Through their actions, strategists influence the allocation of the 
organisation’s resources and control or influence key actions. The terms ‘strategising’ and 
‘strategy -making’ are often used interchangeably and include strategising activities. 
Strategising not only involves those inside the organisation, but also consulting firms, 
business schools, business media, academic journals, professional societies, enterprises and 
management in a joint endeavour that all recognis e as somehow strategic.9 For example, 
when we look at the case study, Stephen Saad, CEO of Aspen, clearly influences key 
actions of the organisation. But he does not do this on his own: he specifically refers to 
those who are appointed to lead the business , that is, the managers. The case also describes 
Aspen’s deliberate strategy as a growth strategy that led the organisation into new markets 
and product ranges. The next level of strategies may be more emergent in nature as an 
organisation’s strategy is pa rtly proactive and partly reactive. The following section 
describes strategising from a deliberate strategy and emergent strategy perspective.  
LO 3:  Differentiate  between  deliberate  and emergent  strategising.  
4.3 Deliberate and emergent strategising  
As explained in earlier chapters, strategy deals with what the organisation plans to do and 
achieve in the future. Strategic thinking entails an analytic and logical approach to 
establishing the future direction of the organisation and the action plans to ach ieve it. In 
Chapter 3, we explained that the process of strategic management comprises three distinct 
stages: planning, implementation and review. This implies that before a strategy can be 
implemented, it needs to be crafted. However, often, organisations  find themselves in a 
situation in which so much change has taken place between formulating and 
implementation, that the strategy needs reconsideration and/or alteration. Despite basing 
strategic decisions on a range of assumptions that were logically and conceptually 
developed, change can render the strategies obsolete, or force organisations to formulate 
strategies during the implementation process.  
Deliberate strategies  are implemented and realised as intended. In order for this to 
happen, three conditio ns need to be satisfied:  
1. The management team must know precisely what they wish to achieve and what 
they intend for the future of the organisation before any actions are taken.  
2. Organisation means collective action. All members of the organisation must 
believe in the strategy and work towards it.  
88 CHAPTER 4: STRATEGISING AND STRATEGISTS  
3. The strategy must be realised exactly as intended, with no external interference.10 
This is difficult given the pace of change in the contemporary business 
environment.  
For a strategy to be emergent, it may develop outside the original intentions of the original 
strategic plan. This does not mean that an organisation intentionally ignore s the original 
strategic plan - rather, it is a rethinking of strategy that is necessitated by immediate 
circumstances. Thus, strategy may suddenly be rationalised to mean something very 
different from what was originally intended.11 Emergent strategies  are actions taken by 
middle managers and other strategists within the organisation outside of the formal and 
deliberate strategic management processes. Middle managers are more involved with the 
operations of the organisation and are able to make changes to the strategies when 
required. This means that some strategic initiatives may arise initially without the 
awareness of the senior management team. Emergent strategy implies learning what works - 
taking one action at a time in search of that viable pattern o r consistency. It is also 
frequently the means by which deliberate strategies change. This does not mean that the 
senior management team loses control, but rather that strategies are open, flexible and 
responsive to allow the organisation to learn and adap t to its environment. Emergent 
strategising enables management to act before everything is fully understood. It enables the 
senior management team, who cannot be close enough to a situation or who cannot know 
enough about the varied activities of its organ isation, to surrender control to those middle -
level managers who have enough current and detailed information to shape realistic 
strategies. Whereas the more deliberate strategies tend to emphasise central direction and 
hierarchy, the more emergent strateg ies open the way for collective action and convergent 
behaviour. The approach of this book is that strategic and strategising decisions are not 
only a way of making sense of an emergent pattern of activity, but also a way of creating 
sense in the absence o f any such patterns, as a response to the anxieties of the human 
condition or to the uncertainties with which managers are characteristically faced.12 
Strategic decisions cannot always await consensus, commitment or visible action. When 
existing strategies  are no longer convincing, the decision complexes associated with them 
cease to be effective carriers of meaning, and new rationalisations of the world in the form 
of new decisions, however provisional, must be constructed in their place.  
All management le vels and employees have specific roles to fulfil in ensuring 
successful strategising. Often, a disconnect exists between the perspectives of the various 
role-players. For example, the senior management team of the organisation decides, after a 
strategic re view, to launch a new strategy. This new strategy involves a range of 
commitments, most of which have already been made, either in anticipation of the decision 
or in reactive response to market pressures (deliberate strategising). Many of the 
commitments a greed upon are modified along the way (emergent strategy) and at least one 
major part of the strategy is never implemented at all (unrealised strategy). Accordingly, 
the strategy of the organisation changes and the change is reflected both in management 
thinking and in the organisation’s dctions and behaviours. The next section focuses on the 
roles and responsibilities of strategists or strategy practitioners.  
89 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
LO 4:  Explain  the roles  and responsibilities  of strategists.  
4.4 Strategists  
A strategist is the ‘doer’ of the strategy. Whereas top managers have traditionally been 
regarded as the custodians of strategy, the idea that other people and even objects 
(artefacts) can also be strategists is  gaining ground. Any individual or group in the 
organisation that controls key or precedent -setting actions13 (for example, middle managers 
and strategy consultants) can be regarded as strategists. Since objects can also control or 
influence key actions, w e can extend this definition to include presentations, written 
documents, information systems, and so on.  
By accepting that strategists are not only from the top management echelons - or 
even appointed as strategists, we then also need to look at the diffe rent categories of 
strategists. For example, within the middle management level, individuals may exist that 
offer a range of skills that make them strategists and enable them to do strategy. 
Hodgkinson and Clarke14 found that individual strategists will, cognitively speaking, fall 
into one of four broad types: detail -conscious, big -picture conscious, non -discerning and 
cognitively versatile. Bear in mind that the complexity of the environment, the size of the 
organi sation, the experience levels of the managers and workers all influence the skills 
needed by strategists. Often strategists who fall within a combination of these categories 
are best suited to the unique circumstances in which the organisation finds itself . These 
categories of strategists are described in Table 4.1.  
Table 4.1 Category of strategists  
Strategists  Description  
Detail -conscious 
strategy workers  P-actitioners who are detail -conscious are highly analytic and 
driven by the minutiae of available data, with little or no regard 
for intuition. They have a tendency to approach problems in a 
step-by-step, systematic fashion.  
Big picture -conscious 
strategy workers  Practitioners who are big -picture conscious can become 
preoccupied with gaining an overview of the problem at the 
expense of the details. They are highly intuitive in orientation, 
with little or no regard for analytic approaches to problem solving 
and decision -making.  
Non -discerning 
strategy workers  Non -discerning practitioners deploy m inimal cognitive resources 
in order to derive strategic insight, being disinclined to process 
the detail or to extract a bigger picture from such detail. They 
rely on opinion and wisdom received from others and thereby 
relieve themselves of the burdens of analytic and intuitive 
processing altogether.  CHAPTER 4: STRATEGISING AND STRATEGISTS  
Strategists  Description  
Cognitively versatile 
strategy workers  These practitioners possess in equal abundance the inclination to 
attend to analytical detail and cut through that detail, as and when 
required. This type of practitioner is able to switch more readily 
between analytic and intuitive processing strategies.  
Various strategists, both internal and external, that influence organisational performance 
and strategic success are discussed below.  
4.4.1  Top managers as strategists  
The role of the top management team is to set the overall strategic direction of the 
organisation by formulating' the strategy, allocating the resources and reviewing the 
strategic success. They are responsible for gathering information from both the internal and 
external environment, and choosing strategies and actions to help the organisation gain a 
sustainable competitive advantage. They communicate this to middle -level ma nagement, 
explaining the rationale behind their strategic choices so that middle managers can link the 
strategies and strategic goals to implementation efforts.  
The top managers are also responsible for the review of strategies. They reflect upon 
their decisions and actions and this may lead to changes or new decisions and actions. 
Sensing or sense -making may also lead to new insights or realisations and may affect 
current or future decisions. The case study showed that the Aspen CEO, Stephen Saad, 
regul arly looked towards what happened in the past in order to learn from it. He also 
explained that organisational plans can change at any point and how important it is to 
understand the details of the business. Saad confirmed the importance of a thorough 
unde rstanding of the environment, the operating conditions and all role -players.  
A strategist who is responsible for guiding the strategic planning in an organisation 
is often referred to as a ‘strategic planning champion’ (SPC)15. An SPC is an expert in 
strat egic thinking with specific analytical and technical skills, including the ability and 
knowledge to apply strategic management concepts to the organisation and use 
management tools and planning models for strategic practices. There are three roles that 
SPC s must perform to work effectively - some strategists may be stronger in a specific role 
while others may offer a combination of these roles or have these roles fulfilled by 
members of their management team. Listed below are the three roles that SPCs must 
perform:  
¦ The social craftsperson integrates different expectations from groups and 
individuals to ensure buy -in into the overall strategic direction, creating a 
positive and common ground from which to plan the strategic future of the 
organisation. He or s he deals with tensions and conflicts, and changes a volatile 
situation into a positive one.

with the local routines and norms. He or she contextualises the strategy so that 
others can identify their own roles in it.  
¦ The known stranger ensures a balance between distance and closeness in the 
interaction between strategists and other parties to maintain objectivity while at 
the same time cultivating trust.  
The senior or top management team needs to have sufficient detail of the organisation to 
ensure that the strategising is sound and to be able to allocate scarce resources to put the 
strategies in place.  The practising strategy box below, illustrates the strategising abilities 
of one of South Africa’s top business leaders, Sizwe Nxasana.  
Practising strategy: Sizwe Nxasana, 
FirstRand group  
Sizwe Nxasana has an illustrious career and served in three differe nt industries where 
he made a marked difference.  
He started by establishing Sizwe 8t Co, the first black -owned audit practice in Kwazulu -
Natal. In 1996, he became the founding partner of NkonkiSizweNtsaluba, the first 
black -owned national firm of accountants, where he remained until March 1998. The 
firm is now the fifth largest audit firm in South Africa. He left to join Telkom SA as Chief 
Executive Officer in 1998.16 He turned Telkom around in the seven years that he served 
as CEO - changing it fr om a struggling state -owned enterprise to a formidable ICT 
company.  
He joined the FirstRand Group and led the group to record highs. Under his leadership, 
FNB has implemented affordable methods that people can use to do their banking in 
the convenience of their homes. For instance, he said, looking at cellphone banking, 
there are solutions for all people across the board.17 
4.4.2  Board of directors as strategists  
Boards of directors of companies, being the focal point and custodians for corporate 
governance, influence strategising in organisations. Although strategic decision making is 
done by senior management, the board of directors influences the overall direction and 
monitors the relationship between management and other stakeholders to ensure that the 
organisation is sustainable in the long term (refer to Chapter 1, Section 1.6, where we 
distinguished between the terms ‘shareholder’ and stakeholder'). Historically, boards of 
directors focused on strategy once annually, often at a one -to- two-day off -site w orkshop or 
lekgotla.  New trends indicate a change in this practice where board meetings become a 
discussion on strategy to ensure that appropriate progress is being made and that new 
competition or technology is being assessed in a fast -changing business e nvironment.

CHAPTER 4: STRATEGISING AND STRATEGISTS  
In South Africa, the King III Report on Corporate Governance and the King IV report on 
Corporate Governance for South Africa18 offer principles to oversee the functions and role 
of the board of directors. One of these principles requires the board to ensure that strategy 
be aligned with the purpose of the organisation. The board is also responsible for the 
appointment of a chief executive officer. It provides leadership by endorsing the chief 
executive officer to lead the process of strategy crafting. The role of the board is more 
aligned to monitoring and reviewing strategies than crafting them. However, the consulting 
firm, McKi nsey, surveyed board members to learn where they would most like to spend 
additional time and 66 per cent of the board members surveyed indicated they want to spend 
more time on strategy, and less time on compliance -related topics.19 The practising strateg y 
box below, illustrates the roles of the Board of Directors at Woolworths Holdings Limited.  
Practising strategy: Woolworths 
Holdings Limited (WHL )20 
The board process at Woolworths Holdings Limited is managed by the company 
secretary. The board and board committees meet on a quarterly basis and the board 
engages with management on performance against the strategy on a quarterly basis.  
Woolworths has three operating subsidiaries - Country Road Group, 
Woolworths and David Jones. Woolworths acquired the Austr alian department chain 
store, David Jones in 2014. The other Australian retail chain in the Woolworths 
portfolio is Country Road that contributed 16 per cent to its revenue in 2017.21 
The executive committees of Woolworths, David Jones and the Country Road  
Group oversee operational governance and meet monthly. Each business unit has a 
leadership team that reviews the strategic objectives and capital initiatives and 
assesses the risks and opportunities within their unit.  
The various board committees report b ack to the board on how they carried 
out their responsibilities. The committees assess their mandates annually as 
documented in their respective terms of reference and undertake internal reviews of 
their effectiveness. WHL board meetings are held on a regu lar basis in Australia to 
ensure that directors receive adequate exposure to the Australian retail market and the 
dynamics within which the WHL Group operates.  
Board role and function  
The WHL board is guided by a charter that is reviewed annually. The char ter includes a 
delegation of authority, which sets out the delegation of matters by the board to its 
committees and the Chief Executive Officer. There are a number of governance policies 
that complement the delegation of authority. These policies are revie wed annually, and 
the board approves all amendments.  
93 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
4.4.3  Middle managers as strategists  
Traditionally, the role of middle managers was seen to be limited to implementation. 
However, in the flattened organisational structure, middle management is now much closer 
to the strategic apex and makes a variety of contributions. Consequently, the new model of 
the middle manager is one that has a more strategic focus.  
Four strategic roles of middle ma nagers have  been identified These include:22 
1. Implementing deliberate strategy. This role  is aligned to the traditional  
view of strategic management, but remains valid in the contemporary business 
organisation, especially in relation to deliberate strategies. It deals with 
managerial interventions, actions and tasks to align the organisational action with 
the strategic intentions of top management. Middle managers’ abilities to 
understand, anticipate and manage the processes needed to secure positiv e and 
pervasive commitment to strategy is a critical general management 
implementation skill. Middle managers implement strategy by translating 
corporate strategy into action plans and individual objectives.  
2. Synthesising information. This refers to the int erpretation and evaluation  
of information. How middle managers understand and share information 
influences the success or failure of organisational strategies. Not only do middle 
managers provide information concerning internal and external events to top 
managers, but they are also responsible for passing information down to 
subordinates, which can reduce uncertainty and resistance to change. This flow of 
information forms a  valuable  foundation for management  
decision -making. Middle managers  combine  strateg ic macro -information  
and hands -on micro -information.  
3. Reshaping the strategic thinking of top management by selling to them strategic 
initiatives that diverge from their current conception of strategy. This role links 
with emergent strategising. Middle managers frequently become organisational 
champions for initiatives developed at the operating level. This role is distinct 
from product championing as it centres on influencing corporate management to 
adjust their current concept of strategy. It is define d as the persistent and 
persuasive communication of strategic options to top management.23 By 
proposing and defining issues for top managers, middle managers provide 
important contributions to an organisation’s strategic direction and thereby 
influence org anisational effectiveness.24 
4. Managing change and facilitating adaptability. Middle managers have downward 
influence and need to support, guide and alleviate the concerns and fears of 
subordinates. Formulating and implementing strategies go hand in hand wit h 
change, and middle managers play an important role in managing these change 
processes by adapting and amending work practices to align them to the changing 
environment. Middle managers are also required to deal with conflict. Within 
their areas of respon sibility, middle managers have the authority and 
responsibility to facilitate change.  
94 CHAPTER 4: STRATEGISING AND STRATEGISTS  
Middle managers contribute in various ways to strategising. Middle managers should be 
clear thinkers and be good at identifying what needs to be done and then guiding their 
subordinates to get it done.  
4.4.4  Consultants as strategists  
The management consulting industry is considered to be one of the most powerful forces 
shaping organisational strategy. Management consultants are practitioners who are 
considered knowledgeable about the business environment and organisations. They have a 
wealth of industiy contacts and good reputations based on experience. The practising 
strategy box below describes Deloitte Consulti ng’s philosophy in helping organisations 
craft and execute strategies.  
Guidance from outside the organisation is often sought, especially when managers 
inside the organisation lack expertise in a specific area, or when decision making has come 
to a standst ill. Furthermore, when an organisation experiences short - to medium -term 
staffing issues, consultants can fill the role of full -time employees. Most importantly, 
management consulting firms pool their resources, knowledge and experiences across 
industries and are authoritative forces in advising on best practices.  
Practising strategy: Deloitte Consulting  
Helping organisations innovate, transform, and lead  
'As the world's largest management consulting business, Deloitte is distinct in its 
ability to help cli ents solve their most complex problems, from strategy to 
implementation. We are differentiated by our capability to execute the advice we 
provide to help clients in the markets where they operate today and where they 
want to be in the future. Delivering th is kind of value requires the skills to integrate 
a broad range of talent and skills - across human capital, strategy and operations, 
and technology - aligned to the unique needs of our clients’ industry sectors, 
businesses, and organizations'.25 
'That is where Monitor Deloitte excels. Our strategy practice takes a 21st - century 
approach to strategy that, combined with our deep industry experience, positions 
us to collaborate with you to create executable strategies. Unlike our competitors, 
we can see strat egy through to implementation and, as a result, increase our 
impact. It is an approach that can help organizations move more quickly and 
pragmatically to take advantage of new opportunities while helping to mitigate 
risks along the way. And it can work for  your business'.26 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
4.4.5  Individuals as strategists  
From the strategy -as-practice perspective strategising activities are operationalised at 
different levels from the organisational to the individual. Strategising happens in a dynamic 
space through interactions between workers on different levels. From the preceding 
sections, it should be clear that we not only consider the top managers to be the strategists, 
but confirm that the doers of st rategy are found on all levels of the organisation. In fact, 
there may be strategists on the lowest level of the organisation as the immediate 
environment calls for swift reaction to changes in the business environment. It may be 
argued that the nature of the strategic work on the lower levels of management is mostly 
emergent and more operational in nature. When we break down strategy work on an 
individual level, we appreciate the micro -level strategising. Yet, the work of these 
individuals ought to be reco gnised in shaping the overall strategy.  
Strategic success is enhanced by the collective efforts of all the strategists. Success 
is enhanced, or limited, by the quality of the strategists and the degree to which they work 
together in sharing information, de bating ways to make strategic and operating 
improvements, and joining forces to solve problems. Strategists differ in their management 
styles, skills, values, attitudes, willingness to take risks, perception of success, concern for 
social responsibility, s hort-term versus long -term orientation and ethics.  
The big picture  
In this chapter, we get a glimpse of the complexity of strategy formation. On the one hand, 
there is the process perspective of strategic management that considers strategy formation 
as a formal process with specific management roles and tasks assigned to each stage in the 
process. On the other hand, the practice perspective offers a broader view of strategic 
management that not only considers a wider range of strategists (such as the board  of 
directors, top managers, middle managers and consultants), but also allows for the messy 
realities of doing strategy in practice. Both approaches are present in most organisations.  
Within the strategy -as-practice perspective, strategising is the result  of the 
interaction between strategy praxis, strategy practices and strategists. Formulating and 
implementing strategies should be proactive in nature, but due to the changing business 
environment, some strategies are reactive. Deliberate and emergent stra tegising is 
influenced by the business environment and the strategy practices and strategists. 
Deliberate strategies tend to emphasise central direction and hierarchy, while the more 
emergent ones open the way for collective action and convergent behaviour . 
96 CHAPTER 4: STRATEGISING AND STRATEGISTS  
Summary of learning outcomes  
LO 1: Differentiate between a process and a practice perspective of 
strategic management.  
The process perspective is a traditional approach to strategic management that follows a 
mostly linear process that is driven by the top management team and divided into three 
distinct stages or phases.  
The practice perspective of strategic management recognises the complexities of 
strategic management in reality and recognises that strategic management is not a linear 
process. The perspective is concerned with the detailed aspects of strategising by looking 
at how and why strategy is done and by whom.  
LO 2: Explain the term 'strategising'.  
Strategising is the act of making strat egy and happens when practitioners use strategy tools 
and processes to develop, implement, review and do strategy.  
LO 3: Differentiate between deliberate and emergent strategising.  
The difference between deliberate and emergent strategising lies in the formality, the 
people involved, the duration and the central direction. Emergent strategising takes place 
outside the formal strategic planning sessions and is deemed open, flexible and responsive 
to the environment. Deliberate strategising is more formal and originate from specific 
interventions and hierarchy.  
LO 4: Explain the roles and responsibilities of strategists.  
Strategists are found throughout the organisation, as well as outside of them. Different 
levels of managers, the board of directors, exter nal consultants and individuals on micro -
level form part of the group of strategists in an organisation. The involvement and 
responsibilities may differ between these strategists, but ultimately cach has a role in the 
doing of strategy.

The environment is what gives organisations their means of survival. In 
Chapter 1 (Section 1.6) we indicated that organisations source  inputs 
from the environment, transform that into outputs, which is then given 
back to the environment. The success of an organisation as a system is 
largely determined by its successful interactions with the environment. 
Structurally, the management envir onment can be divided into the 
micro -, market and remote environments. This chapter focus on the 
market and remote environments.  Our case study 'Uber comes to Africa', paints a picture of the 
traditional metered taxi industry that faces new competition since Uber 
entered the market. The world of business is characterised by 
competition and unpredictability, and it is essential for strategists, 
organisations and industries to adapt and be responsive to changes in 
its environment and not to  depend on their successes of the past. A 
dependence of successes of the past will be devastating with far - 
reaching implications.  
The effect of the environment on organisations and their 
strategic choices should not be underestimated or considered lightly . 
Instead, organisations and industries must be able to respond quickly 
to changing circumstances posing as threats and opportunities, and 
alter their strategies accordingly as they strive for a strategic fit 
between their organisation and the environment.  
Strategy is thus context -specific and while each organisation 
has unique internal and external contexts, the primary focus of this 
chapter will be on the external context, in other words, the 
environment outside the boundaries of the organisation, called the 
external (or macro -) environment. The external environment comprises 
two sub -environments, namely, the market and remote environments, 
which were explained in Chapter 1 (Section 1.6). Understanding these 
environments and their strategic context is vita l to making strategic 
choices that will guide and direct the organisation. While the previous 
chapters focused more on how strategy is crafted, this chapter 
provides important tools that strategists can use to gain insight into 
the strategic context of the ir organisations and develop a strategic 
perspective of the organisation and its environment. Figure 5.1 depicts 
the focus of this chapter in relation to the broader strategic 
management process.  
In this chapter, we will first explain the external environm ent in 
the context of strategic management. Second, an explanation will be 
provided for the importance of strategic context in strategic planning 
and decision -making. Third, an analysis of the remote environment for 
the purposes of identifying the opportun ities and threats facing an 
organisation will be addressed. Then, attention will be given to the 
analysis of the market environment, in order to identify opportunities 
and threats to an organisation. Lastly, strategic responses to a 
changing external envir onment will be explained.

Case study  
Uber comes to South Africa  
There was a time, in the early days of motorised transport, when cars were not allowed to 
drive faster than 6.4km per hour and commercial motor vehicles were not allowed on public 
roads unless someone carrying a red flag walked in front of it. These were among a series of 
draconian laws enacted in Britain and parts of the USA from the mid -1860s, reportedly 
backed by railroad barons who were scared of the competition posed by the new founded 
'road locomotives’.1 
Some 120 years later, a similar battle is playing itself out on the streets of cities in 
South Africa. This time, the disruptor is the ride -hailing smartphone application, Uber, and 
the part of the rail barons is being played by the traditional metered -taxi industry.2 Uber 
launched in South Africa  in 2012 and has since redefined the traditional industry model for 
taxi operators. The Table 5.1 lists various consumer and competitor dimensions of the taxi 
industry and compares the traditional metered taxi and the Uber taxi in terms of these 
dimensions .

Table 5.1 Traditional metered taxis versus Uber taxis  
Consumer and 
competitor dimensions 
of the taxi industry  Traditional metered 
South African taxis  Uber taxis  
Reserving a taxi  Customers wander the 
streets looking for a 
cab or wait at a depot 
or call a central office 
and wait.  Customers connect to the Uber 
application on smartphones and reserve 
a taxi.  
The taxi ride  The main aim of the 
taxi driver is to get the 
customer to his or her 
destination.  Taxi drivers perform their best since 
they are aware that services are rated 
and poor service rendered will 
influence future business.  
Payment method  The taxi meter or the 
route travelled, 
determines the price 
charged by the 
metered taxi. 
Customers pay 
metered taxi drivers in 
cash.  The cost of using Uber is debited from 
the customer's bank account and no 
cash payments are necessary. Uber 
calculates the price by taking the 
following into account:3 
(i) base fare: the price for pick up;  
(ii) time: from start to the end of the 
trip; (iii) distance: kilometres of the 
route travelled; (iv) surge price (if 
applicable); and (v) tolls and other 
fees (if applicable). The base fare, time 
and distance rates will differ 
depending on the vehicle option 
chosen by the customer and the city.  
After the taxi ride  Services rendered are 
not rated.  The customer rates the driver and the 
driver can improve his or her 
reputation for future customers.  
Uber (a software development organisation) has experienced explosive growth around the 
world since it was founded in San Francisco in the USA in 2009 with just a single car. A 
valuation of Uber in February 2018 estimated it at a staggering US$72 billion (approximately 
R850 billion at the average US$/Rand exchange rate of R11.80 at the time of the valuation).  
Hostility to Uber  
Mention the word Uber  and it is bound to set off a range of comments. Despite consumer 
willingness to try out and adopt Uber, it has run into obstacles in a number of its markets, 
both in deve loped and developing countries. The South African metered taxi companies and 
taxi operators are fighting back, co -ordinating protest marches and calling on the 
government to clamp down on Uber, which they accuse of flouting the laws that regulate  
104 CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
public transport. Uber drivers are also intimidated by other metered taxi drivers claiming 
that Uber is stealing their business and operating illegally. However, more often than not, 
people who  make use of Uber did not previously use metered cab taxis4 and Uber flourishes 
globally.  
LO 1:  Explain  the external  environment  in the context  of strategic  management.  
5.1 The external environment in the context of 
strategic management  
No organisation exists within a vacuum, and organisations should always be viewed as 
open systems - influenced by changes in its environment. For example, new trends in 
technology, nature and society are slowly revolutionising the business environment on a 
global and unprecedent ed scale5 - no organisation can escape these changes as was also 
illustrated in the case study. This ‘globality’ is characterised by greater interconnectedness 
and interdependencies between countries and organisations. These forces emanating from 
the exter nal environment exert an enormous amount of influence on organisations. 
Strategists in organisations are therefore required to respond appropriately to changes in 
their remote environments. Furthermore, as industry players, they should be able to adapt 
or actively change their market environments to enhance their competitive positions and 
survive.6 
‘Going green’, ‘eco -friendly’ and ‘sustainable practices’ are now commonly 
accepted and are more than just buzz words or jargon. One of the aims of Uber, as 
discussed in the case study, is to improve the transportation ecosystem, proving itself as an 
organ isation concerned about the natural environment. A growing number of customers, 
employees, investors and other stakeholders are demanding that organisations behave 
‘responsibly’ in terms of the natural environment (where the natural environment is only 
one of the variables in the external environment). As such, a new compact between 
business and society is being advocated where ‘business as usual’ is no longer an option. 
The term ‘compact’ refers to an agreement between various parties.  The agreement is the  
decision, approval and acceptance of a new arrangement/relationship (whether formal or 
informal) which is being advocated between business and society in general. The United 
Nations Global Compact (UNGC), for example, is a call to organisations around the  world 
to align their strategies and operations with ten universal principles. These principles are 
human rights, labour, the environment and anti -corruption. Three specific principles were 
formulated for the environment theme, where the ‘environment’ refe rs to the physical or 
natural environment (as a variable in the remote environment of organisations). First, 
organisations should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. 
Second, organisations should undertake initiatives to promote gr eater environmental 
responsibility. Lastly, organisations should encourage the development and diffusion of 
environmentally friendly technologies.7 
105  
PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Historically, the business world has primarily always considered internal stakeholders 
(such as business owners, investors, employees and management) in developing strategy. 
Business is now increasingly under pressure to deal comprehensively with external 
stakeholders (such as the communi ty, government, activist groups, competitors, the media, 
and so on) as well (you may refer back to the explanation of the classification of 
stakeholders in Chapter 1, Section 1.7). Therefore, a profound understanding of the 
external environment gained thro ugh knowledge of the interests and influence of key 
external stakeholders is paramount to strategic decision -making and planning, and is 
recognised as a source of strategic value.8 
The context within which organisations exist is defined by their markets and remote 
environments. Figure 5.2 depicts the organisation and its environment, consisting of the 
micro -environment (over which management has control) and its market - and remote

Figure 5.2 The organisation and its environment  
Two levels of the analysis of the macro -/external environment, that will influence the 
organisation’s strategic direction and strategic actions, can be identified, namely:  
1. Analysis of the rem ote environment. This analysis focuses on the identification 
and forecasting of trends pertaining to political, economic, socio -cultural, 
technological, legal, environmental (or natural) and global variables.  
 
106 CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
2. Analysis of the market environment. This analysis focuses on the key role - 
players in this environment (such as customers, competitors, the labour market 
and unions, intermediaries and suppliers), along with the factors and conditions 
influencing an industry’s profit potential.  
Although these analyses will be discussed separately in this chapter, performance is like ly 
to improve when the organisation integrates the results of both analyses.9 The analysis of 
the remote and market environments will be explained in more detail in Sections 5.3 and 
5.4 of this chapter.  
LO 2:  Explain  the importance of strategic context in strategic planning and  
decision -making.  
5.2 The importance of strategic context in strategic 
planning and decision -making  
The boundaries and interfaces that exist between organisations and the external 
environment are relatively fluid and cannot be defined easily or clearly. As a result, 
unexpected changes in the external environment may occur from time to time, and 
strategists need to be prepared to react to these changes. Under such conditions, timely and 
accurate information about the environment is criti cal for strategic decision -making and 
planning. For example, if organisations know very little about the preferences of their 
customers and their future trends, they will have difficulty designing new products and/or 
services, setting up a production sched ule, or developing strategic and marketing plans.  
However, the reality is that strategists often do not have enough information about 
the external environment readily available. They are operating in turbulent industries and 
can be challenged even further when they have to operate under conditions of rapid change 
and uncertainty. Strategists are not only constrained by a lack of information about the 
environment, but also by a limited ability to understand and predict the future.  
Ideally, for strategic deci sion -making and planning to be effective, strategists must 
not only understand the context of their current management environments, but also the 
context of their future management environments.  
An organisation’s success is, to a certain extent, determined  by the characteristics of 
the industry in which it exists and the market for which it competes. Furthermore, different 
industries are characterised by different competitive conditions and dynamics. Hence, when 
viewed in relation to competitors, as well as  to competitive threats  and opportunities  
existing in the external environment, all organisations have inherent strengths  and 
weaknesses  and are exposed to external threats  and opportunities :10 
107 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
¦ Strengths are internal organisational resources and capabilities that can lead to a 
competitive advantage (Chapter 1, Section 1.8 provides an explanation of 
competitive advantage).  
¦ Weaknesses are  internal resources  and capabilities that an organisation may  
not possess yet but are necessary, resulting in competitive disadvantage  
until the organisation acquires them.  
¦ Opportunities are conditions in the external environment that allow an  
organisation to  take advantage  of organisational strengths, overcome  
weaknesses, and/or neutralise environmental threats.  
¦ Threats are conditions in the external environment that may stand in the way of 
organisational competitiveness or the achievement of stakeholder satisfaction.  
If strategists do not un derstand the strategic context, in other words, how the external 
environment affects their organisations, their ability to make decisions, formulate and 
execute plans will be severely limited.11 When studying the organisation in relation to its 
external en vironment and key role -players in this environment, strategists should:  
¦ take advantage  of inherent or  internal strengths and the identified  
opportunities arising from the external environment  
¦ overcome inherent weaknesses, or neutralise identified threats found in the 
external environment in order to ensure the strategic ‘fit’ or consistency between 
the opportunities and threats in the external environment and the strengths and 
weaknesses in the internal environment.  
Strategic direction is an outcome of mel ding the desires and expectations of key 
organisational stakeholders with environmental realities.12 Therefore, a profound 
understanding of the external environment, coupled with an understanding of its key role -
players, is paramount to charting an organis ation’s road to success. Understanding the 
external strategic context should lead to the identification of strategic alternatives and 
provide a basis for crafting strategies, as well as providing the organisation with a 
foundation for all other tasks of st rategic management. The next section focuses on the 
remote environment, as a sub -environment of the external (or macro -) environment.  
LO 3:  Analyse  the remote  environment  to identify  opportunities  and threats  facing  
an organisation.  
5.3 Analysing the remote environment  
To a large extent, organisations can only respond to the fundamental forces arising from 
the remote environment. While individual organisations can exert some influence over their 
market environments, they can rarely influence the remote enviro nment (except, for 
example, through radical technological innovation, as in the case of organisations such as 
Intel or Microsoft in the microprocessor, microcomputer and software industries).  CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
In the discussion that follows, we will first identify the remote environmental forces, and 
will then discuss the remote environment in an African and regional context. Lastly, we 
will address the evaluation of an organisation’s strategic response to factors  in the remote 
environment.  
5.3.1  The identification of remote environmental forces  
The most important elements of the remote environment can be identified using the 
traditional PEST framework. They comprise the following factors:13 political (P), economic 
(E), socio -cultural (S)  and technological (T) factors.  The traditional PEST model can be 
extended to include a consideration of legal  (L), environmental  (E) and global  (Gj factors, 
(where (E) refers to the natural environment) to yield the acronym PESTLE/G. You  may 
also refer to Chapter 1 (Section 1.6) in which the management environment is explained.  
Analysing the environmental forces and trends at a global, a regional and a domestic 
level, respectively, is important because it can have an impact on an organisa tion and its 
internal/micro - and market environments. Below are just a few examples of the 
implications that external environmental forces hold for markets and organisations:14 
¦ Political factors. Political factors include aspects such as the government and  its 
political policy and economic interventions and policies. The government of a 
country is a major role player in the remote environment of all organisations. An 
example of political forces in South Africa is the change of leadership in the 
ruling party , namely the African National Congress (ANC). On 14 February 2018, 
the former president Jacob Zuma resigned and was replaced by President Cyril 
Ramaphosa. This had an enormous effect on various indicators, for example, the 
value of the country’s currency a nd business confidence. Business confidence can 
be measured in terms of the Business Confidence Index, which is the weighted 
mean of five sectoral indices, namely, that of manufacturers, building 
contractors, retailers, wholesalers and new vehicle dealers.  Business confidence 
can vary between 0 and 100, where 0 indicates an extreme lack of confidence, 50 
indicates neutrality and 100 indicates extreme confidence.13 Index Points in 
South Africa increased to 45 Index Points in the first quarter of 2018 from 34  
Index Points in the fourth quarter of 2017 - an increase of 11 points.16 As a result 
of these influences, business organisations are also affected. For example, an 
increase in business confidence may result in organisations investing more in 
new machinery , equipment or buildings in order to increase their productive 
capacity in lieu of an expected increase in the demand for their products. Also, 
consumers will spend more, and foreign investors will be more willing to invest 
in South African organisations d ue to higher business confidence levels. South 
Africa has seen many key economic policy changes by government, especially for 
the period 1994 to 2013. The Reconstruction and Development Programme 
(RDF), as part of the election platform of the ANC  
109 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
in the 1994 elections, was chosen as the primary socio -economic programme with 
the aim to establish a more equal society through reconstruction and 
development, as well as strengthening dem ocracy for all South Africans. Due to 
various constraints, the government replaces this policy in 1996 by a new macro -
economic policy framework called the Growth, Employment and Redistribution 
(GEAR) strategy, with the aim to stimulate faster economic grow th, which was 
required to provide resources to meet social investment needs. In 2005, GEAR 
was replaced by the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa 
(ASGISA) as further development on the first two developmental strategies. 
ASGISA had t he following aims: to reduce poverty by 2010, and to halve 
unemployment by 2014 from the 28 per cent in 2004 to 14 per cent by 2012. It 
also recognised that the policies implemented to address these issues needed to 
be at the forefront of economic policy d ecision -making. ASGISA was replaced in 
2010 with the New Growth Path (NGP), envisioned to accelerate growth in the 
South African economy, and to do so in ways that rapidly reduces poverty, 
unemployment and inequality. In 2013, government introduced the Nat ional 
Development Plan (NDP) 2030 as South Africa’s socio -economic development 
roadmap. This policy was adopted as the blueprint for a future economic and 
socio -economic development strategy for the country. The NDP is viewed as a 
policy blueprint for elim inating poverty and reducing inequality in South Africa 
by 2030. In order to address the country’s socio -economic imbalances, the NDP 
identifies the key constraints to faster growth, among other things, and presents a 
roadmap to a more inclusive economy.17 
¦ Economic factors. These include factors such as the economic  growth  
rate, the inflation rate, interest rates and exchange rates. Economic forces 
influence the demand for products and services, so it is important for strategists 
to monitor and forecast eve nts in the domestic and global economies. Economic 
forces are often interdependent with socio -cultural forces. For instance, an ageing 
population can influence unemployment figures and salaries of a younger 
workforce significantly.  
¦ Socio -cultural factors. These include factors such as social values,  culture,  
lifestyles and demographics. Stakeholder groups are products of  society.  
Their values, morals, beliefs and subsequent behaviours and lifestyles are 
therefore influenced by society at large. Developing s ocial trends may also offer 
organisations various opportunities. For example, health and fitness lifestyle 
trends have created opportunities in the home fitness, nutritional supplement, low 
carbohydrate food and even bicycle industries. Organisations there fore stand to 
gain if strategists can identify and assess the effects and opportunities presented 
by socio -cultural forces, as well as manage and sustain their relations and 
reputation with stakeholder groups.  
110 CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
¦ Technological factors. These include factors such as research and development, 
new products and processes, and new technologies. The innovation and 
technology fields have grown exponentially in recent years. They are 
continuously drivin g the development of new products and services, thereby 
creating new industries. They also have the power to transform society and 
revolutionise the way business is conducted. This is evidenced by the rise of the 
internet, as well as by the communication a nd computing industries. Innovation 
and technology can spill over from one industry to another, especially if they are 
closely related. The opening case study indicated that technology is responsible 
for changes in the metered taxi industry. Uber became a major role -player in this 
industry, which reinforces the statement that organisations should also monitor 
developments in innovation and technology in neighbouring, related and even 
unrelated industries. Strategists need to evaluate the consequences for th eir own 
products and services, creating strategies that could take advantage of these 
changes.  
¦ Legal factors. These include factors such as regulations and laws with which 
organisations must comply. No organisation is fully exempt from government 
legislati on and regulations. However, not all laws and regulations apply equally 
to all organisations. Some (such as smoking laws) pertain to specific industries, 
whereas other legislation (such as occupational health and safety, labour 
relations, and employment eq uity in South Africa) cuts across entire industries. 
In our case study, it was indicated that the South African government finds it 
difficult to regulate the new industry created by Uber. Once regulated, it will 
have an influence on Uber, as well as on the  metered taxi industry.  
¦ Environmental factors. These include ecological and environmental forces of 
nature such as weather, climate, climate change and associated factors such as 
water shortages. The Western Cape water crises in 2017/2018, as a result of 
prolonged drought, is affecting all industries in South Africa, especially the 
agricultural, hospitality and tourism industries. Even households and individuals 
are affected. For example, in 2018 Cape Town households were faced with water 
and sanitation tar iff increases of approximately 27 per cent. An increase in these 
tariffs will have a negative effect on consumer behaviour and spending patterns, 
influencing all industries. The principles of the UNGC, alluded to earlier in 
Section 5.1, calls on organisati ons to align their strategies to their environmental 
principles.  
¦ Global factors. Organisations are operating in an increasingly global economy. 
Examples of global trends18 which have the potential to significantly affect and 
challenge strategists and leade rs in the next 30 years are briefly discussed in 
Table 5.2.

Increasing  
population  The world's population is 
increasing fast from 7.6 billion in 
June 2018 to an expected 9.7 
billion by 2050.19 The South 
African population, as on 4 June 
2018, based on the latest United 
Nations estimates, is 57,348,01520 
and is expected to grow to 
72,754,583 by 2050.21 The need for basic necessities, such as 
food, water and housing, will increase 
as the population increases, while, at 
the same time, water and food sources 
will come increasingly under pressure 
due to diminishing farmland and 
pollution.  
Increasing  
urbanisation  Megacities with 10 million or more 
inhabitants will become 
commonplace. In South Africa, 
Johannesburg is set to be 
classified as a megacity by 2030, 
with its population exceeding 10 
million people22, while Lagos, 
Cairo and Kinshasa will each have 
to cater for over 20 million 
people.23 Due to the high urbanisation rate, the 
need for various products and services 
(such as the need for education, water, 
electricity, housing and medical 
services) to mention only a few, 
increases.  
The spread of 
infectious 
disease  Migration and cross -border flow 
of labour and goods are 
increasing, causing the likelihood 
of epidemics and the spread of 
infectious diseases such as 
hepatitis A, typhoid fever, and 
malaria. An outbreak of listeriosis 
(a serious foodborn e disease) has 
been ongoing in South Africa 
since the start of 2017. There were 
978 laboratory -confirmed cases 
and 183 fatalities reported over 
the period 1 January 2017 to 14 
March 2018.  Infectious diseases (such as malaria 
and meningitis) cause a growing  
demand for preventative measures 
(such as insect repellents and 
inoculations) and treatment options.  
Outbreaks of foodborne diseases 
may require strategists to place more 
emphasis on preventative quality 
controls, and to act quickly in the 
case of an outb reak. The food 
processing company and three of its 
retailers export to 15 countries in the 
African region. All of the affected 
countries had to recall the implicated 
products.24 
112 CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
Global trends  Explanation  Examples of implications 
for strategists  
Natural resource 
crises  The global natural resource crises are 
worse than its financial crises. The 2016 
Living Planet Report25 calculates that 
humans are using 30 per cent more 
natural resources than the Earth can 
replenish each year, which is leading to 
deforestation, degraded soils, polluted 
air and water, and dramatic declines in 
the number of fish and other species. 
The probl em is also getting worse as 
populations and consumption keep 
growing faster than technology can find 
new ways of expanding what can be 
produced from the natural environment. 
This has led to the prediction that by 
2030, if nothing changes, humankind 
will ne ed two planets to sustain its 
lifestyle.26 In Africa and South Africa 
specifically, the need for and conflict 
over water resources are prominent.27 
Since 2014, the City of Cape Town has 
been experiencing a record drought for 
three consecutive years (the wo rst in 
more than a century). The drought, 
exacerbated by climate change and 
population growth, has sparked a water 
crisis in Cape Town. In March 2018, 
municipal leaders warned that residents 
are increasingly likely to face a 'Day 
Zero' scenario. Day zero i s defined as 
the day when the supplying dams are 
depleted, and residents are expected to 
live on less than 25 litres per day. If the 
city is unable to deal with the crisis, then 
four million people may have to stand in 
line surrounded by armed guards to 
collect rations for drinking water.28 Organisations will 
increasingly be required to 
operate in ways that are 
environmentally sustainable 
by reducing their carbon 
footprint, reducing waste 
and reducing their water 
usage.  
113 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Global trends  Explanation  Examples of implications 
for strategists  
Environmental  
degradation  Biodiversity is often used as an indicator of 
the state of the natural environment since it 
refers to the diversity of micro -organisms, 
plants and animal species, as well as to the 
ecosystems within which they interact and 
live. The 2016 Living Planet Report indicates 
the Living Planet Index (LPI), which 
measures biodiversity by gathering 
population data of various vertebr ate 
species and calculating an average change 
in abundance over time. The LPI can 
therefore be regarded as an important 
indicator of the planet's ecological 
conditions. From 1970 to 2012, the LPI 
shows a 58 per cent overall decline in 
vertebrate species (m ammals, birds, fishes, 
amphibians and reptiles). The most 
common threat to declining populations is 
the loss and degradation of habitat. This 
refers to the modification of the 
environment where species lives, by either 
complete removal, fragmentation or 
reduction in quality of key habitat 
characteristics. Common causes are 
unsustainable agriculture, logging, 
transportation, residential or commercial 
development, energy production and 
mining. For freshwater habitats, 
fragmentation of rivers and streams and 
abstraction of water are common threats. 
Species over exploitation, pollution, invasive 
species, disease and climate change are 
further threats and contribute to 
environmental degradation.29 The decline in 
species populations is inextricably linked to 
the s tate of the ecosystems that sustain 
them. Destruction of these ecosystems 
represents a risk, not just to plants and 
animals, but to humans as well - ecosystems 
provide us with food, fresh water, clean air, 
energy, medicine and recreation. Human life 
depend s upon healthy and diverse natural 
systems for the regulation and purification 
of water and air, climate conditions, 
pollination and seed dispersal, and control 
of pests and diseases.  Organisations will 
increasingly have to 
understand the impact that 
its current and future 
operations will have on 
biodiversity and the 
ecological systems that 
they operate in. This is 
already becoming part of 
the legal environment.  
For example, in South 
Africa Environmental 
Management Inspectors 
(also known as the 'Green 
Scorp ions') specifically 
police for transgressions of 
environmental laws and 
regulations.  
114 CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
Global trends  Explanation  Examples of implications for 
strategists  
Economic  
integration  Economic integration refers to an 
agreement between countries in a 
geographic region to reduce and 
ultimately remove, tariff and non -
tariff barriers to the free flow of 
products or services and factors of 
production among each other.30 
Economic integration is a 
phenomenon of the second half 
of the 20th century that has been 
experienced on a varying scale 
and intensity throughout the 
world. Countries from all 
continents seem eager to join 
economic alliances that range 
from customs unions to areas of 
full economic int egration, such as 
the European Union. Strong and 
weak economies participate in 
such groups, aiming at stability 
and growth.  Inevitably, participating in these 
alliances conveys important changes 
in the domestic business 
environments of organisations.  
For e xample, the competition in the 
market environment of 
organisations may change 
completely as a result of economic 
integration. Changes in the quantity 
and quality of demand may also 
appear, requiring strategists to 
reconsider and change 
organisational strat egies based on 
these changes. South African 
President Cyril Ramaphosa on 20 
March 2018 punted the idea of a 
single currency for African countries 
in a bid to attract infrastructure 
investment and enable intra -African 
trade, a decision that will have an 
influence on all participating 
countries and organisations within 
these countries.  
Advances in 
technology and 
information 
technology  Advances in technology create 
new processes, systems, material, 
equipment and components.  
New technology enables 
organisations to develop new and 
innovative products and/or 
services. Advanced information 
systems can disseminate essential, 
timely and accurate information 
faster and more efficiently. New 
processes can increase the 
productivity of organisations. New 
technology and information 
technology results in increased 
competition and forces 
organisations to use the latest 
technology to sustain their 
competitive advantage.  Organisations need to be aware of 
technological changes and how they 
affect their businesses. While 
organisations can use technology to 
improve their own efficiency, they 
can also be the victims of 
technology. There is the obvious 
threat of hacking, which means that 
organisations have to pay very close 
attention to cybersecurity.  
On a more fundamen tal level, 
technology can enable new breeds 
of competitors and change the 
business landscape, as we saw in 
the Uber case study earlier in this 
chapter.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Global trends  Explanation  Examples of  implications for 
strategists  
Biotechnology  Biotechnology is defined as the use of 
biological processes, organisms, or 
systems to manufacture products 
intended to improve the quality of 
human life. The earliest 
biotechnologists were farmers who 
developed improved species of plants 
and animals by cross -pollination or 
cross -breeding. In recent years, 
biotechnology has expanded in 
sophistication, scope and applicability. 
The science of biotechnology can be 
broken down into subdisciplines called 
red, white, gr een, and blue.  
Red biotechnology involves medical 
processes such as getting organisms 
to produce new drugs or using stem 
cells to regenerate damaged human 
tissues and perhaps re -grow entire 
organs. White (also called grey) 
biotechnology involves industrial  
processes such as the production of 
new chemicals or the development of 
new fuels for vehicles. Green 
biotechnology applies to agriculture 
and involves processes such as the 
development of pest - resistant grains 
or the accelerated evolution of 
disease -resistant animals. Blue 
biotechnology, rarely mentioned, 
encompasses processes in marine and 
aquatic environments, such as 
controlling the proliferation of noxious 
water -borne organisms.31 Many 
organisations have begun 
investigating the application 
possibilit ies of biotechnology in their 
industries. Companies such as 
Motorola have begun investigating the 
potential of genetic engineering in 
computing as a first step toward a 
DNA -based computer.  While biotechnology offers many 
potential opportunities to 
organisa tions to increase their 
production and reduce their 
carbon footprint (for example, 
by using biofuel), it also has 
created heated debates around 
issues such as genetic 
manipulation of food, the use of 
stem cells from embryos in 
providing health services, an d 
cloning. Biotechnology is an area 
in which organisations need to 
be very aware of the ethical risks 
they face.

116 CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
Global trends  Explanation  Examples of implications for

Governance  The business dictionary defines 
governance  as the establishment 
of policies, and the continuous 
monitoring of their proper 
implementation, by the members 
of the governing body of an 
organisation. It includes the 
mechanisms required to balance 
the powers of the members (with 
the associated accountability), 
and their primary duty of 
enhancing the prosperity and 
viability of the organisation.32 
Corporate governance  is defined as 
the framework of rules and 
practices by which boards of 
directors ensur es accountability, 
fairness and transparency in an 
organisation’s relationship with all 
stakeholders,33 in order to 
improve the accountability of an 
organisation and to prevent 
massive disasters before they 
occur.  Corporate governance is an 
inevitable topic of discussion in 
corporate boardrooms, academic 
roundtables and among 
policymakers worldwide. Several 
events are responsible for this. 
First, corporate implosions over 
the last ten years and the 
subsequent increased demand for 
continuous improvement and 
transparency in the boardroom 
have heightened the pace of 
change for boards worldwide. 
Second, the wave of financial crises 
in Russia, Asia and Brazil in 1998, 
affected their entire economies 
and deficiencies in corporate 
governance endangered the 
stability of the global financial 
system. Third, corporate 
governance failures in the United 
States and Europe caused some of 
the largest insolvencies in history. 
In the aftermath of these events, 
economists, the corporate sector 
and the policymakers worldwide  
recognised the potential long term 
consequences of weak corporate 
governance systems.  
In the wake of more recent 
corporate scandals relating to 
KPMG and Steinhoff, for example, 
it is likely that we will see an 
increased focus on corporate 
governance, and an increasing 
focus on the role of supposed 
'watchdogs' such as auditing firms.  
The implications of these global trends for strategists and their organisations are far -
reaching. They have the potential to change individual organisations, entire industries  or 
even entire economies. In this context, the change can be drastic or a radical re -
organisation caused by trigger events and processes requiring change in  
117 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
order to improve the situati on. As an example, environmental degradation caused by motor 
vehicle carbon dioxide (C0 2) emissions (above a certain threshold) has seen the 
introduction of an environmental levy on new motor vehicles manufactured or imported 
into South Africa. The objecti ve of the levy is to ensure that the composition of South 
Africa’s motor vehicle fleet becomes more energy -efficient and environmentally friendly. 
However, the implication is greater for motor vehicle manufacturing industries and local 
automotive clusters or economic hubs (existing in countries such as Mexico and Thailand). 
The industry is expected, not only to reconfigure fuel consumption in motor vehicle 
design, but is also mandated to show C0 2 emission standards as part of vehicle 
certification.  
The prec eding example intends to illustrate how a global factor such as 
environmental degradation (caused by global warming due to the production of a 
greenhouse gas from motor vehicle C0 2 emissions) affects, not only driving behaviour, but 
also all motor vehicle manufacturers in all countries. Organisations attuned to similar 
challenges, which prepare for them and respond appropriately, will likely thrive; those that 
ignore them, will do so at their own peril.  
The practising strategy box below, provides an example  of another change in 
regulation that has a huge impact on all South African business organisations, namely Black 
Economic Empowerment.  
Practising strategy: Black Economic 
Empowerment  
The South African government launched the Black Economic Empowerment (BE E) 
programme as a racially selective programme to address the inequalities of apartheid. 
The programme gives Black, Coloured and Indian South African citizens economic 
privileges that were previously not available to them. In 2003, a strategy for BEE was 
released which defined the programme as:  
¦ 'an integrated and coherent socio -economic process that directly contributes to 
the economic transformation of South Africa and brings about significant 
increases in the numbers of black people that manage, own and c ontrol the 
country's economy, as well as significant decreases in income inequalities.  
¦ Thus, the BEE process will include elements of human resource development, 
employment equity, enterprise development, preferential procurement, as well 
as investment, ow nership and the control of enterprises and economic assets.'34 
118 CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
The initial programme was criticised for benefiting only a few of the previously 
disadvantaged groups, which led to the development of the modified programme in 
2007, called the Broad -based Black Economic Empowerment or B -BBEE. In this year, the 
new Codes of Good Practice of the B -BBEE and sector scorecards were gazetted by the 
government. In 2008, Chinese people were also added to the programme. In 2013, the 
Codes of Good Practice was again updated and gazetted by government. The new 
codes provided organisations with elements that it needed to prioritise, namely, 
ownership, skills development and enterprise development. In the context of strategic 
management, these elements should then become strategic priorities for South African 
organisations to be BEE -certified. A points allocation system, that accompanies the 
Codes of Good Practice, includes sub -minimum target thresholds  of 40 per cent for 
these priority elements. Failing to achieve these thresholds results in penalties whereby 
an organisation’s compliance level could be dropped.  
The B -BBEE programme has a significant impact on the strategic priorities of all 
South Africa n business organisations. Business organisations are encouraged to 
procure the products and/or services they need from other businesses that are B -BBEE -
compliant. Organisations that are not BEE -certified will therefore find it difficult to 
retain their pos itions in the marketplace.  
The next section focuses on the analysis of the remote environment in an African context.  
5.3.2  The remote environment in an African context35 
The ‘sleeping giant’ called Africa awakens - with great, but unrealised emerging power. 
While the continent presents significant business opportunities, the need to become a 
region with strong technological and innovative competitiveness is yet to he realised. 
Strategists, however, should be mindful of the following strategic issues plaguing Africa as 
a whole, and sub -Saharan Africa, in particular:36 
¦ Lack of infrastructure. The lack of roads, harbours, electricity, ICT networks and 
railroads may, for example, seriously affect an organisation’s supply chain and 
distribution system or even its a bility to implement a cross - border strategy.  
¦ Lack of industrial development. Most countries in Africa apply primary resource 
development in mining and agriculture but fail to develop, for example, 
industries for beneficiation or further processing, result ing in dependence on 
imports for local consumption and lower country productivity.  
¦ Political instability. From a business perspective, this may take the form of 
erratic and unpredictable government decisions or national and regional conflicts 
that may lead  to uncertainty and volatility in markets, and making strategic 
decisions riskier.  
119 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
¦ High levels of poverty. In most developing Southern African countries (South 
Africa, Botswana, Namibia,  Zambia and Lesotho), as well as the Comoros and the 
Central African Republic, there is a wide income inequality gap between rich and 
the poor.37 In addition, poverty eradication remains one of the greatest challenges 
in the region. A Southern African Deve lopment Community (SADC) Regional 
Vulnerability Assessment and Analysis Synthesis Report in 2016 indicated that 
40 per cent of all SADC citizens were living in abject poverty.38 The high levels 
of poverty and living conditions of the poor make high -quality  nutrition, 
education and healthcare inaccessible and unaffordable.  
¦ Corruption. While levels of corruption may be a global phenomenon, not solely 
confined to Africa, it significantly differs between countries according to the 
Corruption Perceptions Index 2 017.39 The index, which ranks 180 countries and 
territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption according to 
experts and business people, uses a scale of 0 to 100, where  
0 is highly corrupt and 100 is very clean. New Zealand and Denmark ran k 
highest with scores of 89 and 88, respectively. South Sudan and Somalia rank 
lowest with scores of 12 and 9, respectively. South Africa is ranked  
71 with a score of 43. The best performing region is Western Europe, with an 
average score of 66, and the worst -performing region is Sub -Saharan Africa, with 
an average score of 32. With the potential to generate anger and destabilise 
societies, the cumulative effect of corruption on organisations and economies 
could be massive.  
¦ An inefficient public sector. Sluggi sh and even negative economic growth that 
contributes to failure in alleviating poverty in sub -Saharan Africa is at least 
partly attributed to an inefficient and unproductive public sector.40 Public sector 
reform involves effectiveness, efficiency, account ability, performance 
management and, ultimately, service delivery to society. Studies on public sector 
inefficiencies have shown that public sector management tends to prioritise the 
interests of the government (who is also the provider of public resources ), even 
when the government’s interests are contrary to the needs of the people.41 South 
African studies have shown that progress has remained slow and limited because 
of political interference, unaccountable civil servants, non -compliance to reforms 
and t he overall decline in governance.42 
¦ Lack of key human resource skills. Limited access to education at various levels 
often results in an over -supply of unskilled and semi -skilled labour and a lack of 
people with the requisite skills to drive economic growt h and development.43 Key 
findings of the World Economic Forum Report on the Future of Jobs and Skills in 
Africa 2017 indicates that 9 per cent of employers surveyed in South Africa 
identified inadequately skilled workforces as a major constraint to their b usiness 
and expects the pattern to worsen in the future. The report further states that in 
South Africa alone, 39 per cent of core skills required across occupations will be 
wholly different by 2020.44 
120 CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
On the positive side, there are many African countries (such as Cote d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, 
Kenya, Mali, Rwanda, Senegal, and Tanzania) with stable economies and political 
dispensations. These countries promote economic growth, and realised annual  gross 
domestic product growth rates above 5.4 per cent from 2015 to 2017.45 Within the African 
context, organisations are encouraged and often required to work together with 
governments to achieve strategic objectives and attain competitiveness at nationa l, regional 
and Pan -African levels.46 
5.3.3  The remote environment in a regional context47 
Of particular interest to South African strategists and decision -makers is an understanding 
of the remote environment in a regional context. This comprises the sub -Saharan  region 
and specifically, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) group of 
countries. The SADC comprises 15 member states, namely Angola, Botswana, the 
Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, 
Namibia, the  Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.48 The 
main objectives of the SADC are ‘to achieve development, peace, security, and economic 
growth, to alleviate poverty, enhance the standard and quality of life of the peoples of 
South ern Africa, and support the socially disadvantaged through regional integration, built 
on democratic principles and equitable and sustainable development’.49 
While it is certain that Africa and the sub -Saharan region are developing strategies 
for its own f uture, organisations need to consider not only the challenges, but also the 
opportunities for organisations outside its region, to conduct business in Africa. Strategists 
should accommodate the continental strategic approach and factor a country’s disposit ion 
in terms of its local conditions and customer preferences. Strategic decision -making should 
also acknowledge the role that government, as an economic enabler, plays in strategy 
development. Africa presents an opportunity for addressing the needs of the  majority poor 
at the ‘Bottom of the Pyramid’ (BOP) market.50 Broadly stated, the BOP is a socio -
economic concept that allows us to categorise the poorest socio -economic group in a 
country or society. This segment of people represents an invisible and unse rved market 
confronted by challenging barriers that prevent them from realising potential benefits for 
them, their families and society.51 
Members of the BOP are those households who live with an annual disposable 
income of less than US$2 500. This group is excluded from the modernity of our globalised 
societies and has no access to organised financial services. The three largest BOP markets 
(Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa) are home to over 16 million households.52 Given the 
high percentage of the popula tion living on less than US$2 a day, organisations with an 
entrepreneurial mindset and a willingness to invest over the long term and contribute to 
Africa, are more inclined to be successful than those who invest in these countries with a 
short -term financ ial goal.  
The practising strategy box below provides an example of the exploitation of an 
opportunity identified in the remote environment that could develop into a viable business 
idea and profitable organisation.  
121  
PRACTISING ST RATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Practising strategy: The Lightie53 
Approximately 600 million people in Africa and 2 billion worldwide do not have access 
to electricity and are forced to use candles or paraffin lamps to provide light. The 
cumulative burden of these sources of energy in developing countries is enormous:  
1. This costs 2 billion people in developing countries 25 per cent of their income 
for just one hour of light per night - amounting to a total of R380 billion per 
year.  
2. Two million people in developing countries die annually from the use of these 
energy sources.  
3. This 'dirty fuel' releases a total of 190 million tons of carbon dioxide (C0 2) 
pollution into the atmosphere annually.  
In response to this problem, 27 -year-old Michael Suttner inven ted the Lightie,  a solar -
powered lamp that screws into the top of a standard two -litre soda bottle. It provides 
12 times lighter than a paraffin lamp, and uses a long -life lithium battery that will last 
for four to five years.  
At less than US$10 per unit, the Lightie  is a product that will provide an ideal 
energy solution for the BOP market.  
In the bigger context, what is evidently clear is that with increasing globalisation and 
regionalisation, the interconnectedness and interd ependencies between countries are 
increasing and global competition is intensifying. Two phenomena have already created 
seismic shifts in global economic activity:54 
1. The centre of gravity of economic activity is shifting with global business growth 
origina ting from the developing world. The emergence of the BRIC countries 
(Brazil, Russia, India, and China) has already significantly changed global 
competition. These countries are all deemed to be at a similar stage of newly 
advanced economic development. It is estimated that China and India will, by 
2050, become the world’s dominant suppliers of manufactured goods and 
services, respectively. In addition, it is estimated that Brazil and Russia will 
become dominant suppliers of raw material. Due to lower labour  and production 
costs in these countries (now including a fifth nation, South Africa), many 
organisations have cited BRICS as a source of foreign expansion opportunity, in 
other words, becoming promising economies in which to invest.55 The MINT 
nations of Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey, share many of the 
characteristics of the BRICS countries, namely, strong economic growth and the 
potential to provide high returns for investors in these countries over the coming 
decade.56 
2. The economic winners are no t the organisations that control natural resources 
and physical capital, but rather those organisations that have mastered ideas and 
technology - resources that are not bound by ownership or geography, or 
governed by traditional rules of scarcity and scale  economies.  CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
‘Globality’ and reg'ionalisation are creating opportunities as well as threats for developed -
world multi -nationals and new champions from developing countries alike.  
5.3.4 Evaluating  an organisation's strategic response to 
factors in the remote environment  
The list of factors that constitute a remote environment is almost endless. While changes in 
the remote environment may affect a cross -section of industries, some variables are more  
important than others as drivers of change in different industries. Factors are context -
specific and vary from industry to industry, even from organisation to organisation, and can 
be operating at a national, regional or even a global level. Therefore, wh en analysing the 
remote environment, strategists are required to go beyond a mere description of change in 
the environment to an assessment of the forces driving it in order to prioritise these forces 
and thereby enable the organisation to focus its resour ces on the most strategically 
important issues. How organisations respond to these influences can have important 
competitive implications, as well as implications for their long -term survival and 
sustainability.57 
An organisation can buffer itself against threats and take advantage of opportunities 
by firstly identifying and evaluating these influences. A useful tool for summarising and 
evaluating the strategic significance of PESTLE/G factors in the remote environment is the 
External Factor Evaluation (EFE ) Matrix. This tool is illustrated in the practising strategy 
box below by making use of a holiday resort for illustrative purposes.

Notes  
1. Column A lists the most important opportunities and threats originating from the 
remote and market environments. The opportunities and threats are numerous and 
not all are equally important. Key opportunities and threats are those considered to 
be the most strategically relevant to the organisation.  
2. The strategic significance of the key opportunities and threats to the organisation is 
based on priority as determined by the weighted score, indicated in Column B. The 
sum of the weights equals 1.0.  
3. In the example of the holiday resort, the six identified opportunities and threats are 
prioritised, where the priorities are pr ovided in Column E. Priority 1 ( major 
competitor in province ceased operations)  is the factor with the highest priority and 
priority 6 ( technology infrastructure ) is the factor with the lowest priority to the 
organisation. Therefore, the most strategically  significant factors for the 
organisation would be a major competitor in province ceasing operations,  a changing 
customer base,  and new health and safety regulations.  Accordingly, the least 
strategically significant factors would be the number of foreign t ourists growing 8% 
annually, the new water park developed within 4 km, and technology infrastructure.  
4. Column C provides a rating of each of the identified key opportunities and threats, 
indicating how effectively the organisation's current strategies are r esponding to 
the factors, where 1 = response is poor, 2 = response is average, 3 = response is 
above average, and 4 = the response is superior. Bear in mind that ratings are 
organisation -based whereas weights are market -based and that both threats and 
oppo rtunities can attract a 1, 2, 3, or 4 rating.  
124 CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
Column D provides the weighted score, which is determined by multiplying the 
weight in Column B by the rating in Column C, in order to calculate  a weighted score 
for each of the identified opportunities and threats. The sum of the weighted scores of 
all factors is calculated to determine the total weighted score for the organisation. 
Regardless of the number of key opportunities or threats, the hi ghest possible total 
weighted score for an organisation is 4.0 and the lowest possible weighted score is 
1.0. A total weighted score of 4 indicates that the company is responding in an 
outstanding way to the existing opportunities and threats. In the examp le of the 
holiday resort, the weighted score for the company is 2.5 indicating that the 
organisation's strategic response to the key environmental factors is average. The six 
key external factors in this example have been randomly selected for illustrative  
purposes and have not been subjected.  
The EFE Matrix is useful in enabling strategists to visualise and prioritise the opportunities 
and threats that an organisation is facing, and in assessing organisation’s strategic response 
to the identified factors i n the environment and as a whole. It also reveals whether the 
organisation’s current strategy is seizing external opportunities and minimising the 
potential effects of external threats. Such an analysis can inform strategists on how to 
devise alternate str ategies.  
While this section focused on the analysis of the remote environment, the next 
section focuses on the analysis of the market environment.  
LO 4:  Analyse  the market  environment  to identify  threats  and opportunities  facing  
an organisation.  
5.4 Analysing the market environment  
In seeking to devise a strategy, we have to progress from the remote environmental 
analysis to the analysis of the market environment and its constituent stakeholders with 
whom the organisation interacts regularly, as illustrated in Figure 5.2. A good point of 
departure in industry analysis is firstly to understand what an industry is and to 
differentiate between the terms ‘sector’, ‘industry’, and ‘market’. We then move on from 
understanding the industry to developing an understandin g of its attractiveness. Lastly, we 
conclude the chapter by investigating the drivers of change.  
5-4.1 Defining an industry  
A sector  is a group of closely related industries. For example, the computer sector 
comprises the computer component industries (for  example, the disk drive, semi conductor, 
and modem industries), the computer hardware industries (for example the personal 
computer, hand -held computer and mainframe computer industries), and  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTE XT 
the computer software industries (for example, the word processing and spreadsheet 
industries). Industries within a specific sector may connect with one another in many 
different ways. For example, organisations in the computer software industry may provide 
important complements to the computer hardware industries.  
An industry is not merely defined as a market or composed of organisations 
competing with one another. A distinction should be made between the industry and 
organisations it belongs  to and a market that it serves.59 A market is defined as a group of 
customers with similar needs. For example, an organisation could exist in the automobile 
industry, but may choose to compete in the commercial vehicle market. Another example is 
Uber (refer to th e opening case study). As an organisation, Uber exists in the software 
development industiy, but its target market is that of metered taxi operator. An industry is 
therefore defined as a group of organisations offering products and services that are close 
substitutes for one another, ie products or services that satisfy> the same basic customer needs.™  
The basic customer needs that are served by a market define an industry’s boundary. For 
instance, Coca -Cola long saw itself as part of the soda (carbonated s oft drinks) industry, 
whereas it was actually part of the soft drinks industry (which includes non -carbonated soft 
drinks). In the mid -1990s, the rise of customer demand for bottled water and fruit drinks 
began to cut into the demand for sodas, which caugh t Coca -Cola by surprise. Coca -Cola 
moved quickly to respond to these threats by introducing its own brand of water and 
acquired orange juice maker Minute Maid. By defining its industry too narrowly, Coke 
almost missed the rapid rise of non -carbonated soft drinks within the soft drinks market.  
5.4.2  Analysing industry attractiveness61 
According to Michael Porter, customers, suppliers  and competitors  are the primary 
determinants of industry competition. Competitors are comprised of existing competitors  
(incumbent r ivals), potential competitors  (new entrants to the industry) and substitute 
providers  (providers of alternate products and services from other industries). This results in 
five forces that are primarily responsible for industry attractiveness (in terms of both the 
nature of competition in an industry and its profitability). These forces are listed below:  
1. Customers  
2. Suppliers  
3. Existing competitors  
4. Potential competitors  
5. Substitute providers.  
Porter argues that the greater the collective strength of these five forces, the less profitable 
and less attractive the industry is likely to be. Porter’s model of industry stakeholders and 
competitive forces is depicted in Figure 5.3.

Figure 5.3 A model of industry stakeholders and competitive forces?2 
A brief explanation of Porter’s competitive forces is provided below.  
1. Customers (power of buyers). Customers have the ability to dictate prices paid, 
services rendered and/or other contract terms. Some customers exert greater economic 
power than others and have a greater ability to dicta te prices and other contract terms 
as they negotiate with sellers. As a result, powerful customers and buyers may actually 
reduce the profitability levels of industries from which they buy. The power of buyers 
is high under the following conditions: (a) bu yers are few in number and/or have the 
ability to buy in bulk; (b) the product or service being offered is similar to others 
offered, making it easier to switch to alternative suppliers; (c) the value of the buyers’ 
purchases is a significant portion of th e sellers’ total income; and (d) the buyers can 
move backwards into the value chain by acquiring or developing the ability to produce 
the products or services themselves.  
2. Suppliers (power of suppliers). Since suppliers provide all the required inputs to th e 
organisation, including materials, capital and labour, they have the power to influence 
pricing and profitability, reduce quality and/or the availability of products and 
services, thereby creating uncertainty in the buying industry. Supplier power is hig h 
under the following conditions: (a) there are only a few major suppliers and they are 
highly concentrated in relation to the industry they serve; (b) supplies to the industry 
are not similar, making it difficult for incumbents to switch to alternative su ppliers; 
(c) few or no alternative or substitute products or services exist; (d) the suppliers can 
move forward into the  
127 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
value chain by acquiring the ability to use their products and/or  services as inputs to 
the following product and/or service in the value chain; and (e) the value of the 
industry’s purchases represents a small portion of the suppliers’ total income (ie the 
suppliers’ income is derived from serving other or multiple indu stries).  
3. Existing competitors (rivalry among organisations). Competitive rivalry is 
characterised by strategic manoeuvring and retaliatory countermoves on the part of 
industry incumbents. This leads to increased competitive pressure, thereby affecting 
prof itability. The degree of rivalry is dependent on the industry growth rate, as well as 
on the number of players, their relative size and competitive abilities. Competitive 
rivalry is high under the following conditions: (a) there are a large number of rival s 
who are relatively equal in size and power; (b) the industry is growing slower and 
incumbents are vying for the support of existing customers, rather than seeking new 
customers; (c) incumbents carry huge fixed costs; (d) rivals have excess capacity; and 
(e) existing players are unable to exit the industry, either due to the high costs 
associated with ceasing operations or high exit barriers.  
4. Potential competitors (threat of entry). Existing industry players want to retain their 
market share and positions and are wary of new entrants because they can increase the 
level of competition, leading to reduced profits. Organisations therefore create entry 
barriers, which are forces intent on keeping potential competitors out while offering 
protection to existing i ndustry incumbents. There are six barriers to entry, namely:  
i. Capital required to enter the industry  - if capital requirements related to 
manufacturing facilities and equipment, working capital and other start -up costs 
are high, potential entrants will be d eterred.  
ii. Access to distribution of products and/or services  - where difficulty in building a 
network of distributors and/or securing retail shelf space is experienced, 
potential entrants will be deterred.  
iii. Cost disadvantages not related to size - where incumbents enjoy experience, 
relational, technological and learning -based cost advantages that are hard for 
newcomers to replicate and overcome, a barrier to entry will be created.  
vi. Economies of scale  - when the cost advantages derived by incumbe nts due to their 
scale of operations in production, distribution and advertising, afford them cost 
advantages over potential entrants, a barrier to entry will be created.  
v. Government legislation and regulation - where restrictive regulatory policies limit 
or control new entrants by requiring licences and permits to operate in some 
markets such as telecommunications, cable TV and broadcasting, a barrier to 
entry will be created.  
vi. High switching costs  - where customers have a strong brand preference and a high 
degree of loyalty to established brands, making it harder for a newcomer to break 
into the marketplace, a barrier to entry will be created.  
128 CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
5. Substitute providers (of substitute products or services). Organisations providing 
products that serve as replacements for alternatives or substitutes to the products of an 
organisation in a specific industry could be regarded as indirect competitors. For 
example, sucralose contained in artificial sweet eners is a substitute for sucrose in cane 
sugar. Substitute goods and services pose enormous threats to most industries and 
often place a cap on a particular industry’s pricing, thus affecting profitability. 
However, a large part of what constitutes a subs titute is a matter of personal 
judgement. Strategists should be vigilant and closely monitor neighbouring sectors, 
industries and markets for any changes in technology or cost structures. From a 
strategic perspective, substitutes that show improvements in price -performance 
relative to industry averages should be closely scrutinised, especially if produced by 
substitute providers who have huge financial resources.  
6. A sixth force?63 Since the business environment is not static and continuously 
changes, it is e asy to see why the five forces model has come under criticism in recent 
times. One of the most frequent suggestions is that industry regulation is growing and 
should be added as a sixth force, since it regulates market entiy and governs 
competition. There is ample evidence that regulators  or government intervention can 
have a significant impact on industry structure (see the practising strategy box on 
companies guilty of anti -competitive behaviour below). Another contender for the 
sixth force is that of complementors.  Products and services are becoming increasingly 
more complex and a wider range of organisations are involved in making and 
delivering them. Organisations develop relationships, not just with suppliers and 
competitors, but with other organisatio ns whose products enhance their own. For 
example, applications on a smart cellular telephone could be seen as a complementary 
product because customers value their device more with applications than without it. 
Complementors add industry value and also inc rease customer’s willingness to pay for 
products and services.  
The basic steps to follow when using the competitive forces model to analyse industry 
attractiveness are as follows:64 
¦ For each of the identified forces, identify the different parties involved , and the 
specific factors that bring about competitive pressures.  
¦ Evaluate how strong the pressures stemming from each of the forces are (strong, 
moderate to normal, or weak).  
¦ Determine whether the collective strength of the competitive forces (overall), is 
conducive to earning attractive profits in the industry.  
However, for the purposes of strategic analysis, the central challenge is not applying the 
model and assessing the strength of the forces, but in extracting the strategic implications 
for the orga nisation concerned. Strategists should not only consider the influence of the 
forces but should seek out ways of manipulating these forces to the advantage of the 
organisation. An example is demonstrated by the symbiotic relationship between 
McDonald’s and  Coca - Cola, both giants in their respective markets. McDonald’s has 
exclusively stocked and sold Coca -Cola beverages since 1955 and is Coca -Cola’s biggest 
single client. The two companies helped each other grow throughout the globe65. This 
illustrates tha t organisations may  
129 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
alter the nature of competition in their market environment by creating partnerships with 
powerful stakeholders. Finally, the results of such analyses should not only  guide 
organisations in making strategic decisions pertaining to industiy (un)attractiveness and 
(un)profitability, but could also assist in identifying forces relevant to opportunities and 
threats.66 
The practising strategy box below is a news extract tha t provides an example of 
competitive forces in the stolen -vehicle recovery industry in South Africa.  
Practising strategy: Tracking companies 
guilty of anti -competitive behaviour67 
In 2010, the Competition Tribunal found three vehicle -tracking companies and  the 
industry body guilty of anti -competitive behaviour. The tribunal found that Netstar, 
Matrix Vehicle Tracking, and Tracker Network (representing over 90 per cent of the 
industry) and the Vehicle Security Association of SA (Vesa) had contravened the 
Com petition Act by setting standards which created barriers to entry. This prevented 
competitors from entering or expanding in the market and denied consumers the 
benefit of lower prices, greater choice, and technological development. The tribunal 
found the s tandards had an exclusionary effect and were self -serving and irrational.  
This case was brought by both the Competition Commission and the 
complainant and intervenor in the matter, an organisation called Tracetec. Tracetec 
wanted to enter the stolen -vehicl e recovery (SVR) market because it believed that 
radio transmitter technology could be successfully applied in the SVR market. 
However, based on the standards, Tracetec was prevented from being admitted to the 
SVR category.  
Vesa was an industry association  for organisations engaged in the vehicle 
security industry that, at that particular time, had a sub -committee that set standards 
for admission to membership of its SVR category. The tribunal concluded, based on 
evidence, that it was not possible for an or ganisation to expand in the SVR market at 
the time without having its product approved by Vesa in the SVR category. This was 
because all the major short -term insurance companies, represented through their 
industry association, would not approve a customer installing a system that did not 
have Vesa approval. The tribunal also noted, in its reasons, that the South African 
Insurance Industry Association (SAIA), representing all the large insurers and a large 
part of the rest of the industry, who had organised Vesa to set standards for the 
industry, did so, not because of concerns for the consumer, but for its own business 
interests.  
The relief sought by both the commission and Tracetec was limited to a 
declaration that the conduct constituted a prohibited pract ice, ie that the conduct was 
anti-competitive. This declaration would enable a rival organisation to institute civil 
action for damages against the respondents.  
130 CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
5.4.3  Industry drivers of change68 
All industries are affected by new developments and ongoing trends that alter industry 
conditions, some more speedily than others. Many of these changes are important enough 
to require a strategic response. Since the five competitive forces (with the added  sixth 
force) have such significance for an industry’s profit potential, strategists must remain 
alert to the changes most likely to affect the strength of these forces. It is important to 
focus on the most powerful agents of change - those with the bigges t influence in reshaping 
the industry landscape and altering competitive conditions.  
Some of the most common industry drivers of change listed below:  
¦ Changes in the industry’s long -term growth rate. This refers to a situation in 
which a fluctuation in indu stry growth (negative or positive) over an extended 
period affects the supply and demand of an industry’s products or services. This 
change in growth will subsequently influence the potential entry of new 
competitors (if growth is positive), as well as the  exit of existing competitors (if 
growth is negative). The resultant change in the number of industry incumbents 
ultimately influences the degree of competition and the industry’s overall 
attractiveness.  
¦ Changes in demand and customer preferences. In the o pening case study, it was 
mentioned that research indicates that people that never made use of metered 
taxis before, are using Uber. Changes in terms of customer demand and customer 
preference may also occur. For example, cellphone addiction and electronic  
device dependency is a growing trend among students and the youth. Studies 
have highlighted, not only psychological and social health -related issues as 
concerns, but also the major distractions caused by this dependency, often 
leading to motor vehicle acc idents and other related medical emergencies.69 
¦ New business models. The opening case study illustrates a new business model 
that developed in the taxi industry, enabled by technology. Organisations need to 
be aware of new business models in their industri es that affect the way in which 
they do business and which can actually ‘displace’ their existing industry 
entirely. Other examples are cellular technology, digital cameras and video -on-
demand television in their respective industries.  
¦ Product and marketin g innovation. This refers to the implementation of new 
marketing methods involving significant changes in product design or packaging, 
the placement of products, product promotion or product pricing. New marketing 
methods can be applied to new and existing  products, which will attract new 
customers, offer differentiation and new value, thereby altering the nature of 
competition, especially in technology - based industries. Nokia is an example of 
an organisation that defined the mobile telecommunications indu stry at one time. 
Although it was the world leader in the mobile phone market for many years, the 
launching of the iPhone 3G, with its innovative touchscreen and enhanced multi -
media  
131 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
capability, by Apple in 2007, displaced Nokia as the industry leader. Apple’s 
competitive advantage over Nokia was its ability to develop new, innovative 
products that share the same operating system, software and applications. This 
innovation allowed for the speedy introduction of a stream of new products, 
enabling the organisation to stay ahead of its competitors.  
¦ Entry or exit of major organisations. This refers to a situation in which new 
industry players enter the market, or in which a reduction of ind ustry players 
allows for new competition. An example can be found in the South African textile 
and clothing industry. Trade liberalisation during 1995 and 2002 left this industry 
vulnerable to penetration by Chinese and Indian competitors. South African 
organisations were unable to compete against the surge of low -cost substitutes, 
resulting in steady job losses over the following 15 years to the point where 
government intervention was required.  
¦ Changing social concerns of customers. The social concerns of customers may 
change over time. In South Africa, #FeesMustFall is a student - led protest 
movement that began on October 2015 at the University of the Witwatersrand in 
response to an increase in fees at South African universities. The protest soon 
spread to  other South African universities as well and was repeated year after 
year, with various consequences for government and all universities.  
Many more potential drivers of change can be added to the list above. However, the key 
questions are: (i) what factor s are driving industry change;  and (ii) what impact will they have 
on the organisation ? The true analytical task is to evaluate the forces of industiy and 
competitive change carefully enough to separate the major factors from the minor factors. 
Merely iden tifying the drivers of industry change is not sufficient for strategic management 
and planning; a more important step in dynamic industry analysis is to determine whether 
the prevailing change drivers, overall, are acting to make the industry environment m ore or 
less attractive.  
It is important to remember that in practice, industry changes do not follow or mimic 
the pattern of product or service life cycles exactly. A product or service life cycle refers to 
the stages that it goes through from when it was first thought of until it is finally removed 
from the market. (These stages are introduction, growth, maturity and decline). Some 
industries are able to re -invent themselves, one such example is the music recording 
industry illustrated in the strategy prac tice box that follows.  
132 CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
Practising strategy: How the music recording 
industry keeps re -inventing itself70 
1877: First recording of the human voice. While experimenting with a new telegraph 
device, Thomas Edison noticed a speech -like noise as he accidentally ran indented tin 
foil under the telegraph stylus. He went on to invent the first working phonograph 
using a tinfoil cylinder that could both record and playback audio instantly.  
1888: Inv ention of the gramophone. Emile Berliner invented the gramophone using a 
flat 7 -inch disc as the recording medium that could hold up to 2 minutes of recorded 
sound.  
1901: The '78 debuts. Named for its rotational speed of 78 rotations per minute (rpm), 
the ’78 disc, along with the 'Victrola' (the best -selling record player of its time), 
signalled the end of cylinder playback technology. The '78 recording format survived 
well into the 1970s.  
1948: 'Battle of the speeds'. Columbia Records introduced the first 12-inch, (33V 3 
rpm) micro -groove long -playing vinyl called the LP, but RCA Records retaliated with 
its own format, a 7 -inch disc called the 7 -single that went on to become the standard 
for the popular jukebox.  
1964: The cassette tape. Although the technolo gy was already invented as early as 
1930, the cassette tape could not penetrate the market because of the Great 
Depression and World War Two. The cassette tape, however, made a commercial 
breakthrough, when Philips introduced its own 30 -minute format of th e tape cartridge 
and allowed other manufacturers to duplicate the specifications. Piracy became an 
issue for the first time in the music recording industry.  
1980: Death of vinyl. Philips and Sony co -operated to come up with a uniform 
standard for a compact  disc (CD) in 1978. In 1988, the CD surpassed the LP in sales 
and the 80s became the most explosive boom period in recorded audio history as 
consumers replaced their vinyl collections.  
1990: Birth of the MP3. Advances in computing technology during the 1980s 
introduced the combination of MP3 digital audio invention and the Internet. The MP3 
compressed digital audio file size by a factor of 12, allowing digital transmission 
from computer to computer without compromising quality. Subsequently, in 1999, 
Napster introduced its online portal, marking the removal of geographical restriction 
on the publication and distribution of recorded music. Since there is no longer a 
tangible product separating production, publication and distribution, intellectual 
property  ownership became the issue and still remains an issue in the industry.  
133 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
2003: iTunes. Following tough negotiations with music record executives, Steve Jobs 
of Apple Computer subsequently  launched iTunes that allows customers selective 
purchasing of the tracks they love. iTunes went on to become the most successful 
online music store to date. In its first year, Apple sold 70 million songs at US$0.99 
per song, creating nearly US$70 million in legal Internet music sales, thus leading the 
way for online music and media e -commerce. New generation music recording 
includes music streaming platforms for cellular phones such as Apple Music and 
Google Play.  
The time span involved in industry change varies significantly from industry to industiy. 
Furthermore, some industries, such as the motor vehicle industry, stay in the maturity phase 
if their products become basic necessities of life. Other industries skip the mature stage and 
go straight into dec line. The real pay -off for strategising comes when strategists draw some 
conclusions about what strategy adjustments will be needed to deal with the impacts of the 
changes in industry conditions. Therefore, a dynamic industry perspective is not to be taken  
lightly. It has practical value and is fundamental to the task of identifying potential 
opportunities and threats, and thinking strategically about where the industry is headed and 
how to prepare for the changes ahead. The last section in this chapter foc uses on strategic 
responses to changes in the external environment of organisations.  
LO 5:  Discuss  strategic  responses  to changes  in the external environment.  
5.5 Strategic responses to changes in the external 
environment  
It is essential for strategists and organisations operating in an unpredictable world to be 
able to respond quickly to changing circumstances and to alter their strategies accordingly. 
The dramatic rise of Google with its new business model is a good example.71 Google’s 
business model is bas ed on revenues earned from advertising links associated with search 
results, the so -called pay -per-click (PPC) business model. PPC is also known as paid 
search, which refers to an Internet search result that provides links to content. If these links 
are cl icked on, a cost is paid to the advertiser. In response to search requests, search 
engines display PPC ads in the space allocated to advertising on the page displaying the 
search results. When introduced, the impact was disruptive to the business models of  other 
companies that made money from online advertising. Companies like Yahoo.com and 
Microsoft’s MSN network with strong online advertising had to rapidly change their 
strategies to adapt to the threat Google posed. Few people had seen this development 
coming and therefore could not plan for it. Nevertheless, companies had to respond to it, 
and rapidly.  
In the section that follows, the limitations of the process approach to strategic 
management will be explained, followed by a discussion of the concepts o f strategic agility 
and ambidexterity as mechanisms for responding to changes from the external environment.  
134 CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
5.5.1  Limitations of the process perspective of strategic 
management  
In Chapter 3, the process perspective of strategic management was explained as a 
traditional view that comprises distinct stages or phases (ie strategic planning, 
implementation and control), which incorporates a linear view. This perspective rests on an 
implicit assumption  that an organisation’s strategies need only be reviewed during the 
strategic planning exercise.72 However, according to critics of formal planning systems, a 
flexible approach to strategy making is not possible within such a framework. The 
argument is tha t we live in a world in which small change events can have a large and 
unpredictable impact on outcomes. In such circumstances, even the most carefully thought 
out strategic plans are prone to being rendered useless by rapid unforeseen change. 
Therefore, t oday's successful organisations cannot afford to stand still and rest on previous 
accomplishments. If they do, they can easily become vulnerable to a competitor’s new 
product, shifts in customer preferences or other changes in the environment. Instead, the y 
should focus on building sustainable competitive advantage for the future by seeking out 
new ways to remain flexible, innovative, efficient and responsive. Strategic agility and 
strategic ambidexterity became more important than ever. These two concepts are 
explained below.  
5.5.2  Strategic agility  
Strategic agility can be defined as the ability of organisations to stay competitive in their 
industiy and markets, by adjusting and adapting to new ideas and using these ideas to 
create new products and services, as well as new business models.73 Organisations, like 
organisms, must be ‘adept at adapting’ or they will not survive.74 While the formal 
processes and structures of organisations are designed to control people, resources, 
decisions and actions, successful ag ile organisations do not follow these rigid models. 
They are effective at managing change, continuously adapting their organisational 
bureaucracies, systems, products and cultures to survive the shocks and to prosper from the 
forces that often decimate the  competition. Agility  (quickness, responsiveness, the ability to 
adapt to changing demands) is therefore more vital than ever to an organisation’s survival. 
Every organisation exists in an environment and interacts with it to some degree. 
Strategists and o rganisations have a number of options they can follow in order to respond 
to the external environment. These include:75 
¦ Adapting to the environment. This refers to organisational change in response to 
a significant environmental factor or variable through a process of corresponding 
adaptation. There is usually a time lag involved, but if the organisation fails to 
adapt to the change in the environment, it will gradually become irrelevant or 
even extinct. The South African Post Office is an example of an org anisation that 
failed to keep pace with the development and proliferation of the Internet and 
smartphone usage. As such, it could not offer its digital customers a digital post 
or email solution and therefore failed to stay relevant to its customers. An 
example of an organisation  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFR CAN CONTEXT  
that managed to adapt to the South African economic environment is First 
National Bank (FNB). It was estimated in 2017 that there were over 820,000 
stokvels  in the c ountry with a combined membership of 11.4 million people, 
handling over R44 billion per annum.76 FNB was the first to introduce a stokvel 
account aimed specifically at savings as a group.77 Other banks such as Nedbank 
also entered the stokvel market after FNB.  
¦ Influencing the environment. This refers to an organisation (as one of many 
competitive players in its respective market) that proactively changes the 
environment through the leveraging of technology or leveraging of its business 
model, creating new v alue for the market, thereby wrong -footing competitors and 
often making the opposition redundant. Organisations such as Uber (referred to in 
the opening case study to this chapter) and Napster (explained in the reinvention 
of the recording music industry p ractising strategy box) are examples of 
organisations that actively influence the dynamics and nature of competition in 
their market environments. While it is a very rare occurrence for organisations to 
influence even the remote environment, it is possible . Intel Corporation, for 
example, through research and development, invented the Intel 4004 micro -
processor or computer chip in 1971. This revolutionary micro -processor (the size 
of a little fingernail and slimmer than human hair) delivered the same comput ing 
power as the first electronic computer built in 1946 (which filled an entire 
room).78 Computer engineers could purchase this ‘building block’ and then 
customise it with software to perform different functions in a wide variety of 
electronic devices. Th is first general -purpose programmable processor is an 
example of a technological force stemming from the remote environment that 
ushered in the era of integrated electronics in all technology -based industries.  
¦ Selecting a new environment. This refers to an  organisation that decides to divest 
or exit a market because of industry unattractiveness due to high levels of 
competition and low -profit potential and/or that selects a different or new market 
that is more attractive with greater profit potential. Examp les of South African 
companies for whom this response has worked are Woolworths and Mr Price. 
Woolworths was initially known for selling homeware and clothing, but has been 
very successful as a food and grocery outlet. Mr Price’s initial offering was 
fashi on apparel. However, the organisation has since successfully moved into 
sporting apparel and homewares such as textiles and furniture.  
5.5.3  Strategic ambidexterity  
Early in the development of the strategic management field, the external environment was 
considered the primary determinant of which strategies would likely be successful.79 This 
idea of environmental determinism  suggested that good management is associated with 
determining which strategy will best fit environmental forces at a particular poin t in time, 
and then executing it. From a deterministic  perspective, the  
136 CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
most successful organisation will be the one that best adapts to existing forces in the 
external environment (adapters ). However, environmental determinism is no longer accepted 
as an absolute or the primary guide for crafting strategies. The notion of adaptation has 
been supplemented by the principle of enactment, which assumes that organisations do not 
have to submit to  existing forces in the environment and can, to a certain extent, actively 
shape their environments through strategic actions [shapers). In reality, the most successful 
organisations will not opt for adaptation or enactment. They will engage in processes o f 
adaptation and enactment simultaneously.  
Strategic ambidexterity can be defined as the ability to exploit existing 
competencies while simultaneously exploring new opportunities in the organisational 
environment. Stated differently, it involves a balance between explorations and exploitation 
- and so achieves the ‘best of both worlds’. Strategic ambidexterity will position the 
organisation, giving it the ability to influence those parts of the environment over which it 
can exercise some control, while adap ting to environmental circumstances that are beyond 
control or too costly to influence.  
Animals have used this mechanism for millions of years to forage for food 
effectively, and they must consider the same essential trade -off that companies do, and this 
is whether or not to exploit  the current environment or to go beyond the current environm ent 
and explore  the unknown.  
Giraffes, for example, employ clear and distinct approaches for balancing this trade -
off. When food is abundant, as it usually is in the wet season, they don’t need a targeted 
strategy - there’s plenty of low -hanging fruit. In the dry season, giraffes need, on the one 
hand, an explicit strategy for how frequently and how far away they should search for food 
sources, since staying too long at one grove will reduce yield and leave them too hungry to 
find the next food source. On t he other hand, spending too much time wandering around 
looking for food will also make them vulnerable to starvation. Businesses, too, need to 
balance exploiting and renewing their advantage, especially when their current source of 
advantage is threatened by changes, such as technological, social, economic, cultural, 
political, environmental, competitive or natural changes. ‘Low -hanging fruit’ for businesses 
is scarcer than ever, and they need deliberate approaches to achieving ambidexterity.80 
************ ************************  
The big picture  
When considering the context of strategy, a profound understanding of the business 
environment is a prerequisite for successfully managing and practising strategy. This is 
particularly important when viewing strateg ic decision -making at domestic, regional and 
African contexts. In order for organisations to survive, strategists need to know how to 
assess the market and remote environments in relation to key stakeholders and, more 
specifically, to identify and evaluate  the extent to which key factors provide an opportunity 
or a threat for the organisation concerned.  
137 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
However, the main objective of external environmental analysis is not only to determine 
opportunities and threats, but also to provide strategists with an understanding of the 
strategic context and a solid foundation for decision -making and planning. A maj or 
shortcoming is often the inability to move beyond mere accurate identification  and 
description  of forces driving change. What is required, is an appropriate interpretation and 
assessment of what important strategic and competitive implications these for ces hold for 
organisations charting a future direction.  
Summary of learning outcomes  
LO 1: Explain the external environment in the context of strategic 
management.  
Organisations are open systems that are influenced by the environment in which they 
operate.  The environment consists of the micro - (or internal) environment, and the macro - 
(or external) environment, where the latter consists of the market and remote environments. 
Variables in the micro -environment are organisational functions, policies, strateg ies, goals 
and resources. Variables in the market environment are customers, competitors, the labour 
market and labour unions, intermediaries and suppliers. Sub -environments of the remote 
environment are the political, economic, socio -cultural, technologic al, legal, environment 
(natural) and global environments. Two levels of analysis of the macro -environment, that 
will influence the organisation’s strategic direction and strategic actions, can be identified, 
as (i) an analysis of the remote environment; an d (ii) an analysis of the market 
environment.  
LO 2: Explain the importance of strategic context in strategic planning 
and decision -making.  
For strategic planning and decision -making to be effective, it is important to identify 
opportunities and threats in the external environment, as well as strengths and weaknesses 
in the internal environment. Strategists should take advantage of inherent or internal 
strengths and the identified opportunities arising from the external environment; overcome 
inherent weaknes ses, or neutralise identified threats found in the external environment; to 
ensure the strategic ‘fit’ or consistency between the opportunities and threats in the internal 
environment.  
LO 3: Analyse the remote environment to identify opportunities and thre ats 
facing an organisation.  
The analysis of the remote environment firstly involves the identification of remote 
environmental forces. The most important elements of this environment are the political, 
economic, socio -cultural, technological, legal, enviro nmental and global factors 
(PESTL/G). For South African business organisations, it is important to also analyse the 
remote environment in an African and regional context. Lastly, strategists also need to 
evaluate an organisation’s strategic response to fac tors in the remote environment. The 
external Factor Evaluation Matrix is one of the tools that can be used for this purpose.  
138 CHAPTER 5: THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OF STRATEGY  
LO 4: Analyse the market environment to identify threats and 
opportunities facing an organisation.  
The terms ‘sector’, ‘market’ and ‘industry’ are differentiated. A sector is a group of closely 
related industries. A market is a group of customers with similar needs, while an industry 
is a group of organisations offe ring products and services that are close substitutes for one 
another. Various forces are responsible for the attractiveness of an industry (in terms of 
competition in an industry and the profitability of the industry), namely, customers, 
suppliers, existi ng competitors, potential competitors, substitute providers, industry 
regulation and complementors.  
LO 5: Discuss strategic responses to changes in the external 
environment.  
Organisations should be able to respond quickly to a constantly and rapidly changi ng 
environment and alter their strategies accordingly. Strategic agility and strategic 
ambidexterity are two important abilities in this regard, where strategic agility is defined 
as the ability of organisations to stay competitive in their industry and ma rkets, by 
adjusting and adapting to new ideas and using these ideas to create new products and 
services, as well as new business models. Strategic ambidexterity can be defined as the 
ability to exploit existing competencies while simultaneously exploring n ew opportunities 
in the organisational environment.

Knowledge; explicit  ¦ Value chain  
knowledge; tacit  
knowledge  Strategy is the link between the organisation and its environment. 
This means that there should be consistency between the external 
environment of the organisation (including the market an d remote 
environments) with its opportunities and threats, and its internal 
environment (including its mission, goals, values, resources, 
capabilities, structure and systems) with its strengths and 
weaknesses.1 
Matching resources and capabilities within th e organisation, 
with opportunities in the external environment is essential for 
successful strategy. Resources and capabilities have been identified 
as the primary source of competitive advantage and also as a basis for 
the formulation of a strategy for an  organisation. Resources and 
capabilities enable organisations to differentiate themselves from 
competitors and develop strategies from which they can benefit.  
In this chapter, the focus is on the role of the organisation's 
resources and capabilities in th e development and implementation of 
strategy to achieve the goals of the organisation. First, we 
differentiate between resources, capabilities and core competencies 
and focus on their importance in strategic management. Second, we 
focus on appraising the v alue of resources and capabilities addressed, 
and then on the resource -based view relating to internal 
environmental analysis. Subsequently, we identify the capabilities 
and core competencies for creating value in line with the functional 
area and value ch ain analyses. Then, the contribution of resources, 
capabilities and core competencies towards the competitive advantage 
and sustainable competitive advantage of organisations are addressed. 
Lastly, the importance of capturing the value generated by resourc es, 
capabilities and core competencies is addressed.  
Figure 6.1 demonstrates the focus of this chapter within the 
broader context of strategic management. This figure also 
demonstrates the uniqueness of strategic resources and capabilities, in 
the sense that they underpin both strategy formation and 
organisational architecture. They form part of the internal context of 
organisations, because organisations need to understand their 
strategic resources and capabilities and their strengths and 
weaknesses in t his regard.  
Current development and/or the development of new resources 
and capabilities can also be the content of strategic decisions. For 
example, in the Discovery Bank case study, Discovery used its 
strategic resources (such as the Vitality customer ba se) and 
capabilities for innovation and managing financial services 
organisations as a basis for entering the retail banking industry. They 
are also a vital part of organisational architecture, and have to be 
aligned, not only to the strategy, but also to other components of the 
organisational architecture, such as leadership. They also need to be 
aligned with the needs of key stakeholders.   
In the opening case study, Adrian Gore explains how Discovery's 
ability to create un ique new value propositions for customers will be 
brought to bear on the banking sector.

Case study  
Discovery Bank2 
Discovery, one of South Africa's leading insurance companies, is entering the retail 
banking market with Discovery Bank in 2018. Discovery built its success on its leading 
medical insurance business, Discovery Health, and its highly successful Discovery Vitality 
loyalty programme.  
Discovery has been working on its bank for two years, and according to CEO Adrian 
Gore, it has made good progress. They now have a strong team of people on the project and 
the company is already interacting in the payment space. Discovery Bank is being built 
from the ground up, and around R1.5 billion has already been invested in the project to 
ensure that the best platform to serve customers is built, without taking any short cuts. The 
value proposition itself will be good for customers. I mean, that is what we do,' said Gore.  
Discovery Bank will essentially target the same market as its health and insurance 
businesses, namely, the 'mass affluent market' in South Africa. As the y had shown with the 
Vitality programme, using incentives to change behaviour where people are often irrational 
works well, and Discovery feels that they can add value with their model of sharing value 
and creating behavioural change. What Discovery brings  to the banking industry is the 
ability to innovate and a lot of experience in disrupting other industries - they were, after  
147 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
all, the company that revolutionised health insurance in Sou th Africa - and millions of loyal 
Vitality customers. What they do not have is extensive experience of operating a bank 
successfully, and only time will tell if they are able to master this requirement to compete 
successfully in the very competitive South African banking industry.  
LO 1:  Explain  the importance of resources, capabilities and core competencies in  
strategic management.  
6.1 The importance of resources, capabilities and 
core competencies in strategic management  
6.1.1  Resources  
Resources are the productive assets owned by organisations3 used to transform inputs to 
marketable outputs (you may also refer to Chapter 1, Section 1.2.1, where resources were 
first introduced). Resources can be grouped into five primary categories:  
1. Financial resources. Financial resources refer to any economic resource that an 
organisation has, measured in terms of the money utilised in the organisation to 
buy what is needed to offer products and/or services to the market. An 
organisation can generate financial resources internall y from own funds or 
externally from third parties (or non -owners) such as banks, financial institutions 
and creditors.  
2. Physical resources. Physical resources refer to an input in the production process, 
for example, operational and manufacturing equipment,  raw materials and 
components.  
3. Human resources. Human resources refer to the skills, knowledge and experience 
possessed by an individual or group of individuals, which is viewed in terms of 
their value to the organisation. Human resources also include aspe cts such as 
employee insight, intellect, relationships, training and judgement.  
4. Organisational resources. Organisational resources are often referred to as the 
prime intangible asset of an organisation. It relates to resources such as patents, 
brands and h uman capital, that are used to transform inputs to marketable outputs 
and be productive. Organisational resources also include the reporting structure 
and management, including planning, co -ordinating, controlling and networks in 
organisations.  
5. Technologic al resources. The technological resources of an organisation can be 
the sum of two components, namely, the tangible component (which includes the 
active part of the organisation’s tangible fixed assets such as computers and 
information technology systems) and the intangible component (which includes 
intangible assets related to intellectual properties, accumulated skills and 
experience, software licences and patents).  
148  
CHAPTER 6: STRATEGIC RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES  
Resources can be used as a basis for the formulation and implementation of strategies, but 
not all are strategically relevant. Some have little or even a negative impact on the 
performance of an organisation. Resources that can contribute positively to an 
organisation’s  strategy and lead to sustained competitive advantage need to be identified.  
Although resources of organisations in the same industry are typically similar, 
organisations themselves are never identical. They will therefore possess some resources 
that are d ifferentiating, valuable, rare and inimitable (cannot be imitated) and will 
accordingly pursue different strategies and achieve different levels of success. This 
heterogeneity in resources can be acquired and sustained over a longer period within an 
indust ry as it may not be perfectly mobile across organisations.4 
To determine the resources of an organisation, a comprehensive inventory (according 
to the various categories thereof as explained previously) should be developed. The 
inventory should differentia te between tangible and intangible resources and capabilities, 
and human resources (or tacit knowledge). The practising strategy box below illustrates an 
example of the value of resources and capabilities of Discovery.  
Practising strategy: Discovery Medica l Aid 
Insurance  
Discovery Medical Aid Insurance started as a corporate entrepreneurial venture 
within First National Bank (FNB). This means that it was started as a business within 
a business. Through FNB, resources, including financial, physical, human, 
organisational and technological resources, were available to commercialise a new 
business opportunity identified by the bank. Examples of available resources to 
establish Discovery Medical Aid Insurance were:  
¦ Financial resources:  start -up capital was prov ided, salaries were paid to existing 
and new employees and funds were made available to market the new venture;  
¦ Physical resources:  office space, equipment and infrastructure for those 
involved in setting up the new venture were made available;  
¦ Human resou rces:  existing employees in FNB who had the knowledge, 
experience, training and relationships relevant to the new business and who 
had the necessary experience to appoint the required new employees, were 
made available; organisational resources such as a r elated knowledge and 
experience in the financial services market and a tested management structure 
that was also relevant to the new business;  
¦ Technological resources:  existing technology, such as computers and an 
established information technology system that could be used and adapted 
according to the needs of Discovery Medical Aid, were made available.  
149 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
The resources at the disposal of an organisation can also be categorised as tangible and 
intangible resources.  
Tangible resources  
Tangible resources are physical, observable and quantifiable assets of the organisation and 
include physical things such as equipment, money, structures, the sophistication and 
location of a plant, formal report ing structures, technology used and patents. Tangible 
resources can fall into any of the five categories of resources identified above: financial (ie 
loan capital raised), physical (ie equipment and machinery), human (ie employees), 
organisational (ie bran ds) and technological (ie computers) resources. However, some of 
these resources can also be intangible, for example, intellectual capital as a human resource 
and networks as an organisational resource.  
Intangible resources  
Intangible resources are a subset of an organisation’s strategic resources and can be 
categorised into three types, namely, human resources, innovation resources and 
reputational resources.5 
Kristandl and Bontis define intangible resources as follows:6 
Intangibles are strategic firm  resources that enable an organisation to create 
sustainable value, but are not available to a large number of firms (rarity). 
They lead to potential future benefits which cannot be taken by others 
(appropriability), and are not imitable by competitors, or  substitutable using 
other resources. They are not tradeable or transferable on factor markets 
(immobility) due to corporate control. Because of their intangible nature, they 
are non -physical, non -financial, are not included in financial statements, and 
have a finite life. In order to become an intangible asset included in financial 
statements, these resources need to be clearly linked to a company's products 
and services, identifiable from other resources, and become traceable results of 
past transactions.  
Intangible resources are not so easy to identify, but are usually much more valuable and 
superior to tangible resources. Intangible resources include the reputation of an 
organisation and that of its product, employee know -how, perception of quality, abil ity to 
manage change, ability to innovate, team -working ability and participative management 
style.  
Competitors find it difficult to understand, acquire, substitute and imitate intangible 
resources. Therefore, organisations often rely on intangible resources for their core 
competencies and capabilities. Consequently, more intangible and unobservable resources 
will lead to more sustainable competitive advantage.7 
The three types of intangible resources, (human resources, innovation and 
reputation) are  discussed in more detail below.  
150 CHAPTER 6: STRATEGIC RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES  
1. Human resources. Human resources refer to people that own, manage or work in an 
organisation, that have knowledge, trust and managerial capabilities. Hav ing these 
capabilities can be valuable and even primary contributors to competitive advantage as 
these can contribute to the uniqueness of an organisation.  
2. Innovation resources. Innovation resources include ideas, scientific capabilities and 
the capacity t o innovate. Innovation resources refer to the capacity of an organisation 
to innovate through the acceptance and implementation of new ideas, processes, 
products or services. It involves the ability of an organisation to understand the needs 
of customers a nd develop innovative solutions that will ensure customer satisfaction. 
The practising strategic box, focusing on Discovery Medical Aid Insurance, 
highlighted the fact that Discovery started as a corporate entrepreneurial venture 
within FNB. Corporate entr epreneurs (also referred to as ‘intrapreneurs)’ have the 
vision and ability to develop new ideas and opportunities (in this case, new approach 
to medical aid insurance) within an existing business (in this case, FNB).  
3. Reputational resources. Reputational resources include the brand name, reputation with 
customers, perceptions of product quality and reliability. Corporate reputation can be 
defined as the collective assessments of an organisation’s past actions and the ability 
of the organisation to deliver improving business results to multiple stakeholders over 
time. Financial results, management efficiency and effectiveness, the quality of 
products and services and market competitiveness are examples of factors that can be 
used as criteria for ranking. A g ood corporate reputation is vital for an organisation. 
Organisational reputation and image, as well as brand reputation and image, are 
reputational resources. These resources ensure the credibility, trust and confidence of 
current and future employees, sha reholders, customers, service providers and the 
public in general, within an organisation.  
6.1.2  Capabilities  
Capabilities are the capacity of an organisation to deploy resources for a unique end result. 
Capabilities are organisation -specific clusters of activit ies developed through complex 
interactions between tangible and intangible resources over time and reflect what an 
organisation excels at compared to other organisations. They can also be information -
based.8 
Key characteristics of capabilities are that they are valuable across various products 
and markets, embedded in routines and are tacit. Capabilities are what the organisation can 
do exceptionally well.9 While resources are static and will generally deplete over time, 
capabilities increase with use an d become more valuable. Figure 6.2 illustrates an example 
of how resources combine to become marketing and branding capabilities within an 
organisation.

Figure 6.2 The link between resources and capabilities  
Capabilities can be within business functions, can be linked to technologies or product 
design, can involve the ability of the organisation to manage linkages between elements of 
the value chain or can refer to the capacity of the organisation to deploy resources through 
processes.10 
Capabilities  are ‘high -level routine[s] that, toget her with its implementing input 
flows, confers upon an organization’s management a set of decision options for producing 
significant outputs of a particular type’.11 A capability is reflected in high -level activities 
(routines) that produce important outpu ts of significant value that contribute to the 
organisation’s competitive advantage.  
The practising strategy box below provides an example of an organisation that 
develops and continuously improves its capability to develop strong brands.  
Practising strate gy: Discovery brands  
Discovery is an example of an organisation that develops and continuously improves its 
capability to develop strong brands. This is possible through the combination of 
financial resources (Discovery Medical Aid was initially funded by First National Bank as 
a corporate entrepreneurial venture), human resources (experts in the financial services 
and insurance sector and experts in marketing) and organisational resources 
(knowledge of brand development and management expertise) as the bas es for the 
development of excellent business development, marketing and branding capabilities. 
The first venture was with Discovery Medical Aid, that started in the 1990s and is now 
the best -known brand, as well as the largest and most successful medical a id fund in 
South Africa. This was followed by the Discovery Vitality reward programme that was 
developed for Discovery Medical Aid clients. Discovery Vitality rewards Discovery 
Medical Aid members by encouraging them to exercise regularly, eat well and do 
relevant and regular health checks. Subsequently, Discovery Insure was added to the 
Discovery portfolio and includes Discovery Life Insurance and Discovery Car and Home 
Insurance. Discovery Car Insurance is combined with Discovery Vitality  
152 CHAPTER 6: STRATEGIC RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES  
Drive that is a unique driver behaviour programme that rewards members for driving 
well. Another service developed by Discovery is Discovery Credit Card, a unique credit 
card that gives cardholders access to Discovery Miles rewards. Members earn up to 10 
times the number of kilometres when they shop with Discovery's wide range of in -store 
and online partners.12 
The business development, branding and marketing capabilities improve and 
strengthen with each new service and brand added. It is difficult for competitors to 
imitate (inimitable) Discovery as their capabilities improve continuously and form the 
basis of its competitive advantage in the financial services and related industries.  
Carefully developed capabilities form the basis of competitive advantage and are therefore 
the primary differentiators of organisations from their competitors. Building difficult -to-
imitate capabilities, as seen from the Discovery examples, is of great import ance to an 
organisation as this ensures differentiation.  
6.1.3  Core competencies  
According to Grant and Jordan13 and other authors,14 capabilities or competencies are the 
same thing. However, core competencies (also referred to as distinctive capabilities) are 
those capabilities or competencies that distinguish an organisation from others in an 
industry and form the basis of its competi tive advantage, strategy and performance. In 
Figure 6.3, the link between resources (tangible and intangible), capabilities, core 
competencies, strategy, competitive advantage, value creation and organisational 
performance, is illustrated.  
 
Figure 6.3 The link between resources, capabilities, core competencies, strategy and 
competitive advantage and organisational perform ance15 
153 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Core competencies make a disproportionate contribution to customer value and the 
efficiency of its delivery, and serve as a basis for market entry.16 Core competencies that 
are in ternal strengths of an organisation enable it to capitalise on opportunities that are 
identified in the environment.  
Core competencies involve the combination of various resources and capabilities. 
The development of core competencies usually takes place over a period of time and is a 
process of accumulation and learning how to use a unique combination of resources and 
capabilities. It also often involves communication and an intensive commitment to working 
across organisational boundaries. It can entail t he co -ordination of diverse production skills 
and the integration of multiple streams of technology.  
Their complex co -ordination, integration and harmonisation across production skills, 
technologies and capabilities make core competencies difficult to imit ate. They enable 
access to a variety of markets and significantly contribute to perceived customer benefits 
from products and services.17 Most successful organisations will have only one or two core 
competencies, while many average organisations will have no distinguishing core 
competencies at all. From the Discovery example (see the practising strategy box), we can 
see that their capabilities and core competencies are their strategic priorities, meaning that 
the organisation requires a lot of resources to develop and expand those important strategic 
resources.  
Practising strategy: Discovery's 
core competencies  
Discovery's capabilities to develop new businesses, branding and marketing have 
become so specialised and distinctive that it distinguishes Discovery  from others in the 
insurance and financial services industries. Therefore, new business development, 
branding and marketing are the basis of its competitive advantage and strategy.  
Creating a balanced and attractive spread of businesses  
The range of Disco very businesses is differentiated yet related, ranging from medical 
aid, insurance, reward programmes and banking services. All are based on their core 
competencies of new business development in insurance and financial services and 
rewards programmes, bra nding and marketing. Their next project, Discovery Bank is 
proof that they are continuously looking for new business opportunities.  
Developing strong, relevant brand portfolios that win in the local market  
Discovery developed a variety of brand portfolios that meet different insurance and 
finance needs of the same target market, the mass affluence market. These services are 
complemented by rewards programmes with equally strong brands, ie Vitality linked to 
Discovery Medical Aid and Vitality Drive linked to  Discover Car Insurance.  CHAPTER 6: STRATEGIC RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES  
Through the varied services, Discovery attracts clients that then often also migrate to 
other services. For instance, a Discovery Medical Aid and Vitality member wil l also 
acquire the Discovery Credit Card due to the integrated benefits (ie additional rewards 
and Discovery miles) between the services.  
Constantly raising the profitability of their businesses  
Discovery’s aim is to keep on developing new businesses and to improve their 
operational performance through top -line growth and continuous improvement in 
services and products.  
Our focus now turns to the appraisal of the value of organisational resources and 
capabilities.  
LO 2:  Explain  the appraisal  of the value  of resources  and capabilities.  
6.2 Appraising the value of resources and 
capabilities  
Capabilities and resources have the potential to become core competencies and these core 
competencies can result in competitive advantage, but only if they meet certain condit ions. 
A resource -based framework for the analysis of an organisation will determine the 
resources and capabilities that will result in core competencies.  
For resources and capabilities to become the core competencies, they should be 
valuable (V), rare (R),  inimitable and non -substitutable (I), and exploitable by the 
organisation (0), creating (VRIO). Each of these measures can be used to test the strategic 
value of resources and capabilities and are discussed in more detail below.  
6.2.1  Value (V)  
Valuable (V) res ources imply that the organisation has the ability to transform a resource 
into a product or service at a lower cost or with a higher value to the consumer. 
Capabilities are valuable when they enable an organisation to implement a strategy that 
improves ef ficiency and effectiveness (refer to Chapter 1, Section 1.2.3, where these 
concepts were explained). To be valuable, the capability must increase efficiency by using 
fewer resources to generate maximum outputs, or by using the same resources to generate 
more outputs. For example, an information system could reduce the number of customer 
service agents required or increase the number of calls that the same number of agents can 
answer. To be valuable, the capability must increase the effectiveness of the orga nisation, 
meaning that the organisation should increasingly be ‘doing the right things’ - formulating 
and pursuing appropriate organisational goals. Value is dependent on the type of strategy 
implemented, for example a low -cost PRACTISING  STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
strategy of a specialist South African airline, such as Kulula.com, that offers flights at a 
lower cost than conventional airlines. Thus, Kulula.com attracts more customers, which is 
valuable as this contributes to hig her profitability for the company. Another example is 
value created by a differentiating strategy. For example, the African Pride hotels, the 
luxury hotels in the Protea Group of hotels, generate additional income for the group from 
customers who require s pecialist services and who are prepared to pay for such services. 
African Pride hotels transform a resource into a service (hotel accommodation) with a 
higher value to its customers. An organisation decides on a strategy for a specific business 
unit that w ill add value to the organisation. In business, this value can be a measure such as 
profitability  
6.2.2  Rarity (R)  
A valuable resource and/or capability that an organisation owns that other organisations do 
not have, and that is not generally available in the open market, is considered rare (R). The 
situation that arises when a few organisations have the same resource and/or capability, 
creates competitive parity. This is because organisations can use identical resources to 
implement the same strategies and no organisation.  
6.2.3  Inimitability and non -substitutability (I)  
Inimitable capabilities (1) and core competencies are valuable, unique and complex 
resources, and include intangible resources (such as organisational reputation, networks 
employed, client trust and the intellectual property that an organisation might have) and 
capabilities (such as knowledge, the culture of the organisation, skills and experience)18 
that make it difficult for competitors to copy what an organisation is doing, resulting in 
sustained c ompetitive advantage. If it is easy to copy something valuable that an 
organisation started doing first, its competitors will soon follow, and in the process, erode 
any competitive advantage.  
Imitation by competitors is prevented if:  
¦ they do not understand  the reason for the organisation’s  success.  
¦ they do not have the same unique historical conditions.  
¦ the cause of effectiveness is uncertain due to social complexity (for example, 
trust between the organisation and its stakeholders, teamwork and informal 
relationships such as networks).  
Non -substitutability is also part of the inimitability of resources and capabilities and means
that there are no equivalent resources, duplicates, substitutes  or imitations  
that can be  exploited to implement the same strate gies. The strategic value  of a 
capability or core competency of an organisation increases when it is difficult for 
competitors to substitute it and also when it is difficult for them to identify, discern or 
observe it. Specific knowledge of the organisation and trust relationships are not easily 
observable and therefore difficult to copy.19  
CHAPTER 6: STRATEGIC RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES  
6.2.4  Exploitable by the organisation (0)  
The organisation’s structure and systems (0) shoul d be suitable for a specific competitive 
advantage. If an organisation cannot exploit a resource or capability, it will have little 
value. Managerial awareness, of both the potential competitive advantage and the action 
required to realise it, is essential .20 The practising strategy box below provides an example 
of the importance of an organisation’s structure and systems that should be suitable for a 
specific competitive advantage.  
Practising strategy: The Joule electric car 
runs out of current21 
In 2008, the Joule, an electric car developed in South Africa, was launched with great 
fanfare in Paris. The car, a first for South Africa, was designed by South African -born 
automotive designer Keith Helfet, chief stylist at Jaguar, and it certainly seemed set to 
shake up the motoring world.  
However, the dream was not to be. In 2012, Optimal Energy, the company 
behind the Joule, announced that it was shutting down, with the loss of 60 jobs and 
the R300 million, largely funded by the government through the Industria l 
Development Corporation (IDC) that was invested to develop the vehicle.  
The reason for winding down Optimal Energy was that it could not attract the 
R7 billion required to industrialise the Joule, and the IDC and other investors decided 
against providing  further funding for the project. Efforts to find manufacturing partners 
or facilities had also been fruitless, with Optimal Energy exploring the options of taking 
over the then -defunct Hummer production line at the General Motors plant in Port 
Elizabeth o r joining forces with other manufacturers. Another option was to develop an 
electric bus using the intellectual property developed by Optimal Energy for the Joule.  
While one could argue that the Joule was a good design and idea, the company 
simply could no t meet the requirement of organisation, meaning that it could not 
attract the required funding and manufacturing expertise to commercialise its idea. 
However, the intellectual property is still a valuable resource that could be used to 
generate revenues fo r its owners.  
In the next section, our focus shifts to the analysis of the internal strengths and weaknesses 
of the organisation in terms of its resources. We focus on one specific model that can be 
used for this purpose, namely, the resource -based view.  
157 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
LO 3:  Explain  the resource -based  view of an organisation's  internal  analysis.  
6.3 The resource -based view of internal analysis  
Strategy formulation originally included a market -focused mission statement addressing 
what the organisation was about, its business, the market and needs it served, and its 
customers. In a volatile and ever -changing environment, this external focus became risky 
and in the 1990s, attention shifted towards the int ernal strengths, resources and capabilities 
of organisations.  
The resource -based view (RBV) is a model for analysing the internal strengths and 
weaknesses of the organisation with respect to its resources and linking them to 
opportunities in the external e nvironment. It determines where the organisation can build 
competitive advantage, superior performance and customer value.  
A model of the RBV is presented in Figure 6.4. It indicates an assessment of the 
organisation that starts with a general internal evaluation to determine its strengths, 
specifically as related to the industiy in which it operates. Important considerations for this 
assessment are the following:  
¦ Management’s strategic role and the strategic direction. This should reflect what 
is convey ed in the vision, mission, purpose and values to determine whether the 
organisation is clear about what it wants to achieve and how it wants to achieve 
it. 
¦ Core competencies. Core competencies, as identified, developed and protected by 
management that cont ribute to the competitive advantage of the organisation, 
should be considered.  
¦ Resources. The value, barriers to duplication, inimitability and rarity of the 
tangible and intangible resources of the organisation should be considered.  
¦ Capabilities. The value, barriers to duplication, inimitability and rarity of the 
capabilities of the organisation as determined by the culture of the organisation, 
the knowledge, skills and tacitness of employees and the ownership structure of 
the organisation should be co nsidered.  
¦ Appropriability. This refers to the ability of the organisation to retain the value it 
creates for its own benefit. The organisation also needs to determine who benefits 
from this added value. It needs to ensure the retention of key employees, th e 
inimitability of intangible assets and an ownership structure that reinforces 
inimitability contribute to the core competencies of the organisation.  
¦ Managers. This relates to determining whether the experience, strengths and 
management style are aligned with the strategy of the organisation.  
¦ Business owners and investors. This entails determining whether they are aware 
of and in possession of the resources, capabilities and core competencies required 
for success in their organisation.  
158 CHAPTER 6: STRATEGIC RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES  
¦ Operational issues. Aspects such as sales, assets and location should be 
considered in order to determine whether the management thereof are appropriate 
for the specific organisation.  
¦ Employees. The type an d level of employees should be considered to determine 
whether the employees have the relevant skills, knowledge and experience 
required for the organisation.  
¦ Organisational culture. The culture of the organisation should be considered to 
determine whether  the shared values and beliefs of the people in the organisation 
are conducive to the improved performance of all stakeholders.  
A positive assessment of the organisation (management’s strategic role and core 
competencies) will lead to sustainable competitive advantage that ensures value to the 
client and, subsequently, superior performance in terms of profitability of the organisation, 
sustainability and the attainment of organisational goals.  
Figure 6.4 depicts a model of the resource -based view o f an organisation’s internal 
analysis.  
As mentioned previously, the RBV is a model that is used for analysing the internal 
strengths and weaknesses of the organisation in terms of its resources and linking them to 
opportunities in the external environment.  It determines where the organisation can build 
competitive advantage, superior performance and customer value. Although the RBV is a 
widely accepted and invaluable framework for strategy formulation, some limitations have 
been identified. These limitation s are listed below:  
¦ It has not yet been tested and proven empirically.23 Daellenbach and Rouse 
suggest that an important requirement is that the RBV be measured and analysed 
at the resource level, implying the need for longitudinal studies. A longitudinal 
study is a research design that involves repeated observations of the same 
variables over different points in time. Reviewing and testing of longitudinal data 
will make it possible to measure the performance of an organisation over a period 
of time, with a  start and end date.24 
¦ It does not address how to increase profitability and/or how to  develop  
further competitive advantages or create new ones.25 
¦ The lack of future orientation and the inability to differentiate  between  
valuable and less valuable resources and capabilities result in a lack of 
predictability.26 
The next section focuses on the identification of capabilities and core competencies in an 
organisation.

6.4 The identification of capabilities and core 
competencies to create value  
Through the exploitation of capabilities and core competencies, organisations create 
products and services with value which customers are willing to acquire. Those that are 
superior to what is being offered by competitors contribute to competitive advantage. 
Value is determined by lo wer production cost and/or differentiation between products and 
services of competitors.  
160 CHAPTER 6: STRATEGIC RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES  
The identification and assessment of capabilities and core competencies are challenging but 
essential as it forms the basis of an effective organisational strategy.27 A value - chain 
analysis or a resource -based approach can be used. Both models involve determining the 
strengths and weaknesses of an organisation and how the strengths contribute to  its 
competitive advantage. The performance of an organisation can also be evaluated and 
compared to the performance of competitors.  
Identifying and assessing capabilities and core competencies will enable the 
organisation to determine the following:  
¦ how t he components of its value chain add worth to its performance.  
¦ how resources and capabilities contribute to competitive advantage.  
¦ how good its financial performance is compared to competitors.  
¦ how customers and employees benefit from the organisation’s capabilities and 
core competencies.  
As discussed in the previous section, the resource -based view of strategy focuses on the 
internal environment with analysis of the internal strengths and weaknesses of the 
organisation in terms of its resources and capab ilities and links it with opportunities in the 
external environment. Internal resources and capabilities determine strategic decision -
making as these are key factors that determine the performance of an organisation. The five 
stages of strategy formulation  according to Grant and Jordan28 based on the resource -based 
view of strategy are as follows:  
1. The identification and classification of the organisations' resources.  
2. The identification of the capabilities of the organisation.  
3. Appraisal of the rent-generating potential (the value) of resources and 
capabilities.  
4. The selection of a strategy that optimally exploits the resources and capabilities 
of the organisation relative to the opportunities in the external environment.  
5. The identification of resource gaps, that is the difference in the resources 
available and the resources needed for the organisation’s strategy.  
An organisation’s resources, capabilities and core competencies can be identified, 
classified and analysed either (1) according to it s functional areas, or (2) by means of an 
analysis of its value chain. These two approaches are explained below.  
6.4.1  Classification of capabilities and core competencies  
according to the functional areas of an organisation  
A functional analysis identifies capabilities that can become core competencies of an 
organisation in line with its functional areas. Below, examples in terms of the finance, 
operations, human resources, procurement, research and development, marketing and public 
relations functions are p rovided:  
161 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
¦ Financial function. This chapter’s opening case study on Discovery Bank 
provided an example of a profitable organisation which had access to internally 
generated funds, as well as external funds, due to their reputation for excellent 
performance. Their access to funds enables them to implement research 
initiatives, be innovative and continuously expand the organisation.  
¦ Operations function. Toyota Motor East Japan, Inc. has been at the core of the 
Toyota group, serving as a key base for development and production. It excels in 
its operations function due to its culture and tacit knowledge that cannot be 
imitated by Toyota plants in other countries.  
¦ Human resources function. For si x consecutive years, the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology (MIT), has been rated the world’s top university. At the heart of 
this incredible ranking is their extremely strong reputation among both fellow 
academics and employers, as well as the fact tha t MIT is responsible for an 
impressive number of academic citations per faculty.  
¦ Procurement function. Mr Price Home identifies trends and products that they 
imitate, order and buy directly from producers and wholesalers. Due to this 
procurement capability  of bringing desirable, yet affordable products in high 
volumes to the low - and medium -income mass market, Mr Price Home has a 
competitive advantage in the home and decor market.  
¦ Research and development function. Apple Inc. is an example of a company in 
which research and development in its high -technology products is a core 
competency. Apple’s strategy is to always be ahead of its competitors in new 
products, applications, functions and the look of their Mac computer range, 
iPods, iPhones, iPads, Apple w atch and complementary products and services.  
¦ Marketing function. In the opening case of this chapter, the marketing function of 
Discovery is identified as a core competency. The database of existing customers 
using one service, ie the medical aid, are exp osed to Discovery’s other and new 
services, such as their new hanking services.  
¦ Public relations function. Building relations with strategic markets is, in effect, 
the management of relationships with the public relevant to the organisation. 
Upmarket resta urants are organisations that have developed public relations as a 
core competency. For example, the very successful chef and restauranteur 
Chantel Dartnall whose Mosaic restaurant has twice been named as one of the top 
ten restaurants in the country, pres ent culinary programmes on prominent 
television stations, participates in chef competitions in South Africa and 
internationally, and was named the best female chef in the world in 2017. Besides 
distributing a quarterly newsletter to customers, regular arti cles and snippets 
about Dartnall and the restaurant appear in magazines. She also personally 
presents her menu of the day to all patrons of the restaurant, and even meets and 
greets customers informally in public places. Effective public relations is a cor e 
competency of this organisation.  
162 CHAPTER 6: STRATEGIC RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES  
6.4.2 Classification of capabilities and core competencies 
through value chain analysis  
The main function of an organisation is to add value successfully in the process of 
producing products and/or delivering services. In other words, this means that the main 
activities of an organisation are effectively combined to create customer value. Michael 
Porter developed the value chain, which can be d efined as a set of activities that an 
organisation performs to create value for its customers. These activities are divided into 
five primary and four support categories.29 Figure 6.5 depicts the value chain.  
External environment  
 
Primary activities 
External environment  
Figure 6.5 The value chain30 
As previously stated, capabilities or competencies are the same things. However, core 
competencies (also referred to as distinctive capabilities) are those capabilities or 
competencies that distinguish an organisation from others in an industry and form the basis 
of its competitive advantage, strategy and performance. Thus, capabilities can  become an 
organisation’s core competencies.  
A distinction is made between primary and support activities. Primary activities and 
related capabilities in the value chain include the following:  
¦ Procurement and inbound logistics. These activities relate to r eceiving, storing 
and distributing inputs for the manufacturing of products by the organisation. 
Capabilities:  purchasing, material and inventory control systems.  
163 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
¦ Production/operations. Production/operations activities refer to those activities 
that transform inputs into final products, ie facility operations, machines and 
assembly. Capabilities:  design and product development, quality control, 
component manufacture  and assembly.  
¦ Outbound logistics. Outbound logistics refers to activities related to collecting, 
storing and distributing products and services to customers. Capabilities:  
distribution co -ordination, processes related to warehousing of products and 
dealer  relationships.  
¦ Marketing and sales. These refer to marketing, sales and purchasing of an 
organisation’s products and services. Capabilities:  innovative promotion and 
advertising, and a motivated sales force.  
¦ Customer services. Customer services refers to everything involved in improving 
and maintaining the value of a product for the customer. Capabilities:  parts, 
warranty and servicing arrangements, and the quality and training of employees.  
Support activities in the value chain include the following:31 
¦ Administration and infrastructure. These activities support the entire value chain 
and include general management, planning, financial management, information 
systems, legal issues and quality management. Capabilities: risk management and 
integration of the value chain.  
¦ Human resource management. This involves the appointment, development and 
retention of employees at all levels, their compensation and all matters relating to 
their employment. Capabilities:  training, skills development, staff recruitment and 
retention.  
¦ Procurement. Procurement is also referred to as the purchasing function and 
involves the selection and development of suppliers, sourcing of supplies, 
evaluating price, cost control, paperwork and accounting and inventory control. 
Capabilities:  inventory and database management.  
¦ Technology development. This involves all technology related to the operations 
and management of the organisation. Capabilities:  integrated management 
information systems and technology -managed design and manufacturing.  
The internal environment of the organisation, including the primary and support activities, 
determines an organisation’s strengths and weaknesses. This has to be aligned with the 
opportunities and threats in the external environments (as indicated in Figur e 6.5). 
Therefore, knowledge and understanding of the external environment are essential to 
determine opportunities and threats. The external environments that impact on 
organisations are the market environment and the macro -environment. The market 
environ ment comprises consumer behaviour, needs, purchasing power, suppliers, 
intermediaries and competitors. The macro -environment includes the political, 
technological, physical and international environments, as well as broad economic and 
social issues.  
164 CHAPTER 6: STRATEGIC RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES  
The margin (which is also indicated in Figure 6.5) is the economic value that the 
organisation retains for corporate and operational purposes and includes profits and 
funding other projects , such as research and development projects, corporate social 
responsibility projects, mergers and acquisitions.  
The objective of successful organisations is to build difficult -to-imitate core 
competencies that distinguish an organisation from its competitors. Capabilities and core 
competencies are valuable when they enable an organisation to implement strategies that 
improve efficiency and effectiveness. The type of strategy also determines the value, ie low 
cost or differentiation strategies.  
The following section focuses on the contribution of organisational resources 
towards the competitive advantage and sustainable competitive advantage of organisations.  
LO 5:  Discuss  the contribution  of resources, capabilities and core competencies  
towards the competitive advantage and sustainable competitive advantage of an 
organisation.  
6.5 The contribution of resources, capabilities and 
core competencies towards competitive 
advantage and sustainable competitive 
advantage  
When two or more organisations compete within the same industry, one organisation 
possesses a competitive advantage over its rivals when it performs (or has the potential to 
perform) better than its rivals (refer to Chapter 1, Section 1.8, where the term ‘competitive 
advantage’ was introduced).  Organisations can achieve competitive advantage, in two 
ways:  
1. Differentiation. It can produce products and services that are superior in value to 
those of competitors, and that allows it to charge premium prices or to retain 
customers for a longer period of time. The differentiation approach can be 
focused, meaning, that the organisation can concentrate on offering its products 
or services to a specific segment of a market or niche market. Alternatively, if it 
is a product or service with a wider appeal, i t can target broad segments of a 
market or industry.  
2. Cost leadership. It can produce products or services at a significantly lower cost 
than its competitors (cost leadership), enabling it to leverage higher profit 
margins. The cost leadership strategy can also be aimed at a focused or broader 
market.  
The practising strategy box that follows provides examples of companies achieving 
competitive advantage through various strategies (differentiation and cost -leadership).  
165 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Practising strategy  
Apple: Competitive advantage through a broad differentiating strategy  
As introduced in Section 6.4.1, Apple Inc. is the producer of the Macintosh computer 
and laptop range, iPods, iPhones, and iPads,  Apple watch and complementary products 
and services. The products are also developed to integrate and synchronise with one 
another. Many people who make up Apple’s loyal customer base owns various Apple 
products, such as a Mac Air laptop, an iPhone, an Ap ple watch, an iPad and all the 
complementary products such as smartphone and iPad covers, docking stations, 
various applications such as iTunes and more. The design of Apple products is sleek 
and sophisticated and the Apple brand is a core competence of th e organisation. Apple 
Inc. is an example of a company that is a differentiator, as it spends a lot on research 
and development and charges a premium price for its products. Despite this, Apple 
products have a broad international appeal in the high -income m arket.  
Singita: Competitive advantage through a focused differentiating strategy  
Singita is an example of a focused differentiating strategy, offering a range of exclusive 
game lodges in private African game reserves. Tourists stay at Singita to experience  the 
expansive space and beauty of their reserves. Limited guests paying a premium ensures 
that guests experience exceptional care. These lodges are accessible only to highly 
affluent, mostly international tourists, as the cost per person per night is arou nd 
R24,000 (in 2018). This includes luxury accommodation, all meals and refreshments, 
exclusive safari experiences and other five -star services.  
Mr Price Sport: Competitive advantage through cost leadership  
The establishment of Mr Price Sport has followed Mr Price's success in bringing fashion 
clothing at affordable prices to the mass market in South Africa. Mr Price Sport has 
identified the extensive market for sports clothes and equipment at affordable prices. 
By offering a wide range of good quality spor ts clothes and equipment at unbeatable 
prices, Mr Price Sport has gained a large market share of all income groups, including 
the vast market for children. In many cases, the same producers and suppliers of 
fashion clothing are also able to supply the new venture with sports clothing. Due to its 
large market share, Mr Price is in the position to negotiate excellent prices, often 
directly with producers of clothes and equipment, as well as with international 
wholesalers. The benefit of the low prices paid fo r stock can then be transferred to 
customers to whom pricing is of utmost importance. Mr Price is an example of an 
organisation with a competitive advantage based on a broad cost leadership strategy.  
166 CHAPTER 6: STRATEGIC RESOURCES AND  CAPABILITIES  
Road Lodge Hotels as a focused cost leadership strategy  
As part of the City Lodge Hotel Group, the Road Lodge Hotels offers accommodation at 
very affordable rates to a focused market, namely, the public that want to or have to 
travel, but wit hin a limited budget. Accommodation at these hotels is focused on 
providing low -cost accommodation to those niche markets who want to travel for 
leisure or are entry -level employees who have to travel for work, but have limited funds 
available.  
For differe ntiators, competitive advantage is achieved by combining resources, capabilities 
and core competencies to produce products and services of superior quality. For cost 
leaders, production efficiency is important. Either a differentiating or cost leadership 
strategy can be achieved through different capabilities, as follows:  
¦ The ability to produce high -quality products. Products are perceived as superior 
to those of competitors when they have a high brand value or are more reliable 
and durable.  
¦ The ability to innovate. Innovation involves experimentation and creative 
processes aimed at developing new products, services or processes for 
commercialisation and introduction to the market or potential users. In order to 
innovate, organisations will typically have to  spend more than their competitors 
on research and development. This can involve technological improvements to 
products, services or processes; the design of new products; new marketing 
strategies, or improved administrative and organisational systems and techniques. 
By ensuring uniqueness through innovation and the ownership of patents, 
trademarks or brands that cannot be imitated by competitors, organisations can 
achieve competitive advantage.  
¦ Responsiveness to customers. This is the ability of an organis ation to identify 
and satisfy the needs and wants of customers. To contribute to competitive 
advantage, customer responsiveness should be superior to that of competitors. By 
providing unique and innovative services, organisations may be in a position to 
charge premium prices or to retain customers.  
¦ Efficiency. Efficiency is achieved by using the fewest inputs (raw materials, 
production methods, labour, knowledge, expertise, technology) to generate a 
maximum amount of outputs (products and services produced) . The level of 
efficiency is determined by the quantity of inputs needed to produce output, 
therefore:  
Efficiency = output/input  
An efficient organisation will require less input to produce a desired output. 
Efficiency is often determined by the productivity of the employees of an 
organisation. The ability to produce products or services at a cost significantly 
lower than competitors rests on the ability of the organisation to leverage 
production efficiencies. Production efficiencies can be achiev ed through various 
means, for example:  
167 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
? Economies of scale. Economies of scale is an economics term that describes 
a competitive advantage that large organisations have over smaller ones.  It 
means that the larger the organisation, the lower its costs and such an 
organisation will be able to produce larger quantities of a product at lower 
prices.  
? Economies of learning. A learning economy can be defined as an economy 
in which knowledge is th e crucial resource and learning is the most 
important process. Just like economies of scale, economies of learning will 
enable an organisation to develop a competitive advantage by gaining more 
experience, which will lead to a decrease in production costs.  
? Designing products for more economical production or using new 
technologies to reduce costs. Organisations can gain competitive advantage 
by designing products which require fewer inputs, and which will lead to 
higher levels of efficiency.  
? Reducing unnecessary costs.  
? Leveraging location advantages. Organisations can gain a competitive 
advantage by locating productive assets in areas where the costs are lower.  
Practising strategy  
Differentiating or cost leadership strategy can be achieved through diff erent capabilities:  
¦ The ability to produce high -quality products. Harley -Davidson motorcycles deliver 
high-quality products. There are various Harley -Davidson models, but all have the 
distinctive Harley -Davidson look, sound and branding and are regarded as  status 
symbols in some motorcycle circles. To many, the appeal lies specifically in the 
American heritage of these motorcycles, and customers are willing to pay a 
premium for these symbols to reflect their status as motorcycle connoisseurs. 
There are also  many complementary Harley -Davidson accessories such as jackets, 
helmets and other items that further enhance the experience of belonging to a 
group of people who own products with high brand value.  
¦ The ability to innovate. As explained previously (Section  6.4.1), Apple Inc. has built 
a large loyal customer base by producing innovative products and stylish product 
designs, with the result that from 2013 to 2017, Apple was recognised as the most 
valued brand in the world, with a brand value worth of $184,15 billion in 2018.32 
168 CHAPTER 6: STRATEGIC RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES  
¦ Responsiveness to customers. Discovery Medical Aid's Vitality programme rewards 
members for healthy living. Discovery's unique approach is in identifying rewards 
that are valuable to their customers, ie discounted gym membership, movies, 
national and international flights and hotel accommodation; cash back when 
buying healthy foods; rewards such as smoothies for reaching activity goals and 
many more. By constantly resea rching and identifying what would add value to 
customer experience Discovery responds to their needs, often before customers 
realise their own needs. This capability of Discovery is very difficult, if not 
impossible to imitate, thus inimitable. Therefore, Discovery is a good example of an 
organisation that is responsive to its customers.  
¦ Efficiency. Mr Price is an example of a very efficient organisation. Through its 
network of suppliers and high -volume purchasing, Mr Price offers fashion, sport 
and home go ods at excellent prices at its three extensive specialist store ranges, 
Mr Price Clothing, Mr Price Sport and Mr Price Home. Due to economies of scale, 
goods at Mr Price stores can often be purchased at lower prices than through 
wholesalers that seldom hav e the purchasing capacity of Mr Price. Mr Price 
reduces cost by identifying fashion trends in clothing, interior decor and home 
goods and having it reproduced in large numbers at very good prices.  
An organisation that has the ability to perform (or the pot ential to perform) better than its 
rivals over the long term, has a sustainable competitive advantage (refer to Chapter 1, 
Section 1.8, where we differentiated between competitive advantage, sustainable 
competitive advantage and transient competitive advan tage). Sustainable competitive 
advantage is determined by the durability of the relevant resources, capabilities and core 
competencies and how inimitable they are. Durability  refers to the length of time over which 
a capability is relevant and can contribu te to the competitive advantage of the organisation. 
For example, a strongly ingrained culture is extremely durable and long -lasting, while a 
technical competence is of much shorter duration. Imitability  refers to how easy or difficult 
it is for competitor s to copy the competitive advantage and is determined by transferability 
and how replicable a capability is. Transferability  is how easy or difficult it is to acquire or 
buy a resource. For example, raw materials, components, machines and human resources 
are all easily transferable, while immobile and intangible resources, such as organisational 
culture, are not easy to transfer. The latter is more valuable because it may be specific to 
the organisation or lose worth when transferred. Replicability  refers t o the ability to use the 
resource in other settings. For example, Curro Private schools were established in 1998 as a 
leading independent school provider in southern Africa. It was able to replicate its ability 
to start up and manage more than 100 private schools since its establishment in South 
Africa.  
In the last section of this chapter, our focus turns to capturing the value generated by 
resources, capabilities and core competencies.

LO 6:  Explain  the importance  of capturing  the value  generated  by resources,

6.6 Capturing the value generated by resources, 
capabilities and core competencies  
Even when resources are inherently valuable and comply with the value, rarity, 
inimitability and organisation (VR10) principles explained in Section 6.2, it does not 
necessarily mean that the organisation will have the capacity to take advantage of them, n or 
benefit from them. If the organisation cannot capture sufficient value to justify its 
investment in developing unique resources and capabilities, it will not be able to achieve 
competitive advantage. This is known as appropriability.  
As explained in Sec tion 6.1.2, dynamic capabilities are strategic in nature and are 
those capabilities that help organisations to learn new capabilities that enable them to adapt 
to environmental changes. Dynamic capabilities involve the ability to integrate, build and 
recon figure internal and external processes and competencies to address a rapidly changing 
environment. It is the ability to adapt capabilities that is the ultimate basis of sustainable 
competitive advantage.  
Resources and capabilities are valuable when they en able organisations to deliver 
products and services to customers at a price they are willing to pay. The value of 
resources and capabilities is indirectly determined by the following:  
¦ the external environment, including demand and the potential of the mark et. 
¦ changes in the external environment, for example, changes in technology, the 
structure of an industry and preferences of customers.  
¦ differences between the resources utilised by different organisations.  
¦ value as determined by either lower production cost than rivals or increased 
revenues, or a combination of the two.  
Although competitive advantage is important to an organisation, on its own it does not 
necessarily lead to superior organisational performance. For resources and capabilities to 
be the ba sis of competitive advantage, as well as ensuring superior profitability, the 
following are important:  
¦ The resources and capabilities should be inherently valuable, as determined by 
the VRI0 framework.  
¦ The resources and capabilities should enable the organisation to address market 
segments that are large enough (L) to allow the organisation to generate 
sufficient financial returns.  
¦ The resources and capabilities should enable the organisation to identify and 
address an unmet (U) needs of customers. Unm et needs are defined as those 
needs of customers that are high in importance and insufficiently satisfied.33 
170 CHAPTER 6: STRATEGIC RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES  
These additions extend the VRIO framework of resources and capabilities to VR IOLU. The 
extended framework involves the evaluation of resources and capabilities along three 
important dimensions:54 
1. From the organisational perspective, it evaluates the value (V) to the organisation 
and the ability of the organisation (0) to exploit th e resources and capabilities.  
2. From the perspective of competitiveness, it considers the rareness (R) and 
inimitability (I) and the availability of resources and capabilities to competitors.  
3. From the perspective of customers, it evaluates the size of the market and 
determines whether it is large (L) enough to cover the fixed costs of the 
organisation. It also evaluates the extent to which resources and capabilities 
allow the organisation to address unmet (U) customer needs.  
The development of capabilities is highly dependent on human beings and their store of 
knowledge. As Robert Grant explains, organisational capability is a function of knowledge 
integration.35 In other words, competitive advantage begins with individual knowledge, but 
individual knowledge  on its own is not worth very much. It is really in the extent to which 
it is shared, assimilated and transformed that its true value will be realised, and this will 
ultimately determine the development of capabilities and core competencies. For that 
reaso n, this section should be read in conjunction with Chapter 9, which explores the 
learning organisation, and the individual and organisational learning process.  
************************************  
The big picture  
In this chapter, we introduced four key con cepts. First, we explored the idea of strategic 
resources, as the tangible and intangible assets of the organisation. On their own, resources 
are valuable, but will reduce in value over time. It is only when resources are combined to 
develop capabilities t hat they become a revenue -generating asset. Unlike resources, 
capabilities will become more valuable with use and over time, they will lead to the 
generation and accumulation of more resources.  
We also explored the importance of dynamic capabilities, those  capabilities that 
allow the organisation to sense opportunities for renewing itself and developing new 
capabilities.  
Core competencies (also known as distinctive capabilities) are the few very 
important capabilities that the organisation does differently and better than its competitors 
and provides the organisation with a competitive advantage.  
In the resource -based view, history matters, and the more resources an organisation 
begins with, the more likely it is to succeed and to add to its resources, incre asing the 
foundations of its success. For this reason, it is important for organisations to think about 
their strengths and weaknesses in terms of resources and capabilities, and to find ways of 
developing dynamic capabilities.  
171 PRACTI SING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Summary of learning outcomes  
LO 1: Explain the importance of resources, capabilities and core competencies 
in strategic management.  
Resources are the productive assets owned by organisations. Resources are grouped into 
five primary categories, namely, financial, physical, human, organisational, and 
technological resources. Resources at the disposal of an organisation can also be tangible or 
intangible. Capabilities are the capacity of an organisation to deploy resou rces for a unique 
result. Core competencies are those capabilities that distinguish an organisation from others 
in that industry and form the basis of its competitive advantage, strategy and performance.  
LO 2: Explain the appraisal of the value of resource s and capabilities.  
Capabilities and resources have the potential to become core competencies and these core 
competencies can result in competitive advantage, but only if they meet certain conditions. 
A resource -based framework for analysis of an organisation can be used to determine the 
resources and capabilities that will result in core competencies. For resources and 
capabilities to become core competencies, they should be valuable, rare, inimitable and 
non-substitutable, and exploitable by the organisation.  
LO 3: Explain the resource -based view of internal analysis.  
The resource -based view (RBV) model for analysing the internal strengths and weaknesses 
of the organisation in terms of its resources and linking them to opportunities in the 
externa l environment was elucidated. The RBV determines where the organisation can build 
competitive advantage, superior performance and customer value.  
LO 4: Explain the identification of resources, capabilities and core 
competencies to create value according to  the functional area and 
value chain analysis.  
An organisation’s resources, capabilities and core competencies are identified, classified 
and analysed according to its functional areas, or through an analysis of its value chain.  
LO 5: Discuss the contribut ion of resources, capabilities and core competencies 
towards competitive advantage and sustainable competitive advantage 
of an organisation.  
This learning objective explained how organisations achieve competitive advantage over 
competitors through differen tiation or cost leadership based on their resources, capabilities 
and core competencies.  
172 CHAPTER 6: STRATEGIC RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES  
LO 6: Explain the importance of capturing the value generated by resources, 
capabilities and core  competencies.  
Appropriability or the ability of the organisation to capture sufficient value to  
justify its investment in developing unique resources and capabilities, to ensure the  
achievement of competitive advantage, is explained.

ORIENTATIO
N After reading this chapter, you should be able to:  
LO 1: Understand the nature and use of strategic goals and strategic 
choices in providing strategic direction.  
LO 2: Differentiate between various corporate -level strategies that 
create corporate value and synergy.  
LO 3: Discuss the management of the multi -business organisation.  
LO 4: Differentiate between the various business -level strategies for 
creating and sustaining competitive advantage.  
LO 5: Explain the evaluation of strategic choices.  
¦ Acceptability  ¦ Feasibility  
¦ Cooperative strategy  ¦ Internal growth strategy  
¦ Cost leadership strategy  ¦ Strategic business units  
¦ Differentiation strategy  ¦ Suitability  
¦ External growth strategy  ¦ Turnaround strategy  
Becoming a leading multi -national group starts with one strategic 
decision. In the case of Bidvest,  it was through buying businesses that 
others were eager to sell, followed by a process to turn under -
performing operations around. On the surface, this process seems 
quite basic, but success only follows well -considered strategic choices 
in anticipation o r response to market conditions. Good strategic 
decisions follow a clear strategic direction, insight to the external 
environment (as explained in Chapter 5), understanding of the 
organisations' own strengths and weaknesses (as explained in Chapter 
6), as well as the ability to anticipate and respond to customers' needs.  
This chapter deals with developing and choosing appropriate 
strategies. First, the nature and use of strategic goals and strategic 
choices to provide strategic direction to an organisation are  
explained. Second, we differentiate between the various corporate - 
level strategies, and follow this with a discussion of the management 
of multi -business organisations. Third, we differentiate between the 
various b usiness -level strategic options. Lastly, we explain the 
evaluation of strategic choices. Figure 7.1 illustrates how to develop 
and choose appropriate strategies in the context of this book.

Bidvest: From humble beginnings to a leading multi -national group1-2 3 
The JSE -listed Bidvest Group is one of the leading corporations in South Africa with a 
turnover of over R70.1 billion, employing more than 130,000 people.4 Brian Joffe launched 
the organisation in 19 88. Joffe built the organisation by buying businesses that others were 
eager to sell. He followed a uniquely empowered business model driven by autonomous 
entrepreneurs, each responsible for growing their own operations. Following the acquisition 
by Bidves t, under -performing operations were often transformed into industry leaders. 
Rather than focus on one market, the group offers a diverse range of products and services 
across industries. Key corporate strategies, since the inception of the organisation, ar e listed 
in Table 7.1:5

180 CHAPTER 7: DEVELOPING AND CHOOSING APPROPRIATE STRATEGIES  
The Bidvest Group strategy focuses on strategic diversification, across industries and 
geographies. This strategy creates built -in stability, for example, when the South African 
economy faces challenges and the Rand comes under pressure, offshore businesses 
generally provide a strong counterweight. Representation across numerous industries 
ensures that a degree of growth is achieved overall, even in difficul t trading conditions.  
The first step that Bidvest follows when implementing the strategy, is to identify an 
underperforming organisation, to acquire such an organisation and to turn its performance 
around by the redefinition of the market and expansion int o related areas. For example, in 
1995, Bidvest acquired Manetta Australia (now Bidvest Australia). In the first two years 
following the acquisition, Bidvest made a loss of AU$6m. Flowever, after the two years, the 
company contributed to the organisation's profit. Once an organisation has been acquired, it 
is followed by the redefinition of the market and expansion into related areas. For example, 
Walton's, a stationery supplier, created an entry -point into the business retail industry 
(supplying stationery to businesses). However, the market was widened by adding office 
furniture and office technology.  
The organisation is of the opinion that critical mass enables greater efficiency that 
drives further growth and helps secure the jobs of employees. In most ca ses, efficiency 
results in less wasted resources and further cost advantages due to scaling. Lower costs can 
either improve margins or enable the organisation to lower selling prices, which in turn could 
increase market share. Reinvention and a wider visio n are critical. For example, the Rennies 
acquisition created potential for strategic expansion into banking, freight, shipping services 
and the travel industry. The acquisition of the McCarthy automotive retailing business 
created a base for financial serv ices such as car financing, leasing and insurance. These 
services were added to Bidvest Bank (originally Rennies Bank, a bank that specialised in 
foreign exchange business targeting a niche (specialised) segment.  
The creation of critical mass ahead of rene wed growth was also evident in 2014 when 
Bidvest acquired the Mvelaserve group of corporate service businesses. Bidvest was, at the 
time, of the opinion that the acquisition would enable Mvelaserve to continue its customers 
more efficiently once it became a subsidiary of Bidvest. Services would be enhanced as 
Mvelaserve could use products supplied by Bidvest Hygiene Services, thereby bulking up its 
own services and rental and products. Mvelaserve also benefited from being able to offer its 
products to the w ider customer base of Bidvest. Bidvest simultaneously responded to the 
growing importance of consumer spending on the economy by purchasing the Home of 
Living Brands. The Home of Living Brands is a supplier of a wide range of consumer products 
to major ret ailers. This acquisition therefore expanded Bidvest's market to enter the retail 
industry that service consumers. Entry into another important industry that serves consumers 
was then achieved with the purchase of 35 per cent of the shares in the pharmaceut ical 
organisation, Adcock Ingram.  
Bidvest has grown from its humble beginning to a multi -national organisation. During 
the last 30 years, the company had to consider its own resources and capabilities as well as 
the opportunities in the external environmen t to make the best strategic choices. The current 
portfolio of the organisation is strategically diversified and the result of a number of 
strategic choices responding to market conditions.  
181 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
LO 1:  Understand  the nature  and use of strategic  goals  and strategic  choices  in 
providing strategic direction.  
7.1 Strategic goals and strategic choices  
In Chapter 3, we explained strategic planning as the responsibility of strategists to 
determine and  communicate the strategic direction of the organisation. In Chapter 3, we 
also highlighted the formulation of the vision, mission and strategic goals that provide an 
indication of strategic direction. We also considered how value statements can be used to  
keep the behaviour of all staff members in line with organisational expectations. We 
established that every organisation is part of a larger system and that interactions within 
this system are determined by various role -players, referred to as stakeholder s, present in 
the organisation’s business environment as well as the composition of the business 
environment. The first part of any strategy formulation process is thus to assess the current 
situation. The findings of such an assessment will inform the goa ls of the organisation with 
the overall goal of creating a strategic fit between the organisational resources and 
capabilities (which are explained in Chapter 6) and the opportunities present in the external 
environment (explained in Chapter 5). We note th at strategic goals are statements that 
express specific outcomes to be achieved. We also acknowledge that goals form the basis of 
a common language for understanding the wider context as it contains realistic measures of 
progress and achievement.6 
These measures of progress are set to support and achieve the strategic direction of 
the organisation. However, the primary objective of business strategy is to achieve a 
sustainable competitive advantage that leads to above -average performance and returns. To 
achieve this objective, managers and key employees need to make decisions on three levels:  
1. Organisational or corporate level. Decisions are taken about the overall purpose, 
scope, range and diversity of the organisation. These decisions are typically 
orches trated by senior management, such as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) 
or Managing Director (MD), the board of directors and other senior executives. 
The outcome of these decisions is corporate strategies, and the purpose of 
corporate strategy should be to  maximise stakeholder value in the long term by 
managing a portfolio of businesses.  
2. Business level. General managers of each line of business or strategic business 
unit (eg a subsidiary) determine which business (or competitive) strategies would 
be most su itable to achieving sustainable competitive advantage. These decisions 
constitute business -level strategies.  
3. Functional level. Managers lower down make decisions about how to best support 
business -level strategies by performing strategy -critical activities . These 
functional strategies include decisions, such as optimal staffing (the 
responsibility of the HR manager), marketing strategies (the responsibility of the 
marketing manager) or research and development initiatives.  
182  
CHAPTER 7:  DEVELOPING AND CHOOSING APPROPRIATE STRATEGIES  
In this chapter, we focus on corporate and business -level strategies. The corporate centre is 
typically the head office of a multi -business organisation (see Figure 7.2) and manages a 
portfolio of businesses with a view to maximising the value of the portfolio for the benefit 
of stakeholders. The corporate head office will typically add value to strategic business 
units (SBUs) by means of specific capabilities or shared corporate services. SBUs are 
organisatio nal units that exercise control over most of the resources they require to be 
successful (ie they are autonomous). Consider, for example, the Bidvest Group. The group 
operates through seven SBUs (also referred to as divisions), namely Automotive, 
Commercia l Products, Electrical, Financial Services, Freight, Office and Print and 
Services. In this case, the corporate centre adds value by ‘identifying strategic investment 
opportunities while promoting experience sharing across SBUs and fostering synergies and 
savings’. Specific examples of value added to SBUs include:7 
¦ access to corporate finance  
¦ Bidvest brand support  
¦ compliance  
¦ executive training, oversight  and management of organisation -wide  
financial management  
¦ investor relations and corporate communications  
¦ risk and sustainability issues  
¦ strategic direction.  
Each SBU is required to compete in their respective markets and industries with a view to 
establishing competitive advantage as a means of creating competitive advantage for their 
corporate owners.

Figure 7.2 The relationship between the corporate centre and strategic business units  
In this chapter, we will review different corporate and business strategic options that could 
be implemented to create strategic success based on an organisation’s proposed strategic 
direction, its strengths and weaknesses, as well as the opportunities and threats  presented in 
the environment in which it operates. The complexity of strategic choice lies in the 
alignment between choices and the realities found in the operating environment. In 
addition, strategy is developed overtime and often involves choices.  
183 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
LO 2:  Differentiate between the various corporate -level strategies that create  
corporate value and synergy.  
7.2 Corporate level strategic options: creating 
corporate value and synergy  
In order to create value for the organisation as a whole, executives need to make decisions 
about the growth path of the organisation. On a corporate level, executives on the highest 
level need to make decisions about the overall purpose, scope, range and diversity  of the 
organisation. In short, the corporate -level strategies deal with the number of products and 
services that the organisation will offer and the markets which will be pursued.  
In the case study on The Bidvest Group, we see how the organisation grew fr om its 
humble beginning in 1988 to become a leading multi -national organisation. The Bidvest 
Group strategy is based on strategic diversification, across industries and geographies. Note 
how this position was built over three decades as a result of a numbe r of strategic 
decisions.  
Whether an organisation operates as a multi -business or not, organisations have the 
option to pursue any, or a combination of, corporate strategies. We can broadly classify 
these strategies into the following categories:  
¦ Internal growth strategies  
¦ External growth strategies  
¦ Co-operative or corporate combination strategies  
¦ Turnaround and exit strategies.  
Each of these broad categories can be achieved by employing different strategic options. 
The choice of the most appropriate strategy is dependent on the strategic fit between the 
organisation’s internal strengths, capabilities and resources, and the opportunities available 
and threats facing the organisation in the external environment. Table 7.2 provides a 
summaiy of the corpo rate strategic options that will be discussed in this chapter.

7.2.1  Internal growth strategies  
Often the least risky option for organisations is to grow from within. This type of strategy 
aims to leverage the organisation’s current range of products (or services) and the markets 
it serves and propose growth strategies that combine new and/ or existing products and 
markets. Depending on whether products and markets are new or not, four internal growth 
strategies are possible, namely, market penetration, market development, product 
development and innovation.  
We will use Woolworths Holdings Limited (WHL) as an example to illustrate how it 
successfully employed each of the se strategies. WHL is one of the top 40 companies listed 
on the JSE Limited Securities Exchange (JSE). The organisation opened its first 
Woolworths clothing store in Adderley Street in Cape Town more than 80 years ago. Today 
the organisation is a leading r etail group with operations across the southern hemisphere.8 
Market penetration strategies  
Market penetration strategies aim to increase market share by selling more of the 
organisation’s existing products and/or services to its existing markets. One of th e strategic 
focus areas of Woolworth's, for example, is to ‘build stronger and more profitable customer 
relationships’.  
To achieve this objective, the organisation relies on customer insights and data 
obtained through the WRewards loyalty programme to info rm business decisions. At 
present, approximately 75 per cent of the 3.3 million Woolworths9 customers participate in 
this programme, which enables the organisation to track customer - spending patterns. In 
turn, customers earn rewards based on a tiered syst em determined by their annual spend at 
the retailer. In order to participate in and benefit from this programme, customers need to 
accept marketing material. This offers the organisation  
185 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
the opportunity to direct carefully selected promotions to market segments based on 
customer history. In addition, customers are encouraged to apply for a Woolworths Store 
Card or Credit Card. This allows them to buy on credit and enjoy an additional 5 pe r cent 
savings. The organisation realised that through effective database marketing campaigns, 
they can successfully increase spend per customer.10 
Market development strategies  
The aim of market development strategies is to grow turnover by selling the or ganisation’s 
existing products and/or services into new markets. For example, Woolworths expanded its 
footprint in areas where it had a low density of stores, or no stores, by opening stores at 
petrol station forecourts. This strategy is so successful that  the organisation now trades out 
of 72 Engen petrol forecourts selling food products across South Africa."  
Product development strategies  
The aim of product development strategies is to grow turnover by selling new products or 
services to the organisation’s existing market. Moving beyond retailing of quality food and 
fashion, Woolworths Financial Services was launched in 1993 in order to provide 
Woolworths’ customers with an in -store card and access to credit facilities. Over the years, 
its pro duct range has grown and today it offers a suite of financial products, including in -
store credit, credit cards, personal loans and a range of insurance products.  
Innovation strategies  
The aim of innovation strategies is to introduce advancements in technology and/ or 
services. These advancements are developed through research and development. 
Woolworths products and services are continuously advanced to create superior value. 
Consider, for example, Woolworths school shirts. These shirts have built -in ultra -violet 
protection and block out more than 98 per cent of harmful ultraviolet rays.12 
As can be observed from the Woolworths example, choices made on the basis of 
products and markets have successfully contributed to the organisation achieving its gr owth 
objectives. Read more about the organisation’s growth objectives in the practising strategy 
box below.  
186 CHAPTER 7: DEVELOPING AND CHOOSING APPROPRIATE STRATEGIES  
Practising strategy: Insight into Woolworths 
strategic focus13 
According to Ian Moir, Woolworth’s CEO, the future of retailers lies in the creation of 
amazing experiences for consumers and the combination of food and fashion. Retailers 
need to consider changing consumer behaviour and face the possibilities offered 
through online platforms. Moir says customers want to interact differently with 
retailers and want more personalised services.14 
Woolworths has six strategic focus areas that are driven at a group level. This 
organisation understands that their long -term succ ess depends on their ability to use 
their resources to implement the group's strategy. Table 7.3 reviews the performance 
indicators against various targets of Woolworths South Africa. The first column lists the 
six strategic focus areas of Woolworths South  Africa. The second column lists the 
performance measures used to evaluate the performance of each strategic focus. 
Finally, the third column reports the actual performance of Woolworths South Africa as 
reported in the WHS 2017 integrated report. These tar gets revolve around improved 
customer relationships, an increase in online sales of the organisation, an increase in 
sales as a leading fashion designer, an increase in food sales, improved synergies 
within the organisation and the organisation's targets i n terms of sustainability. 
Specifically, note that each organisation determines its own performance measures in 
line with the organisational objectives. These objectives should include clear targets, as 
well as timelines in which the targets should be achi eved. It is beyond the scope of this 
chapter to review performance measures and the measures listed below merely 
illustrate how Woolworths measures the performance of each strategic area.

7.2.2  External growth strategies  
Some organisations choose to grow by adding new businesses to their current portfolio, 
which is referred to as external growth strategies. These strategies create diversification by 
means of new products or markets or integration when organisations acquire an 
organisation similar to the current business.15 Strategic options to achieve external growth  
can be broadly classified as diversification and integration.  
Diversification strategies  
Diversification strategies are driven by two key objectives, namely, growth and risk 
reduction. However, diversification that only seeks growth or risk reduction is l ikely to 
destroy value. Conversely, if these objectives are supplemented by an intention to exploit 
economies of scope (in cases where it is cheaper to manufacture a variety of products 
together, rather than separately) in resources and capabilities, it ha s the potential to create 
stakeholder value.16 Once an organisation decides to diversify, it faces the choice of 
whether to diversify into related or unrelated businesses.  
Businesses are said to be related when there is a close resemblance between how 
they  perform key value chain activities. Pursuing this strategic option allows the 
organisation to build stakeholder value by leveraging synergies between the two 
organisations, enabling the organisation to perform better as a whole than just the sum of 
its in dividual businesses.17 An example of an organisation that employed this strategy 
successfully is VJO Attorneys. This boutique South African legal firm expanded their legal 
services and conveyance practice in 2011 to include a debt counselling practice, tak ing 
advantage of the opportunities created by the downturn in the economy.18 Debt counselling 
requires a strong legal background and there were many synergies between the resources 
and capabilities required by both the legal practice and debt counselling p ractice.  
An unrelated diversification strategy discounts the merits of pursuing a cross -
business strategic fit. Instead, it focuses on entering and operating businesses in industries 
with opportunities to realise consistently good financial results.19 An e xample of an 
organisation that achieved growth through unrelated diversification is the Bidvest Group, 
as illustrated in the case study. Today the group operates in the areas of consumer and 
industrial products, electrical products, financial services, fre ight management, office and 
print solutions, outsourced hard and soft services, travel and aviation services and 
automotive retailing.20 
Integration strategies  
Organisations often acquire other organisations similar to their own. The operative word 
here is similar , meaning that the operations of these organisations are incorporated within 
the current operations of organisations pursuing this strategic option. The se organisations 
aim to achieve growth through acquisitions of and/or mergers with competitors (horizontal 
integration) or suppliers or distributors (vertical integration).21 Mergers and acquisitions 
are discussed in more detail below.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
7.2.3  Co-operative or corporate combination strategies  
Co-operative or corporate combination strategies allow different organisations to form 
partnerships to share resources, capabilities or technical know -how (ie to  ‘combine’) to 
build a competitive advantage.22 We will briefly review four popular strategic options in 
this category, namely, strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions and mergers.  
Strategic alliance strategies  
A strategic alliance is a formal agreement between two or more separate organisations in 
which they agree to work collaboratively toward some strategically relevant goal.23 Such 
agreements typically entail organisations sharing financial responsibilities and require joint 
contributions of  capabilities and resources. Furthermore, organisations entering these 
agreements, share risks and control. The duration of such agreements is determined by the 
desired outcome thereof. Some agreements may include long term arrangements while others 
are de signed to accomplish short -term objectives. In these agreements, there is no formal 
ownership, but the relationship is guided by contractual arrangements.24 An accepted 
practice in the aviation industiy, for example, is code -share agreements, where two or more 
airlines share the same flight. A seat can be purchased on one airline, but is actually 
operated by a co -operative airline under a different flight number. This agreement allows 
greater access to more destinations through a given airline’s network wit hout having to 
offer extra flights. It also makes connections simpler by allowing single bookings across 
multiple planes.25 
Joint venture strategies  
When a strategic alliance involves ownership ties, it is called a joint venture. In this 
agreement, a new c orporate entity is formed and is jointly owned by two or more companies 
that agree to share in the revenues, expenses and control of the newly formed entity.26 In 
2013, South Africa’s Imperial Logistics announced that they entered into a joint venture 
with  international advisory and procurement firm, The Beijing Axis. The partnership 
enabled Imperial to improve its international supply chain management in Asia, and its 
clients to benefit from increasing trade between Africa and Asia.27 
Acquisition strategie s 
An acquisition occurs when one entity targets and buys another to become the sole owner 
of both. Consider the Noonan acquisition reported on in the opening case study. Bidvest 
bought Noonan in 2018 for approximately R2.7 billion ($208 million). Noonan is  a leading 
provider of strategic outsourcing and operates in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Noonan 
design and deliver services and solutions for many of the world’s largest and most 
prestigious organisations and are highly experienced in delivering large and complex 
facilities management outsourcing projects. They are recognised experts in first -generation 
outsourcing and provision of services to quality critical environments  
190 CHAPTER 7: DEVELOPING AND CHOOSING APPROPRIATE STRATEGIES  
and sectors with unique challenges. Examples of areas in which they operate are life 
sciences, retail, healthcare, education and police and justice. This acquisition supported 
Bidvest’s overall growth strategy and the purchase allowed the organisation to d iversify 
geographically. According to the CEO of Bidvest, Lindsay Ralphs, Noonan’s business 
model complements Bidvest and the acquisition helps the organisation to improve its 
services, increase its client base, and support international growth.28 
Merger s trategies  
A merger occurs when two separate entities combine forces to create a new organisation. 
An example of a merger was when two medium -sized South African audit, tax and financial 
and legal advisory service organisations merged in 2018. BDO South Afr ica merged with 
the Cape Town and Port Elizabeth offices of Grant Thornton. Both these offices then 
operated under the BDO brand. The merged organisation benefits from a scale -up of 
professional services and can now offer the full spectrum of professional services, 
including audit, company secretarial, business services and advisory services, corporate 
finance, cyber lab, economic incentives, and HR advisory service, internal audit and 
forensics services, legal services, risk advisory, tax, tech advisory, a nd wealth advisory 
services. The merger furthermore allowed the organisation to leverage the opportunities 
created by the changes in the auditing profession, including the introduction of mandatory 
audit firm rotation. BDO is now in a far stronger position  to take advantage of 
opportunities in the market and to provide the market with a significant alternative to 
competition.29 
7.2.4  Turnaround and exit strategies  
Operational realities and fierce competition often result in companies performing poorly 
over an extended time. These organisations are not in a position to grow and for them, 
survival becomes the core objective. In order to affect a turnaround, executives need to 
acknowledge problems and consider strategic options that could yield immediate returns. 
Unfortunately, sometimes there is no other option than to cut losses and exit the industry.  
In this section, we will review a few strategic options available to organisations 
facing this scenario. The practising strategy box on South African Airways’ turna round 
strategy below reviews key considerations for the new CEO to turnaround the performance 
of the national carrier.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Practising strategy: South African Airlines: 
We live in hope30 31 
On August 2017, South African Airways (SAA) appointed yet another CEO, Vuyani 
Jarana, whose responsibility it was to attempt implementing the organisation's ninth 
turnaround strategy in a little over a decade, inheriting a massive debt and maturing 
loans of a lmost R20bn over the next five years. In August 2019, Jarana resigned and 
SAA will need new leadership again.  
Key considerations for the new CEO include the following:  
1. Implement staff reductions. An audit needs to be conducted on the entire staff 
complement and benchmarks be done to determine the worker/aircraft 
personnel ratio. International best practice reported a ratio between 120 and 
140 employees per aircraft. The current SAA ratio is 190 employees per aircraft, 
which is approximately 46 per cent higher than the average. To be competitive, 
it would require SAA to retrench 3,000 employees, but this might not be 
realistic from a political standpoint.  
2. Update fleet. SAA's fleet does not match that of international competitors. The 
procurement of n ew aircraft seemed to be done without any larger strategy. For 
example, the five new A330 -300 aircraft acquired, have a range of 6,350 nautical 
miles, which can limit their usage in key European or Asian markets. The fleet of 
older Airbus aircraft was know n for high fuel consumption. If SAA wants to 
compete internationally in terms of cost efficiency in a comfort - driven long -
haul market, they need to consider updating their fleet with the prevailing best 
sellers of the A350 -900 or B787 variant. This would,  however, require huge 
capital investments.  
3. Servicing sensible routes. SAA faces a chicken and egg situation when it comes 
to routes. To service routes, airlines compete on extremely tight margins and 
often uncontrollable extraneous factors. SAA will requi re the right equipment 
and rigorous internal controls to contain operational costs. It would help if SAA 
operated a lean and profitable route network and entered into code sharing 
partnerships to cover destinations that it could not be serve profitably 
previously. Over the longer term, a more city -to-city direct approach to 
connectivity needs to be established.  
4. Implementing international services from Cape Town. Cape Town is one of 
South Africa's main tourism destinations and is considered an important 
business hub, with a population of 4 million. Therefore, Cape Town should be 
regarded as a core component of the airline's global route network.  
192 CHAPTER 7: DEVELOPING AND CHOOSING APPROPRIATE STRATEGIES  
5. Liaison more efficiently with South  African tourism. As the South African 
national airline, SAA should partner with South African Tourism, the country's 
national tourism board. The partners could then work together to develop 
travel packages to popular South African tourist destinations.  
6. Providing some extras. Many airlines allow greater weight allowances for 
travellers and SAA needs to consider providing travellers with some extras that 
would distinguish them from their rivals.  
7. Improving service levels. SAA needs to develop a commitment to outstanding 
service. Given the intensity of international rivals, any turnaround strategy could 
fail (again) as a result of lacklustre or uninspiring service. When evaluating 
services, customer satisfaction surveys should be complemented with staff 
morale surveys to determine the relationship between staff morale and 
customer satisfaction.  
8. De-politicising the airline. An independent assessment of all business linkages 
needs to be established to rid the airline of the bad habits of graft and 
patronage. The 2 015 Ernst ft Young forensic investigation into 48 tenders at 
SAA indicated that 28 of these did not comply with tender requirements.  
At the time of writing this chapter, the public and media were speculating whether 
South Africa could really afford a natio nal carrier, or whether some degree of part - 
privatisation is necessary. This follows the request from the airline for yet another cash 
injection by the Finance Minister to keep the airline flying by providing salaries and 
urgent debt repayment. The nation  lives in hope that SAA will stabilise.  
In the shorter term, the most successful turnaround strategies focus on reducing direct 
operational costs and improving productivity gains. Three strategic options that can be 
used to achieve these objectives are ret renchment, recovery and revenue growth.  
Retrenchment strategies  
Retrenchment strategies are typically used to reduce the size or diversity (in terms of the 
number of product offerings or strategic business units) of the organisation. This strategy 
takes two forms, namely, cost -cutting and reducing non -core assets. In the SAA example 
above, overwhelming evidence suggests that a combination of systematic weaknesses are 
the result of a lack of internal control. Suggestions are, for example, that the SAA boar d 
approved wasteful and irregular expenditure. Cost - cutting will only incur when internal 
controls are in place to ensure operational efficiency, reliable financial reporting and 
compliance with laws and regulations. Cost -cutting would also result if staf f are reduced in 
line with international best practice and if mechanisms are put in place to ensure optimum 
performance.32 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Recovery strategies  
Recovery strategies are used to stabilise the b usiness. This strategy is often employed in 
response to externally induced problems and a recovery strategy aims to introduce new 
entrepreneurial blood in the form of turnaround specialists or a new leadership team. The 
appointment of Mr Vuyani Jarana on 1  November 2017 as new CEO of SAA was part of the 
recovery strategy of the airline. Following his resignation, it needs a new recovery strategy.  
Revenue growth strategies  
Revenue growth strategies aim to grow sales in various ways, for example, decreasing 
selling prices, increasing promotions, implementing product modifications, appointing 
more sales staff and improving customer service.  
Divestiture strategies  
Turnaround can also be achieved through divestiture. A divestiture is the partial or full 
disposal  of assets or SBUs through sale, exchange or closure. Divestiture results from a 
management decision to cease operations in a particular area because it is no longer part of 
a core competency or when it is no longer profitable.33 SAA, for example, should 
reconsider its current routes, suspend some routes, and minimise loss -making international 
networks.  
Liquidation strategies  
If none of the options above (retrenchment, recovery, revenue growth or divestiture 
strategies) are viable, the organisation would ha ve no other choice but to exit the industry. 
In order to exit, executives may sell the organisation, liquidate the organisation or declare 
bankruptcy.34 A liquidation strategy implies that the entire organisation be sold -off, either 
as a whole or in parts of it. Liquidation can be voluntary or, in the case of bankruptcy 
(where the organisation can no longer pay its debts), can be directed by the court.  
In summary, this section provided an overview of the various options for corporate -
level strategies. In th e following section, our attention shifts to the management of the 
multi -business organisation.  
LO 3:  Discuss  the management  of the multi -business  organisation  
7.3 Managing the multi -business organisation  
Managing a sometimes diverse group of business units in  an organisation, requires action 
that is tailored to the circumstances confronting each business unit with due consideration 
to the resultant impact on the entire organisation. A useful management tool to provide a 
snapshot view of an organisation’s inves tments is two -dimensional  
194  
CHAPTER 7: DEVELOPING AND CHOOSING APPROPRIATE STRATEGIES  
matrices. Executives can use various adaptations of well -established portfolio matrices, 
such as the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix, the directional policy matrix (General 
Electric -McKinsey matrix), the SPACE or the parenting matrix.35 For purposes of this 
chapter, we will focus on the directional policy matrix as illustrated in Figure 7.3.  
o 
Size of

The directional policy matrix positions the various strategic business units (SBUs) of an 
organisation according to (1) the long -term attractiveness of the relevant market in which 
they operate, ranging from low to high (depicted on the vertical axis of this m atrix), and 
(2) the competitive strength of the SBU in the market, ranging from strong to weak 
(depicted on the horizontal axis of the matrix). The matrix further allows analysts to 
illustrate the relative size of the market, as well as the market share of  the SBU. In Figure 
7.3, the size of the market is indicated in blue, whereas the market share is indicated in 
grey. This snapshot serves to inform portfolio strategies to guide corporate decision -
making in terms of financial investment and divestment. Inv estment would be appropriate 
in instances in which the market is attractive and the SBU displays a relative strength in 
that industry. Divestment would be considered in unattractive markets where the SBU 
display a competitive weakness. If we look at Figure  7.3, the smallest circle indicates a 
strong SBU in terms of market share, but the long -term market attractiveness is very low. 
The biggest circle indicted in Figure 7.3 indicates an SBU with a medium to weak market 
share, with high long -term market attrac tiveness. The organisation might decide to rather 
invest most of its resources indicated in the SBU with the biggest market share, with 
medium long -term market attractiveness. These decisions also need to consider the 
organisation’s strategic direction, po tential for growth elsewhere and possible synergies 
among SBUs.  High

With this in mind, it is clear that matrices such as these, only provide a simplistic 
view and should be supported by sound business intelligence. Each matrix gives more or 
less attention to one of three criteria:37 
¦ the balance of the portfolio, for example, in relation to its markets and the needs 
of the organisation  
¦ the attractiveness of the business units in terms of their individual competitive 
positioning a nd how profitable their markets or industries are likely to be in 
future  
¦ the ‘fit’ that the business units have with one another in terms of potential 
synergies or the extent to which the corporate parent will be good at managing 
them and assisting them in  creating value in the corporate portfolio.  
An understanding of where the organisation want to go should be followed by an agreement 
on how to compete in order to get there. The next section focuses on the various business -
level strategic options.  
LO 4:  Differentiate between the various business -level strategies for creating and  
sustaining competitive advantage.  
7.4 Business -level strategic options: creating and 
sustaining competitive advantage  
Corporate -level strategies essentially deal with the number of pr oducts and services that the 
organisation will offer and the markets which they will pursue. Business -level, or 
competitive, strategies consider how to compete successfully in these markets. In other 
words, these strategies focus on how to position an orga nisation within an industry in such 
a way that it has competitive advantage.  
There are many variations in business -level strategies, but if we strip away the details 
to get to the real substance, the biggest and most significant differences among competitive 
strategies are reduced to the following:  
¦ whether an organisation’s target market is broad or narrow  
¦ whether the organisation is pursuing a competitive advantage linked to low cost 
or product differentiation  
¦ a combination of the above.38 
When you ask customers why they buy a specific product or service, they will tell you that 
it is because the product is cheaper than, different from or provides a better value 
proposition than alternative competing choices. Although these are broad generalisati ons, 
important implications which represent the generic strategic options for achieving 
competitive advantage flow from them. Four distinct generic competitive strategy 
approaches stand out:39-40 
196  
CHAPTER 7: DEVELOPING AND CHOOSING  APPROPRIATE STRATEGIES  
Cost leadership strategies  
A cost leadership strategy involves becoming the lowest cost organisation (with regard to 
production cost) in a domain of activity by a significant margin. This strategy will typically 
target a broad spect rum of buyers. It is important to note that cost leadership does not 
necessarily imply low price - in fact, having low production costs and a low price will 
result in average returns and no real competitive advantage.  
Differentiation strategies  
A different iation strategy involves uniqueness along some dimension that is sufficiently 
valued by customers to allow a price premium. This strategy may focus on either a broad 
section of buyers or a narrow buyer segment.  
Focus strategies  
A focus strategy involves targeting a narrow segment or domain of activity and tailoring its 
products or services to the needs of that specific segment, to the exclusion of others.  
Best cost provider strategies  
A best cost provider strategy is a hybrid strategy that involves giving  customers more value 
for their money by offering upscale product attributes at a lower production cost than 
rivals.  
Each of these four generic competitive approaches stakes out a different market 
position, as illustrated in Figure 7.4.

Figure 7.4 Business -level strategies*'  
Figure 7.4 illustrates that the type of business -level strategy is determined by two 
factors. The first factor is the type of competitive advantage offered by the  
197  
PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
organisation (either lower cost,  differentiation, or a combination of lower cost and 
differentiation), which is depicted on the horizontal axis of Figure 7.4. The second factor is 
the target market pursued by the organisation (either broad or focused), which is depicted 
on the vertical a xis of Figure 7.4. A best cost provider strategy is depicted in the middle of 
Figure 7.4 - indicating a strategy positioned between the extremes of a lower cost and 
differentiation on the horizontal axis and between the extremes of a broad and focused 
strategy on the vertical axis. These strategies relate to the organisation’s deliberate 
decisions on how to meet its customers’ needs, how to counter the competitive efforts of its 
rivals, how to cope with the existing market conditions and how to sustain or b uild its 
competitive advantage. Some companies choose to focus their strategic efforts to build 
leadership in one type of competitive advantage. A good example of such an organisation is 
PEP Stores which is known for overall cost leadership in all the prod uct categories they 
offer. Other companies, such as Unilever, aim to serve several market segments by offering 
different products to different markets. Consider the information in the practising strategy 
box that follows, which is based on Unilever’s posit ion strategies and then reflect on the 
different business -level strategies employed by this organisation in the washing powder

Surf washing powder is known for its super whitening 
power.  
Surf washing powder is one of the oldest washing powders 
on the market in South Africa. It was launched in 1959. 
Surf washing powder is known for its super whitening 
power. It has been used and trusted by many people over 
the years, because of its reputati on for maintaining the 
whiteness of white garments.  
Surf is a handwashing powder. Because of high foaming, it 
is not suitable for washing machines - twin tubs, top 
loaders and front loaders.  
Although consolidated market positions are achieved over time, organisations often need to 
review different strategic choices more frequently. Once an organisation has selected 
potential business -level strategies, it needs to evaluate these options to choose the most 
appropriate business -level strategy or combination of strategies. The next section focuses 
on the evaluation of strategic choices.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
LO 5:  Explain  the evaluation  of strategic  choices.  
7.5 Evaluating strategic choices  
Strategies can be evaluated against three key evaluation criteria, namely, suitability, 
acceptability and feasibility. Suitability  considers whether the proposed strategies address 
the key issues related to the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and thre ats the 
organisation faces. Suitable strategies need to take advantage of external opportunities and 
internal strengths while, at the same time, overcoming external threats and internal 
weaknesses. In order to identify whether a strategy is suitable, the s trategist should have a 
good understanding of the internal environment of the organisation (the focus of Chapter 
6), as well as of the external environment (the focus of Chapter 5), in which the 
organisation operates. In practice, it often happens that mor e than one strategy may be 
suitable, but that limited resources necessitate the screening of options so that the most 
appropriate strategy can be selected.  
Strategies are acceptable if their expected performance outcomes meet the 
expectations of all stakeholders. Since the acceptability  of a strategy option is determined by 
expected performance outcomes, this criterion requires strategists to consider risk, r eturn 
and stakeholder reaction. We find that organisations, regardless of the industry in which 
they operate, mostly engage in formal risk assessment if strategic options require 
substantial investments. Tools such as sensitivity analysis, financial ratios , and break -even 
analysis are useful to evaluate risks. These aspects are dealt with in Chapter 14. The second 
consideration is return, which refers to the financial benefits which stakeholders are 
expected to receive from a strategy. To assess return, str ategists can use different 
measurements such as financial analysis, shareholder value analysis, cost -benefit 
evaluations and the real option approach. To assess the final consideration, which is the 
reaction of stakeholders, strategists can make use of sta keholder mapping.  
Finally, a strategy is feasible when the organisation has, or can obtain, the 
capabilities required to deliver a strategy. To assess feasibility,  strategists need to address 
two key questions:  
1. Do the resources and competencies currently e xist to implement a strategy 
effectively?  
2. If not, can they be obtained?  
The answers should be informed by considering financial and human resource requirements, 
as well as resource integration.45 
Although the criteria seem to be quite straight forward, the  reality is that each 
criterion can only be assessed if key strategic issues dealing with it are identified by means 
of a comprehensive internal and external environmental analysis.  
#***********************************   
CHAPTER 7: D EVELOPING AND CHOOSING APPROPRIATE STRATEGIES  
The big picture  
Choosing appropriate strategies is not possible unless they are aligned with organisational 
resources and capabilities and the opportunities available in the external environment. As a 
result, strategy selection is a dynamic process that is subject to chan ge. We need to realise 
that there is not a ‘one size fits all’ option. Organisations are different in terms of their 
overall purpose, scope, range and diversity of products and/or services, as well as in terms 
of the markets they serve. On a corporate leve l, portfolios need to be managed in such a 
way that the corporate parent creates value for the SBUs. Each SBU needs to be positioned 
within an industry in which it has a competitive advantage (see Figure 7.5). There are 
various strategic options available to companies to achieve this, but each organisation has 
unique needs and the application of options will differ accordingly. Finally, strategic 
options need to be evaluated to determine their suitability, acceptability and feasibility. The 
outcome of this evaluation will indicate whether the strategy selected has a strategic fit 
within the operating environment.

Summary of learning outcomes  
LO 1: Understand the nature and use of strategic goals and strategic choices to 
provide strategic direction.  
Strategic goals are statements that express specific outcomes to be achieved. These goals 
are set to support and achieve the strategic direction of the organisation. To achieve 
strategic goals, managers and key employees need to make strategic choices on three 
levels. First, decisions are taken about the overall purpose, scope, rang e and diversity of 
the organisation. The outcome of these choices is corporate strategies that aim to maximise 
stakeholder value in the long term by managing a portfolio of businesses. Second, 
decisions are taken about how to differentiate each strategic  
201 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
business unit. The outcome of these choices is business -level strategies that determine 
competitive advantage. Third, decisions are required on a functional level about how to 
best suppor t business -level strategies by performing strategy -critical activities.  
LO 2: Differentiate between the various corporate -level strategies that create 
corporate value and synergy.  
Corporate -level strategies determine the overall purpose, scope, range and diversity of the 
organisation. In this chapter, we discussed internal growth strategies, external growth 
strategies, corporate combination strategies, turnaround and exit strategies. We also 
reviewed strategic options that can be followed in support of the  strategy types listed 
above.  
LO 3: Discuss the management of the multi -business organisation.  
To manage multi -business organisations, strategic decisions should be tailored to the 
circumstances confronting each business unit, with due consideration to the  resultant 
impact on the entire organisation. In this chapter, we propose that executives would benefit 
from depicting SBUs on portfolio matrices to get a snapshot of the entire organisation. This 
snapshot would then serve to inform portfolio strategies to  guide corporate decision -
making with regards to financial investment and divestment. These decisions also need to 
take into consideration the organisation’s strategic direction, potential for growth 
elsewhere, and possible synergies among SBUs. Matrices s hould further be supported by 
sound business intelligence.  
LO 4: Differentiate between the various business -level strategies for creating 
and sustaining competitive advantage.  
Business -level strategies take into consideration to compete successfully in the se markets. 
In this chapter, we reviewed four different strategic options, namely, cost leadership, 
differentiation, focused and best cost provider strategies.  
LO 5: Explain the evaluation of strategic choices.  
Strategies can be evaluated against three key evaluation criteria, namely, suitability, 
acceptability and feasibility. Suitability  considers strategic fit between the organisation’s 
capabilities and resources and the opportunities present in the external e nvironment. 
Strategies are acceptable if the expected performance outcome of the strategy meets the 
expectation of all stakeholders. Finally, a strategy is feasible when the organisation has, or 
can obtain, the capabilities required to deliver a strategy.

In Chapter 2, you were introduced to strategy -as-practice, which 
recognises that strategic management is a dynamic discipline and that 
its key influences change over time. Although there are many different 
views on how strategic management should be done, Chapter 2 
outlined seven universal principles that underlie the different views of 
strategy and strategic management. In short, in accordance with these 
principles, strategy is about positive  change; it takes a long term view; 
is complex; has an internal and external focus; is both deliberate and 
emergent; involves different thought processes; and happens at 
different hierarchical levels in organisations.  Chapter 3 provided c overage of the process perspective of strategic 
management. The approach in terms of strategic management adopted 
in this book is that strategic management is a complex and dynamic 
discipline and that a static, linear process does not take into account 
the complexity or the environment in which the organisation operates. 
However, the process perspective of strategic management is a 
valuable instrument or model that offers a sound theoretical 
foundation from which to work. The process perspective of strategi c 
management identified three stages or phases, namely, strategic 
planning, strategy implementation and strategic control. Strategic 
planning is a conceptual process that consists of an environmental 
analysis and the development of strategies. These were d ealt with in 
Chapter 3 [A process perspective of strategic management),  Chapter 5 
[The context of strategy),  Chapter 6 [Strategic resources and capabilities)  
and Chapter 7 [Developing and choosing appropriate strategies).  
World -class processes will not lea d to successful organisations 
without the correct strategic direction. The best strategy in the world 
will get nowhere without strong operations to implement it. In this 
chapter, our focus turns to strategy implementation. First, the term 
'strategy impleme ntation' is explained and we differentiate between 
the concepts 'strategy formation' and 'implementation'. Second, the 
barriers to successful strategy implementation are explored, after which 
the principle to overcoming these barriers is explained. The sec ond 
part of the chapter focuses on change as an integral part of strategy 
implementation. As such, change and strategic change is first 
explained, followed by a discussion of the various types of strategic 
change. Then, we differentiate between various mod els of planned 
change. Lastly, the chapter identifies barriers to successful strategic 
change and ways to overcome them. Figure 8.1 highlights the focus of 
this chapter.

NASPERS  
Founded in 1915 in Stellenbosch, South Africa, Naspers is a global internet and 
entertainment group and is one of the largest technology investors in the world. Operating 
in more than 130 countries and markets with long -term growth potential, Naspers builds 
leading companies that empower people and enrich communities. The strategy of the 
company is stated as follows:  
We believe in the power of local, backed by global scale - we back new business 
models to fuel our growth and increasi ngly we look for opportunities to address 
new big societal needs in markets where  we see the greatest growth potential. 
These include all major markets in the world.  
We believe  we are the best global growth partner for founders, start -ups and other 
investo rs with the ambition to scale in our markets.  
Naspers' operating model is different from many other companies. They both invest and 
manage leading companies and add value at all life -stages. They create their own 
businesses or invest in early -stage compani es, take promising modes and grow them 
quickly to scale, they grow companies already at scale and they hold investments in listed 
companies with significant upside.  
The following examples clearly illustrate the implementation of the strategy and the various 
change programmes that the company successfully underwent since its  
establishment in 1915.  
209 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Naspers was founded to produce a Dutch language newspaper, De Burger.  In the 1920s, 
Naspers added book publishing to its operations and during the next 60 years, it grew into 
one of Africa's leading media groups. In 1985, M -Net was founded, Naspers' first pay -TV 
business and in 1997, MWEB was founded, the company's first internet service. In  1994, the 
company listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. In 2001, Naspers invested in Tencent 
Holdings, which represented the beginning of its growth into a global internet and 
entertainment group and in 2008, it acquired Allegro and entered the B2C e -commerce 
segment. In 2010, the company acquired a majority share in OLX as a foundation to build its 
online classifieds business segment. In 2015, the company celebrated its 100th year, 
operating in over 130 countries and markets. In the same year, Nasper s bought majority 
shares in Avito and in 2016, the company entered the Edtech sector with early -stage 
investments in Brainly, Codecademy and Udemy. In 2017, Naspers closed a deal on the 
divestment of Allegro, achieving a transaction to the value of US$3,25 3 billion. In the same 
year, the company closed the Ibibo/MakeMyTrip transaction, creating one of the largest 
travel groups in India, invested €387 million in Delivery Hero, and invested US$80 million in 
Indian -based food ordering and delivery platform, Sw iggy. In 2018, Naspers completed its 
sale of Tencent shares, reducing its stake from 33.2 per cent to 31.2 per cent, yielding US$9.8 
billion. In the same year, the company also sold its stake in Flipkart.  
Today, Naspers is organised into six business areas : 
Classifieds. Their classifieds business, the OLX Group, provides local mobile and digital 
marketplaces that connect more than 350 million buyers and sellers every month in 
more than 40 countries around the world. Their companies, OLX, Avito and letgo, 
between them, are among the top -ranked mobile classifieds applications in more than 
20 countries.  
Payments. PayU is one of the largest payment service platforms in the world, focusing 
on markets with long -term growth potential. It has leading positions acr oss Africa and 
the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, India, and Latin America. PayU's 250 
payment options enable safe transactions in 16 countries for more than 160,000 
merchants, enabling them to focus on reaching the 2.2 billion consumers in their  
markets.  
B2C. Their B2C eCommerce segment contains their business to consumer e -commerce 
companies and investments. These businesses are leading players in Latin America, 
Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa and include Allegro, Avenida,  
eMAG, Flipkart, Konga, Amazon.ae, and Takealot, as well as online travel businesses 
such as Goibibo and Redbus.  
Ventures. Their ventures team hunts for new opportunities to back high potential 
internet businesses and help their founders to scale globally.  
Video Entertainment. Through MultiChoice South Africa and MultiChoice Africa, their 
video entertainment division brings quality entertainment anytime, anywhere, on any 
device to more than 10 million subscribing households in more than 50 countries across 
sub-Saharan Africa.  
210 CHAPTER 8: STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION AS CHANGE MANAGEMENT  
Media. Naspers started as a print business in 1915 with their Dutch language 
newspaper De Burger.  Today, the group has grown beyond recognition, and since 2000, 
their news and print businesses have been organised under the umbrella brand, 
Media24. It is South Africa's leading publisher, with more than 40 magazines and 80 
newspapers and reaches more th an 13 million monthly unique browsers across its 
digital platforms. Media24 has interests in digital media and services, newspapers, 
magazines, e -commerce, book publishing, print and distribution and continues to shape 
the media landscape.

LO 1:  Explain  'strategy  implementation'  and differentiate  between  strategy  
formation and implementation.  
8.1 What is strategy implementation and how does it 
differ from strategy formation?  
Strategy implementation can be defined as the process during which the organisation draws 
on both human and non-human factors to ensure that its strategy is executed in line with 
the plans devised during the strategy formation phase. Strategy implementation is the 
action phase of strategic management. Stated differently, strategy implementation is the 
process wh ereby selected strategies are turned into action in order to realise the vision, 
mission and goals of the organisation. Therefore, strategy implementation deals primarily 
with change by translating organisational strategies into action. What has been plann ed 
must now be executed. It is the phase of the strategic management process where 
management aligns strategic leadership, organisational culture, organisational structures, 
rewards systems, policies and resource allocation with its chosen strategies. Stra tegy 
implementation is often regarded as the most difficult part of strategic management. The 
implementation of strategies is that part where strategies often fail. The opening case study 
of this chapter illustrates the successful implementation of Naspers ’ strategy of looking for 
opportunities to address new big societal needs in markets where they see the greatest 
growth potential. This includes all major markets in the world. Starting as the producer of a 
newspaper in Stellenbosch, the company diversifie d into book publishing, pay television 
business, internet services, e -commerce and entertainment business on a global scale - all 
of these decisions required organisational changes to ensure their successful 
implementation.  
Strategy formation and implement ation differ from each other in a number of 
important ways:  
¦ Strategy formation is regarded as the intellectual phase of strategic management, 
while strategy implementation is the ‘action’ phase.  
¦ Internal and external forces drive strategy formation, wherea s strategy 
implementation is mainly driven by internal, organisational and operations - 
related forces.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
¦ Strategy formation requires strategists to be intuitive with good analytical and 
forecasting abilities, while strategy implementation requires strategists to have 
excellent motivation and leadership skills, in other words, people - related skills.  
¦ Strategy formation is regarded as the main responsibility of senior management 
(although t here is a drive towards wider participation based on the strategy -as-
practice approach), whereas lower levels of management are regarded as having 
the responsibility to implement strategies.  
¦ Strategy formation is concerned with the overall goals and object ives of the 
organisation, whereas strategy implementation is concerned with the deliberate 
choice of a set of activities or steps needed to achieve strategic goals.  
¦ Strategy formation follows a top -down approach - the strategic goals and plans 
that are dev eloped, lead to the development of tactical and operational goals and 
plans. On the operational level, goals and plans for portfolios, programmes, 
projects, deliverables and activities are developed. Strategy implementation 
follows a bottom -up approach - the execution of activities leads to the realisation 
of planned deliverables, deliverables will realise project goals, the realisation of 
project goals will lead to the realisation of programme and portfolio goals. Then, 
the realisation of portfolio goals w ill lead to the realisation of operational, 
tactical and ultimately, strategic goals. This is illustrated in Figure 8.2.

212 CHAPTER 8: STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION AS CHANGE MANAGEMENT  
A portfolio is regarded as an investment fund aimed at managing and attaining strategic 
goals and plans. A portfolio funds various approved projects. A project has a clear 
objective with an organised set of activities to be carried out in order to attain its 
objective. E ach project in a portfolio is prioritised and activated based on its contribution 
to the strategic goals and plans of the organisation. Projects are unique and are not 
repeated exactly. They integrate various functions, contractors and departments in an 
organisation. Organisations can undertake various projects, for example, projects in 
research and development, the development of new products and/ or services, product 
and/or service enhancements, information systems development, process improvement, 
busine ss improvement, event management and mergers and acquisitions. A project consists 
of various deliverables, whereas deliverables consist of various activities.  
Strategy formation and implementation is an integrated process. Although the 
process perspective of strategic management (discussed in Chapter 3) indicates a clearly 
divided and neatly performed process consisting of different phases, strategic management, 
in practice, is a fully integrated process with overlaps between strategy formation, 
implementat ion and control. Formation decisions have a direct impact on strategy 
implementation - they influence the approval of projects and the subsequent execution of 
deliverables and activities. The execution of activities influence the attainment of 
deliverables  and ultimately, the attainment of portfolio, operational, tactical and strategic 
goals. Success in both strategy formation and implementation is necessary to attain 
superior organisational performance. Strategy formation and implementation are both an art  
and a science; it incorporates both a rational, analytical element and an element of 
creativity. In the following section, we will address the barriers to successful strategy 
implementation.  
LO 2:  Explain  the various  barriers  to successful  strategy  implem entation  
8.2 Barriers to successful strategy implementation  
In Chapter 3 (Section 3.4.1), the balanced scorecard (BSC) was identified as a strategic 
management tool, developed by Kaplan and Norton2, which can be used in strategy 
formation as it guides the orga nisation and management team to translate the strategic 
direction into strategic goals. One of the benefits of the BSC is that it offers a balanced 
approach to setting strategic goals. The ‘balance’ is grounded in its four perspectives, 
namely, financial, customer, learning and growth, and business processes. The BSC enables 
organisations to clarify their vision and strategy, thus making it possible to translate them 
into action. Therefore, the true purpose of the BSC is to translate strategy into action. 
Further research conducted by Kaplan and Norton and other researchers, estimated that 80 
to 90 per cent of organisations fail when it comes to strategy implementation. Kaplan and 
Norton’s research identified four main barriers to successful strategy executi on, namely:  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
¦ The people barrier. As indicated in Section 8.1, strategy implementation is the 
‘action’ phase of strategic management, where the successful execution of 
activities by various people is the first step in the realisation of organisational 
goals and ultimately, its vision (see Figure 8.2). Therefore, it is imperative that 
organisational reward and incentive systems be linked to strategy implementation 
to assist in overcoming the n atural resistance to change that can be expected. 
Kaplan and Norton’s research indicated that only 25 per cent of organisational 
management has incentives directly linked to strategy implementation, which was 
indicated as a people barrier.  
¦ The vision barri er. Ultimately, the execution of all the activities, deliverables and 
the outcomes of the portfolios should lead to the attainment of strategic goals and 
the organisation’s vision. Therefore, each individual should have a clear 
understanding, first of the vision and second, of the strategy that the organisation 
intends to implement in order to realise its vision. Kaplan and Norton’s research 
indicated that only 5 per cent of the workforce of organisations actually 
understand the strategy that the organisati on intends to implement to realise its 
vision.  
¦ The management barrier. Strategic management in practice is a fully integrated 
process with overlaps between strategy formation, implementation and control - a 
process that needs to be managed continuously. Ka plan and Norton’s research 
indicated that 85 per cent of the executive teams of organisations spend less than 
an hour per month managing and discussing organisational strategy.  
¦ The resource barrier. Resources are needed for strategy formation, 
implementati on and control, and budgeting which plays a pivotal role in strategic 
management. Kaplan and Norton’s research indicated that more than 60 per cent 
of organisations fail to link their strategy to a budget.  
In order to increase value, organisations need to overcome these barriers to strategy 
implementation by implementing a formal process. This can be achieved through the five 
principles of strategy implementation. These principles are discussed in the section that 
follows.  
LO 3:  Explain  the principles  of strategy  implementation.  
8.3 Principles of strategy implementation  
To overcome the barriers to successful strategy implementation, Kaplan and Norton* 
highlighted five principles of successful strategy implementation, based on the BSC. They 
called these the ‘principles of a strategy -focused organisation’, which are explained below.  
214 CHAPTER 8: STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION AS CHANGE MANAGEMENT  
Principle 1: Translate the strategy to operational terms.  
The first principle entails translating the corporate strategy into the logical architecture of a 
strategy map and BSC to specify the details of the critical elements of the corporate 
strategy. A strategy map is drawn up by specifying strategic objectives for each element 
(financial, customer, inter nal business processes, learning and growth) of the BSC, as 
indicated in the example in Figure 8.3. The organisation should not have more than 20 
objectives - tracking too many strategic objectives will dilute the overall goals of the 
organisation. Strateg y maps can also have arrows between the objectives to show their main 
cause -and-effect chain. By following the arrows’ paths, we can see how the objectives in 
the lower perspectives (learning and growth, internal business processes), drive the success 
of the higher ones (customer and financial). With a well -designed strategy map, every 
individual employee will know the vision and overall strategy of the organisation. Also, 
every employee will know where he or she fits into the big picture of this overall vi sion and 
strategy. This principle is imperative in creating a common understanding and point of 
reference for all individuals, functional units and business units in the organisation. It helps 
to overcome the vision barrier.  
 
Figure 8.3 An example of a strategy map  
215 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Principle 2: Align the organisation to its corporate strategy.  
Organisations consist of various sectors, business units and functional departments, each 
with their own operations and often, each with their own strategies (refer to Chapter 2, 
Table 2.1, which illustrates strategic management and decision -maki ng at various 
hierarchical levels). Functional departments, such as finance, marketing, procurement, and 
so on, have their own bodies of knowledge, language and culture. Functional silos may 
arise and become a major barrier in successful strategy implement ation, since organisations 
may experience difficulty in communicating and co -ordinating activities across these 
specialised functions. For an organisation to create synergy (to be more than the sum of its 
various parts), individual strategies must be align ed, integrated and linked. Therefore, the 
second principle involves the creation of synergy to ensure that these linkages actually 
occur. In other words, it entails aligning all hierarchical levels (business units, functional 
units and individual employees ) to the strategy. In practice, this step will require the 
following: (1) each business unit will develop a long -term plan and BSC consistent with 
strategic priorities; and (2) each functional unit will develop a plan and BSC for best 
practice sharing to c reate synergies across business units. When this process is complete, 
all units should have well -defined strategies that are articulated and measured by BSCs and 
strategy maps. Linkages should also be established across boundaries with external 
stakeholder s, such as customers and suppliers (refer to Chapter 1, Section 1.7, for an 
explanation of internal and external stakeholders). BSCs can also be developed to define 
the organisation’s relationship with these stakeholders. The execution of this step will he lp 
overcome the people barrier through initiatives that support strategy implementation. The 
importance of appropriate change management and effective communication should be 
acknowledged in this steps. (Change management is addressed in detail in Section 8.4).  
Figure 8.4 illustrates how this principle is executed. For illustrative purposes, the 
strategic priorities identified in the corporate scorecard are financial growth, improved 
stakeholder value, corporate citizenship, and research and development. Th e organisation 
may have a number of different business units and a number of functional units, such as 
finance, marketing, procurement, operations, public relations and information technology. 
The external stakeholders identified as important and which sho uld be linked to the 
corporate strategy are customers, suppliers and distributors.

measurement  to strategic management: Part II. American Accounting Association, Accountinq horizons. 15(2): 150.  
Principle 3: Make strategy everyone's everyday job.  
Senior management and other strategists cannot implement strategies on their own - they 
need the actions and ideas from everyone in the organisation. The third principle requires 
that all employees understand the strategy and conduct their day -to-day activities in such a 
way that it contributes to the success of the strategy. During this stage, organi sations 
should also link their reward systems to the BSC. The execution of this stage is required to 
overcome the resource barrier.  
217 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Principle 4: Viewing strategy as a continual process.  
The fourth principle introduces strategic management as a double -loop process, which 
integrates the management of tactics with the management of strategy. This is achieved 
through the execution of three steps. First, organisations should link strategy to t he 
budgeting process. In terms of budgeting, it is useful to have two kinds of budgets, namely, 
strategic and operational budget. Strategic budgets enable organisations to develop entirely 
new capabilities (refer to Chapter 6 where organisational resources  and capabilities were 
explained), reach new customers and/or new markets, become good corporate citizens or 
improve existing processes and capabilities. An operational budget authorises spending for 
the production and delivery of existing products and/or services, as well as the marketing 
and selling thereof to existing customers. The development of both strategic and operational 
budgets ensures that the organisation shields long -term strategic priorities from the 
pressures to perform financially well over  the short term. The second step of the double -
loop process is the execution of management meetings (monthly or quarterly) to review 
strategy. Finally, a process for learning and adapting the strategy should be executed. 
Management should be alerted to eme rging strategies, new opportunities and risks, and 
adapt where necessary. Organisational learning is explained in more detail in Chapter 9.  
Principle 5: Mobilise leadership for change.  
Principles 1 to 4 focus on the BSC tool, framework and the processes that support it. 
Becoming a truly strategy -focused organisation, requires more than tools and processes. 
First, it requires ownership and the involvement of the executive team. Second, it requires 
change from virtually every part of the organisation. In Ch apter 2, (Section 2.3.1), it was 
indicated that to be considered ‘strategic', organisations cannot carry on what they were 
doing (ie business as usual). Furthermore, it was indicated that being ‘strategic’ is not a 
quick fix of small change - it requires a  large and sustained change effort over a long period 
of time. Initially, the focus should be on the mobilisation of leadership for change, to get 
the change process started. Once started, the focus shifts to governance to install the 
changes. A strategic management system evolves. This system will institutionalise the new 
cultural values and process into a new system for managing.  
In the section that follows we discuss, change as a fundamental strategy 
implementation issue is discussed in more detail.  
218 CHAPTER 8: STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION AS CHANGE MANAGEMENT  
LO 4:  Discuss  change  as afundamental  strategy implementation  element.  
8.4 Change - a fundamental strategy 
implementation element  
Change is an essential and inevitable feature of organisational life. Just as all biological 
organisms evolve and develop through time, organisations are also subject to change. There 
is general agreement that the rate and pace of change facing organisations are greater now 
than they have ever been. As a  verb, the term ‘change’ can be defined as the action to make 
the form, nature, content, or future course of something different from what it is or from 
what it would be if left alone.4 
As indicated in the previous section, being ‘strategic’ is not busines s as usual but 
requires large and sustained organisational change. Organisational change can be defined 
as ‘a process in which an organisation changes its working methods or aims. Sometimes, 
deep organisational change is necessary to maintain a competitive  advantage.5 Derived 
from this definition, we can define ‘strategic change’ as ‘deep’ organisational change. It 
involves changes to some or all of these features for instance:  
¦ the vision, mission, strategy, goals and objectives  
¦ the products and/or services  that it offers  
¦ the market to which it offers its products and/or services  
¦ the processes used to offer products and/or services  to the market  
¦ the technology used to offer products and/or serviced to the market  
¦ the values, corporate culture and/or shared beliefs  
¦ the outcomes of the way in which people work or its performance  
¦ the location (including internationalisation)  
¦ structure.  
Strategic change seeks to improve an organisation’s competitive position by improving 
certain of its features, for example, its  cost position or differentiation in terms of its 
product and/or service offerings. Thus, strategic change involves a change in the strategic 
direction of an organisation and the implementation of new strategies, involving major 
changes to the ‘normal’ or ‘previous’ routines in the organisation. Strategic change 
inadvertently causes change in other areas of the organisation, for example its structure, 
culture, systems, and technology to support its new strategic direction. The opening case 
study of this cha pter illustrates the successful implementation of Naspers’ strategy that 
necessitated various strategic changes. For example, the addition of book publishing to its 
operations in the 1920s was a major strategic change. Other examples are the addition of 
MNet and MWeb to its business, as well as acquiring a majority share in OLX as a 
foundation on which to build its online classifieds business segments.  
219  
PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
What makes strategic change complicated is that it often comprises a large number of 
small -scale changes within the larger strategic change programme. Internal factors 
(explained in Chapter 6), as well as external factors (explained in Chapter 5), are resulting 
in organisations reapp raising their strategies, structures and processes, all of which require 
them to implement and manage change. This is especially true in the wake of the worldwide 
recession that followed the global financial crises of 2007 -2008, coupled with rapid 
technolo gical advancements, which are causing organisations worldwide to question their 
traditional business models. In addition, each country has its own threats and opportunities, 
causing organisations to adjust their strategies, goals and plans. For example, in  South 
Africa, the National Minimum Wage Act came into force in Januaiy 2019.6 This Act will 
have an influence on the incentive systems of organisations, which may also lead to 
strategic changes. Business relationships may also bring about strategic change s. New 
alliances, mergers, acquisitions and other significant developments in the business arena 
may require substantial strategic changes in an organisation’s structure. Lastly, the 
strategic awareness and skills of managers and employees may also lead to  strategic 
change. Promotional expectations require strategic developments and growth in 
organisations, which require strategic changes. In the next section, the various types of 
strategic change will be addressed.  
Practising strategy: Fortune 500 firms 
1955 v 2017: Only 60 remain7 
Comparing the 1955 Fortune 500  companies to the 2017 Fortune 500,  there are only 60 
companies that appear on both lists. This means that fewer than 12 per cent of the 
Fortune 500  companies included in 1955 were still on the list 62 years later in 2017, and 
that 88 per cent of the companies from 1955 have either gone bankrupt, merged with 
(or were acquired by) other firms, or they still exist but have fallen from the top Fortune 
500 companies (ranked by total revenues). Many of the companies on the list in 1955 
are unrecognisable, forgotten companies today.  
What is the lesson to be learned from these statistics? Strategic change is 
inevitable, and it needs to be managed.  
LO 5:  Differentiate  between  the various  types  of strategic  change.  
8.5 Types of strategic change  
Strategic change can be classified according to two variables, namely, (1) the extent of the 
change required, and (2) the speed of the change that is to be achieved. In terms of the 
extent of the change required, we can differentiate between transformation and realignment. 
Transformation entails a change in organisational culture - a fundamental change that 
requires a change in the existing organisational paradigm.  
220 CHAPTER 8: STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION AS CHANGE MANAGEMENT  
Realignment does not involve a fundamental reappraisal of the central assumptions and 
beliefs in the organisation. In terms of the speed of change that is required, we can 
differentiate between incremental and ‘big bang’ change. Incremental change takes place 
over a long period of time but results in a fundamentally different organisation once 
completed. ‘Big bang’ change is usually forced, reactive change that occurs over a  short 
period of time. Based on these two variables {the extent of change and the speed of 
change), four different types of strategic change can materialise within organisations, as 
depicted in Figure 8.5.8 
 
Figure 8.5 Types of strategic change  
1. Evolution (transformation; incremental). Evolutionary change refers to 
transformational change that is implemented gradually (or incrementall y) through 
inter -related initiatives. This type of change is likely to be proactive, undertaken in 
anticipation of the need for future change. These changes are seen as opportunities for 
the organisation to improve, aspects such as project management techn iques that 
spread with use or improved administrative management processes. Since there is no 
pressing need for this type of change, it is often difficult to manage.  
2. Adaptation (realignment; incremental). Adaptation change refers to change  
undertaken to  realign the way in which the organisation operates. It is usually  
implemented in a series of steps. This type of change is most common in  
organisations and occurs incrementally according to changing circumstances.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
3. Revolution (transformation; ‘big bang’). This refers to transformational change that 
occurs through simultaneous initiatives relating to many aspects. Revolutionary 
change is usually forced and reactive because of a changing compet itive condition that 
an organisation is facing such as a potential takeover that threatens the existence of 
the organisation. Another example is when an information technology department fails 
an audit and immediate changes need to be made.  
4. Reconstruction (realignment; ‘big bang’). This refers to change undertaken to realign 
the way in which the organisation operates and involves many initiatives being 
implemented simultaneously. This type of change is usually forced because of a 
changing competitive positi on condition that an organisation is facing. Reconstruction 
may involve a good deal of disruption in an organisation. For example, a turnaround 
strategy may be implemented, followed by a major structural adjustment or a major 
cost-cutting programme may be implemented in reaction to declining financial 
performance or changing market conditions.  
LO 6:  Differentiate  between  the various  models  of planned change.  
8.6 Models of planned change  
In the previous section, we indicated that all organisations need to change. Some of these 
changes will be deliberate and planned by organisational leaders (in Chapter 12 we will 
differentiate between the role of leaders and managers in organisations), while others may 
be due to environmental pressures beyond their control.  For example, changes in production 
processes are planned, while changes in interest rates and the exchange rate may force 
many organisations to restructure and change. High streets around the globe have lost many 
well -known names and large -scale changes a re taking place across the public and private 
sectors in all countries. Change can therefore affect entire economies, organisations and the 
individuals employed by them.  
Most management models are founded on the notion that change can be viewed as a 
planne d activity that requires management. In this context, planned change can be defined 
as an approach to managing change that assumes that change is an activity that can be 
managed, organised and led by the senior management of an organisation. The notion tha t 
change can be viewed as a planned activity, is also based on the assumption that an 
organisation can move from one stable state to another. Models of planned change can be 
classified as either ‘best practice’ or ‘analytical’ models. Best practice models of planned 
change suggest that there is a recipe that can be learned for managing change successfully, 
while analytical models provide a framework to help explain the process of managing a 
change programme. It has to be recognised that change is a messy, v ery difficult and 
unpredictable process. In the section that follows, we will first focus on the best -practice 
models of planned change, after which the analytical models will be addressed.  
222 CHAPTER 8: STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION AS CHANGE  MANAGEMENT  
8.6.1  Best-practice models of planned change  
It would be difficult to find another area of management practice that is included in so 
many ‘how -to’ research papers and books as organisational change and management is. 
Each researcher has his or her o wn preferred approach to managing change and most 
advocate a number of steps that should be executed to achieve success. John Kotter9 is 
widely regarded as one of the leading experts in change management, and his eight -step 
change process is perhaps the be st-known best -practice model of planned change. The eight 
steps are discussed below.  
Kotter's eight -step change process Step 1: 
Establishing o sense of urgency  
This phase requires leaders to establish a need for change and create a sense of urgency 
around the need for change. In terms of strategy implementation, not changing would be a 
threat or a hindrance to the continued success of the organisation, and employees will have 
to be convinced of that in order to create a sense of urgency.  
Step 2: Creating the guiding coalition  
A guiding coalition is a group of individuals with the requisite knowledge, skills and 
attitudes to drive the change in the organisation. This group of people should act as change 
agents, where a change agent is defined as a person wi thin an organisation tasked with 
managing change. One of the key roles of the guiding coalition is to create and implement a 
roadmap for change. The coalition should be a good mix of individuals who complement 
one another.  
Step 3: Developing a change visio n 
The purpose of this step is to create a compelling vision for change that employees can buy 
into and that will mobilise them to change. Ideally, a change vision will emphasise the need 
for change and the aspirations of the organisation. Kotter provides g uidelines for a good 
change vision. It should provide a clear, compelling view of the future - in other words, it 
should be imaginable; it should appeal to the long -term interests of stakeholders and, 
accordingly, be desirable; it should be feasible, conta ining realistic and attainable goals; it 
should be focused and clear enough to provide guidance in decision -making; and it should 
be flexible, allowing individual initiative and alternative responses as conditions change; it 
must also be easy to communicat e and explain. In the strategic management process, 
determining the change vision and the broad roadmap for achieving it forms part of the 
strategy formation process.  
Step 4: Communicating the vision for buy -in 
Simply telling employees about change is not enough; they need to understand what it 
entails, why it is necessary, and why it will be beneficial. The change needs to be 
communicated consistently and on every possible platform. One of the most powerful tools 
in transmitting the vision is through the b ehaviours and words of leaders.  
223 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Step 5: Empowering brood -based action  
Existing and potential barriers to change must be removed and those responsible for driving 
change must be empowered  to do so. Barriers may include structural barriers, such as 
systems that are not aligned with the required change, and human barriers, such as 
resistance to change or a lack of skills.  
Step 6: Generating short -term wins  
Large -scale change, such as that needed for strategy implementation, can be a long process. 
To keep the momentum going, it is imperative to show some short -term results. Kotter 
suggests that this could take the form of setting performance goals that are aligned with the 
change, acknowledg ing and celebrating the attainment of such goals. Such successes 
generates further change.  
Step 7: Sustaining acceleration  
Given the long timelines and effort required to effect large -scale change, it is vital to 
ensure that the change process never stops and that the momentum is maintained. If this 
step is executed correctly and the change process is successful, this step will see many 
spontaneous examples of momentum becoming visible, such as new projects being initiated, 
efforts being made to keep urgenc y levels high, and employees being increasingly 
empowered.  
Step 8: Incorporating changes into the culture  
The most difficult aspect of change is changing the culture or mindset of the organisation, 
and this will take up most of the time. For this reason, it is seen as the last step and not the 
first step. In order to inculcate the change in the culture of the organisation, it must become 
part of the shared values and beliefs of the organisation. This could be accomplished in the 
following ways: proving tha t the new way is better than the old way; achieving visible 
success (for example, increased financial performance); accepting that some people may not 
accept the change and moving on; reinforcing new norms and values with incentives, 
rewards and promotions ; and reinforcing the culture with every new employee.  
Although best -practice models such as Kotter’s model, have attracted much attention 
and have many followers, they have also been criticised for adopting a unitary view of 
organisations that do not cons ider the unique context or circumstances of each organisation.  
8.6.2  Analytical models of planned change  
Theorists have devoted considerable attention to developing models that can contribute to 
our understanding of how change comes about and how it can be manag ed within a planned 
perspective, based on the unique situation and context of an organisation.  
224 CHAPTER 8: STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION AS CHANGE MANAGEMENT  
Analytical models suggest that change management programmes should proceed through 
various phases - they do not prescribe specific actions that managers should take. One of 
the most widely cited analytical models of planned change is that of Kurt Lewin, which 
identifies three stages as outlined below.10 
Lewin's change model 
Stage 1: Unfr eezing  
Most individuals will naturally resist change and will be inclined to maintain the status quo 
(the current state). For this reason, actively ‘unfreezing’ the status quo and readying the 
organisation for change is required. Unfreezing entails two cri tical elements or steps. First, 
current behaviours have to be carefully examined and employees have to be shown how 
necessary change is, and how the status quo is hindering organisational growth. Second, 
employees have to be informed of the imminent change , why it is necessary, what it will 
entail and how it will benefit them. During the unfreezing phase, communication is critical. 
The more employees know about the change, the better they understand why it is necessary 
and how it will affect them, the more they will be motivated to accept the change.  
Stage 2: Changing  
During this stage, the actual change rakes place, and for that reason (and due to the 
resistance to change that will accompany it), it is the most difficult phase of the change 
process. During this stage, employees need to start learning the new behaviours required of 
them, and they require a lot of support. This phase is characterised by employees acquiring 
new knowledge, skills and attitudes (for example, through training); organisational 
structures and systems changing; and effective communication throughout to maintain the 
momentum of change. Employees should be reminded why it is necessary and how it will 
benefit them.  
Stage 3: Freezing  
Once the change has been implemented, the challenge is to make it a permanent part of 
employee behaviour. It has to be solidified and entrenched in the organisation, and that is 
why Lewin called this phase ‘freezing’. This stage is essential to ensure that employees do 
not simply revert back to their old ways.  The change should, therefore, be made part of the 
performance management and reward systems.  
Balogun and Hope -Hailey's change kaleidoscope  
Based on Lewin’s model, Balogun and Hope -Hailey developed the change kaleidoscope, 
which is founded on the principle  that change needs to be context -specific and that the 
approach to change that the organisation chooses should be based on a thorough analysis of 
the following: (1) the context within which change is taking place and (2) a series of 
decisions around the wa y in which the change is to be managed. The model divides the 
context within which change takes place into eight core segments:"  
225 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
1. Power. The organisation needs to determine who the powerful stakeholders in 
relation to the change are. These could, for example, be the senior managers, 
labour union members and leaders, employees, customers, legislators, or 
suppliers.  
2. Time. The time available to effect the change should be determined. In  the event of 
a crisis, the range of options is limited, whereas if more time is available to 
implement the change, the range of options increases.  
3. Scope. The extent of the change in terms of its breadth and depth in the 
organisation should be determined.  
4. Preservation. The critical things that need to be maintained in the organisation 
through the change process and beyond should be identified. This could, for 
example, include the capabilities of senior and middle managers.  
5. Diversity. The diversity of the or ganisation should be determined. General 
dimensions of diversity are gender, age, marital status, physical ability and 
language. The diversity of the organisation will influence the change design.  
6. Capability. The capability and experience of the organisati on in terms of the 
management of change needs to be determined. Should managers be 
inexperienced, expertise from consultants may be needed.  
7. Capacity. The change process needs time, resources and people to be successful. 
Therefore, to ensure that the change  process succeeds, the organisation needs to 
determine its capacity in terms of time, people and other resources to devote to it.  
8. Readiness. Lastly, the readiness and attitude of those individuals affected by the 
change need to be determined.  
Based on the analysis of the context of the organisation change, Balogun and Hope - Hailey 
argued that those leading the change need to make key decisions around the way in which 
the change process will be managed. These decisions include:  
¦ Changing path. The first decis ion to make is whether the change will be 
incremental or transformational. Incremental change refers to small adjustments 
made towards a targeted end result. Incremental change does not have a 
significant impact on existing structures, neither does it alte r current methods. On 
the one hand, an example of an incremental change is the implementation of a new 
computer system to increase efficiency. A transformational change, on the other 
hand, refers to a shift in the culture of an organisation, resulting from  a change in 
the underlying strategy and processes that the organisation has used in the past. 
Transformational change is designed to be organisation -wide and is enacted over 
time.  
¦ Changing the start point. The second decision to make is whether the change  will 
be driven top -down by senior managers or bottom -up through employee 
suggestions. In practice, most managed change programmes are top -down, in other 
words, initiated and driven by senior managers and implemented by lower levels 
of employees.  
226 CHAPTER 8: STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION AS CHANGE MANAGEMENT  
¦ Changing style. This refers to the extent to which the change is coercive or 
directive versus participative and collaborative. A coercive style is associated 
with the phrase ‘do what I say and do it now', which is the opposite of a 
participative and collaborative change style, which welcomes input from 
employees.  
¦ Changing target. The target or purpose of the change needs to be determined. 
This can be either output (such as perform ance objectives), behaviours (changing 
the way in which people work), or values (a change in the core organisational 
values), or a combination of a change in output, behaviours and values.  
¦ Changing levers. Change levers refer to those interventions that ar e deployed in 
supporting the management of change. Examples of change levers are 
organisational structures, control systems and power structures.  
¦ Changing roles. The last decision to make is who should be responsible for 
managing the change in the organisa tion. This could be an individual, such as a 
manager, an external consultant or a delegated change agent or a team of people.  
The change kaleidoscope model recognises that it is virtually impossible to map all 
contextual variables with any one best -practic e approach. It acknowledges the need to 
account for a wide range of organisational situations.  
It is important to note that the pace of change in contemporary organisations is such 
that change is a constant state that requires managing, which leaves little  or, sometimes, 
even no time for recovery (or freezing/sustaining) in between. Also, change often emerges 
in an unplanned and non -linear manner as a result of changes in the external environment. 
Change may also develop bottom -up, as people, sometimes unco nsciously change the way 
that they work overtime, to become more effective and efficient. Change can therefore also 
be seen as an open -ended process of adaptation and organisational learning, which will be 
addressed in more detail in Chapter 9.  
The followi ng practising strategy box provides an excellent example of changes 
taking place in a mining company, showing how it was managed successfully.  
Practising strategy: Cynthia Carroll, CEO of 
Anglo American (2007 -2013)12 
Anglo American pic is a multi -national mining company based in Johannesburg, South 
Africa and London, United Kingdom. It is the world's largest producer of platinum, with 
around 40 per cent of world output, as well as being a major producer of diamonds, 
copper, nickel, iron ore and metallurgica l and thermal coal. In 2007, Cynthia Carroll was 
appointed as CEO of the company, the first outsider (non -South African) to manage 
what was a very top -down, male -dominated, hierarchical business.  
227 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICA N CONTEXT  
Carroll always had the view that safety is a key indicator of rigour and discipline in an 
organisation. For the five years prior to Caroll's appointment, Anglo had been losing 
about 45 people to fatalities every year. Consequently, she started with safety. In 2007, 
her first year as chief executive, Carroll went to Anglo's Rustenburg platinum mining 
operation in South Africa, a key part of the company's global activities. Within hours of 
her visit, she was told that one of the workers had been k illed at the mine. She was told 
at the end of the day that they had yet another fatality. She gave orders to shut down 
the mine complex, to assess the infrastructure and the standards, and to work to retrain 
people. She also gave instructions that people w ould only be returning to work once 
they feel confident that they would be working in safe conditions. It was a bold 
decision that affected around 28,000 workers. Carroll knew she would have to gain 
allies to support her safety campaign within the wider in dustry, the unions, and the 
government. Workers felt scared, threatened by the decision, and resisted the change. 
Although Carroll felt confident that she made the right decision by making the change, 
mine managers did not support her. At the same time, th e company had been 
transitioning from a largely South African company, to a global company. Carroll also 
needed to make another change by taking out a layer of people reporting to her. 
Strategic changes lead to changes in the embedded culture and organisat ional 
hierarchy. During these changing times, Carroll spent a lot of time with external 
stakeholders, shareholders and never received resistance to change from the 
shareholders - they understood the reasons and ultimate benefits for implementing the 
change s. Also, communications and relationships with labour unions were very good - 
Carroll never had a major walkout and the company never experienced a strike because 
they had built a trusting relationship between all parties.  
During her tenure, Carroll had to  confront the threat of a takeover, a downturn 
in the commodity cycle, and criticism of her environmental record and strategy 
decisions, notably, Anglo's investment in Minas Rio, a Brazilian iron ore project that 
went into operation four years late and at twice the original budget. Minas Rio is a tier -
one asset and was identified as a potential acquisition before she was even appointed 
as CEO. But the fact was, Anglo had to deal with changes that neither they nor the 
industry anticipated in Brazil, in the r egulatory environment. These changes delayed 
the project. Eventually, Carroll needed to make tough decisions, not all popular. For 
example, she had to reduce the number of people. Eventually, these decisions paid off. 
The company delivered US$3.2 billion o f value over and above their committed number 
of US$2 billion. They had a clear strategy - they were joined up. They reduced the 
number of fatalities by about 70 per cent and that cascaded down into the industry, 
where a 50 per cent reduction was achieved.  That's a great accomplishment.  CHAPTER 8: STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION AS CHANGE MANAGEMENT  
LO 7:  Explain  the barriers  to successful  strategic  change  and ways  to overcome  them.  
8.7 Barriers to successful strategic change and 
ways to overcome them  
Despite all the research in the field of change management, evidence continues to suggest 
that most change efforts fail to meet their objectives.12 Some of the reasons for the failure 
of change efforts, and ways to overcome them, are explained below.  
8.7.1  Lack of strategic planning and leadership  
A lack of strategic planning and leadership, including a failure to look ahead and anticipate 
the impact of external environmental changes on the organisation, is a major barrier to 
successful strategic change. In chan ge programmes, it could also happen that the leadership 
of the organisation has different ideas about the change target, path, and style to the rest of 
the management team or the employees. Leadership will then work towards the change they 
think is require d, but will be undermined by the rest of the organisation, who do not have 
the same view of the strategic direction. For this reason, widespread communication and 
participation are critical in any change process.  
Trust is another key issue - if there is a lack of trust between leaders and other 
factions in the organisation (for example, labour unions), this may have a negative effect 
on any change effort. To overcome this barrier, the context of the change should be 
evaluated (refer to Section 8.6.1 in whic h Balogun and Hope -Hailey’s change kaleidoscope 
is explained). Furthermore, open debate and discussions among top management and all 
other levels of management and leadership should be ensured.  
8.7.2  Structural reasons  
Where the organisational structure does not  support the change required, the change 
programme can fail. For example, the managers in the organisation may not have the skills 
and mindset required to operate in a digital environment. If this is the case, large -scale 
restructuring and the appointment of new managers with the right mindset will be required.  
Structure should always follow strategy, and a change in strategy should be 
followed up with a change in structure.  
8.7.3  Cultural reasons  
Where the change requires a paradigm shift that is far removed fro m the current paradigm, 
changing the culture of the organisation may be too difficult or too time -consuming. This 
may lead to the failure of the change programme. It may also lead to other consequences 
that will affect the outcome of the change programme.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
The existing paradigm of the organisation may be so strong that change initiatives are 
simply reinterpreted to fit within the old paradigm. Strategy and culture should always be 
aligned. To  overcome this barrier, a new and supportive organisational that supports the 
strategic change, should be identified.  
8.7.4  System reasons  
Where current systems are set up to support a specific paradigm, a change in paradigm 
might mean that the current systems s imply become inadequate to deal with the changes. 
Remember that systems in this instance refer to technical systems (such as information 
and communication technology systems) and also to business processes, such as 
performance management and reward systems . To overcome this barrier, systems should 
be redesigned and realigned with the changed strategy.  
8.7.5  Process reasons  
Some reasons inherent in the way the change process is managed, may cause it to  
fail. These reasons include:  
¦ Lack of communication. Communication is vital to the success of any change 
process and most organisations fail to communicate effectively. To overcome 
this barrier, the first thing to consider is what the aim of the communication is, 
for example, raising awareness of the need fo r change, disseminating factual 
information about the change, persuading people to make the change, seeking 
their views or acknowledging their contributions. Second, the timing of 
communication before, during and after a change programme is crucial to its 
success. Third, the target of the communication needs to be determined. In other 
words, the receiver of the communication needs to be specified, for example, all 
employees or only specified groups such as a department. Fourth, the sender of 
the communicati on needs to be identified, for example, the chief executive 
officer or financial manager. Next, the communication medium should be 
identified. The choices include verbal or written communication. Lastly, the 
content and context of the communication should be determined, where the 
content refers to what information should be included, and the context refers to 
other important information relevant to employees. The latter should be carefully 
considered by management because it affects the resistance to change  by 
employees. For example, will the change affect the job security of employees, or 
will employees be expected to relocate to other cities because of the change. 
Communication methods that can be used during changes programmes are (in 
order of frequency o f use) to cascade information via line managers, to hold 
departmental meetings, to send emails and personal letters from top management 
and the human resources department, to organise all employee meetings, to post 
on the intranet, to hold training session s, and to communicate via notice boards 
and video conferencing.  
230 CHAPTER 8: STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION AS CHANGE MANAGEMENT  
¦ Time management. This relates to failure to design and implement change quickly 
enough to keep up with competitors  or with customer demands. To overcome this 
barrier, managers and employees need to manage the time spent on planning, 
implementing and controlling change programmes effectively.  
¦ Not dealing with resistance. People may resist change and not dealing with 
resistance to change or brushing it off may lead to an escalation in resistance. 
For this reason, it is essential to encourage dialogue and debate and to deal with 
resistance as soon as possible. Again, communication may help people to 
understand why change is necessary. Also, making people more involved and 
supporting them in the change programme, may also reduce their resistance to 
change. Incentives and rewards may also be used to reduce resistance.  
¦ Reinforcing mechanisms. Not building reinforcing mechanisms into the change 
programme so that the changes do not become embedded can be a major barrier 
to successful strategic change. Therefore, care should be taken to embed strategic 
changes in the organisation.  
8.7.6  Resource reasons  
The organisation may fai l to devote enough resources in terms of time, money and human 
resources to managing, implementing and sustaining the change. To overcome this barrier, 
the organisation should budget adequately for these resources.  
The big picture  
In this chapter, strategy  implementation as change management were addressed. Strategy 
implementation was first distinguished from strategy formation, after which various 
barriers to successful strategy implementation were explained. Then, the various principles 
to overcoming thes e barriers were addressed. The second part of the chapter focused on 
change as a fundamental strategy implementation element. The various types of strategic 
change were explained, followed by an explanation of the various models of planned 
strategic change . Lastly, barriers to successful strategic change and ways to overcome them 
were discussed.  
Summary of learning outcomes  
LO 1: Explain strategy implementation and differentiate between strategy 
formation and implementation.  
Strategy formation is the planning phase of strategic management which involves setting 
the strategic direction of the organisation, analysing the internal and external  
231 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
environment, setting strategic goals, and developing and choosing the strategies that will 
help them attain strategic goals. Strategy implementation refers to the process during which 
the organisation draws on both human and non -human factors in the organisation to ensure 
that the strategy is exec uted in line with the plans devised during the strategic planning 
phase.  
LO 2: Explain the various barriers to successful strategy 
implementation.  
Four main barriers to strategy implementation can be identified: the people, vision, 
management and resources . 
LO 3: Explain the principles of strategy implementation.  
In order to overcome the barriers to successful strategy implementation, five principles of 
strategy implementation are highlighted:  
Principle 1: Translating the strategy into operational terms  
Principle 2: Aligning the organisation to its corporate strategy  
Principle 3: Making strategy everybody’s everyday job  
Principle 4: Viewing strategy as a continual process  
Principle 5: Mobilising leadership for change.  
LO 4: Discuss change as a fundamental  strategy implementation element.  
Strategic change is deep organisational change which seeks to improve an organisation’s 
competitive position by improving certain of its key features. It involves a change in the 
strategic direction of an organisation and the implementation of new strategies, involving 
major changes to the normal or previous routines.  
LO 5: Differentiate between the various types of strategic change.  
Strategic change can be classified according to two variables, namely, the extent of the 
change required and the speed of the change that is to be achieved. Based on this, four 
types of strategic change can be found in organisations:  
Evolutionary change. Transformational change that is implemented gradually (or 
incrementally) through inter -related initiatives.  
Adaptation. Change undertaken to realign the way in which the organisation operates.  
Revolution. Transformational change that occurs through simultaneous initiatives in 
many aspects.  
Reconstruction. Change undertaken to realign the way in  which the organisation 
operates with many initiatives implemented simultaneously.  
232 CHAPTER 8: STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION AS CHANGE MANAGEMENT  
LO 6: Differentiate between the various models of planned change.  
Models of planned change can be classified as ‘best practice’ or ‘analytical’ models.  
Kotter’s model is an example of a best practice model of planned change, consisting 
of eight steps, while the models of Lewin and Balogun and Hope -Hailey are examples of 
analytical models.  
Change can  also take place in an unplanned way. It can develop bottom -up and can 
be seen as an open -ended process of adaptation and organisational learning. The latter will 
be discussed in detail in Chapter 9.  
LO 7: Explain the barriers to successful strategic chang e and ways to overcome 
them.  
The main barriers are a lack of strategic planning and leadership, structural reasons, 
cultural reasons, system reasons, process reasons and resources reasons.

management logic  . Organisational learning  
Discovery started out as a medical aid with an innovative loyalty and 
rewards programme (Vitality) to help their clients live healthier lives. 
Healthier clients meant lower medical expenses for Discovery and 
more rewards to the clients - a win -win situation. Discovery has 
subsequently used this model lo expand into other businesses such as 
life insurance, short -term insurance, and in 2019, a retail bank, 
applying what it has learned across a range of businesses.  
What is clear from this, is that an organisation like Discovery 
would not have been as successful without its ability to adapt to 
changing conditions and stakeholder requirements.  
Sources of competitive advantage will alter over time and the 
ability to learn  and adapt is arguably the only sustainable competitive 
advantage. In the previous chapter, we explored the processes of 
planned change (change management). However, change does not 
always occur in a deliberate and managed way. In fact, we could argue 
that most change happens inorganically as individuals and 
organisations learn and adapt to their environment.   
 
 
In this chapter, we explore the idea of learning organisations and the  
importance of organisational learning in innovation and change. In our  
exploration of organisational learning, we accept the following 
principles:  
1. Learning takes place primarily at the individual level.  
2. Organisational learning takes place as information is  
shared and meaning is created by means of interactions  
between individuals, technology and processes.  
Organisational learning is advantageous because it enables  
organisations to adapt to their environment and to innovate.  3.

Case study  
Discovery - Innovation in the blood1 
Discovery, a South African insurance group, built their success on questioning the 
fundamental rules of the industry game they operate in.  
Three lifestyle choices (smoking, poor nutrition, and poor physical activity) 
contribute to four conditions (diabetes, cancer, h eart disease, and lung disease) that cause 
over 50 per cent of deaths each year. So, if you can get people to be healthier, you can 
offer more sustainable insurance. With their Vitality programme, Discovery reasoned that 
by helping people make healthier ch oices, they could reduce their health risks and they 
could offer them rewards and lower premiums.  
236 CHAPTER 9: THE LEARNING ORGANISATION  
Today, Vitality is a complete wellness system that tracks everything from physical activity 
to nutrition over the course of a person's life. The Vitality programme is a source of great 
advantage to Discovery. For example, Vitality subscribers log 70,000 gym visits per day.  
Discovery keeps on innovating. In 2001, Discovery Life was introduced on the same 
basis, and soon became the number -one provider of life insurance in South Africa. The 
company developed the Vitality Drive programme for their short -term insurance business, 
which rewards customers for responsible driving.  
How do they do it? According  to Adrian Gore, founder and CEO of Discovery, their 
leaders are always on a treadmill to create and launch new ideas: '...every year we have a 
rock -star launch where we’re presenting something new to thousands of our intermediaries 
who own sales. Our guys  know the date is booked. The concert's happening. You just better 
write the music’.  
To drive the company towards the next idea, there is an internal competition every 
year called Inspiring Excellence, where the top one thousand leaders break into teams of  
two to four people and work on new concepts. The ideas are narrowed down to the top five 
teams, who then present at the annual management conference. The programme provides a 
strong inventory of ideas, and are continually replenished.  
Twice a year, the re muneration committee gives each business an innovation score, 
which influences their remuneration. Beyond this, all employees are involved in the time - 
based cycle of innovation, working on projects. Across the organisation, there is a natural 
rhythm of in novation.  
Innovation is about learning and constantly questioning the status quo, elements that 
the Discovery leadership have made part of the organisation's lifeblood.  
LO 1:  Explain  what  a learning  organisation  is. 
9.1 What is a learning organisation?  
While we can agree that knowledge and organisational learning are important concepts for 
the success and survival of organisations, it is also important to think about how 
organisational learning takes place. Firstly, we should understand that individuals learn,  
not organisations. The process thus starts with individuals learning. The next phase in the 
process is where learning is shared with other members in the organisation until it becomes 
commonly accepted practice or knowledge.  PRACTISING S TRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT

 >¦ other members  
 
Figure 9.2 Organisational learning  
Perhaps the most important phase is when the learning is applied to strategic decisions and 
management practices in the organisation. At this point, it starts becoming an 
organisational capability, and organisational capabilities are important building blocks of 
competitive advantage. Application of knowledge also creates new learning opportunities, 
and once again, the assimilation of this learning in the organisation will lead to the further 
development  of knowledge and capabilities. This process is depicted in Figure 9.2  
From Figure 9.1 we can see that organisational learning is continuous (all members 
of an organisation should be learning and adapting every day in a never - ending cycle) and 
experimenta l, because the acquisition of knowledge does not provide guarantees that 
mistakes will not be made. Making mistakes or figuring out what works or does not work in 
different situations is an important part of learning.  
While we can agree that organisational  learning is conceptually important, can we 
see the evidence of organisational learning leading to organisational success? In the case of 
Discovery, we can see that the organisation managed to develop a successful global 
business, but is being a learning o rganisation the only driver of its success? Perhaps we 
should ask the question the other way around: what would happen if organisations did not 
learn and adapt? Clearly, many organisations would fail if they were unable to adjust to 
environmental changes, which occur often, as we will see in the next section. In addition, 
such organisations would simply not be able to benefit from innovation because there 
would be none. So, we can argue that being a learning organisation could lead to at least 
three benefit s: 
1. Being able to adapt more quickly to environmental changes through more flexible 
and agile strategic responses.  
2. Being able to benefit from opportunities and sensing and reacting to threats 
earlier than competitors, leading to superior performance.  
3. Being able to apply newly acquired knowledge to business problems and 
opportunities, leading to innovation.  CHAPTER 9: THE LEARNING ORGANISATION  
Alone or in combination, these benefits would provide any learning organisation with a 
compet itive advantage. However, becoming a learning organisation is not easy. Several 
barriers to organisational learning exist, as discussed below.  
LO 2:  Explain  the barriers  to organisational  learning.  
9.2 Barriers to organisational learning  
If organisational learning is so important to the success and survival of organisations, why 
are so few organisations truly good at it? Some of the reasons are discussed below.  
9.2.1  Dominant general management logic  
Dominant general management logic stems from the way managers c onceptualise their 
business. It is a set of broad (often flawed) assumptions that can be thought of as a 
structure (in the case of diversified businesses, there may be multiple dominant logics). 
Managers make critical decisions about the strategy and alloc ation of resources based on 
this, and the more ‘dominant’ the logic, the more it acts as a barrier to learning and change. 
In effect, the dominant management logic acts as a filter, meaning that executives will only 
see or focus on data from the environmen t that is deemed relevant by the dominant 
management logic. Unlearning must take place to pave the way for new learning and new 
mental models, and allow new dominant logic to be established.2 
Ironically, the more successful an organisation is, the more dif ficult it often is to 
change its dominant logic, as one of the dangers of dominant management logic is that 
executives in an organisation will assume that the future is essentially an extension of the 
past, and will ignore any information to the contrary.  
For example, very few of the leading film camera manufacturers, such as Polaroid, 
are also market leaders in the digital camera age. We could argue that their dominant logic 
prevented them from making the transition to a fundamentally new technology in dig ital 
cameras and a new dominant logic.  
9.2.2  Management ignorance  
Quite often managers in an organisation assume that they know all there is to know about 
their business and the industry in which they operate, and there is accordingly no need to 
learn anymore. I n this instance, ignorance  and arrogance  can be regarded as barriers to 
learning.3 
9.2.3  Limits to absorptive capacity  
Absorptive capacity refers to the ability of an organisation to recognise the value of new, 
external information, to assimilate it and to use i t to address business problems.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
 
Figure 9.4 The experiential learning cycle  
LO 4:  Explain  the transfer  of knowledge  to others.  
9.4 Transferring knowledge to others  
Knowledge is broadly categorised as being explicit or tacit. Explicit knowledge  is knowledge 
that can be written down or told to someone. For example, you can explain to someone how 
to get on a bicycle, how the pedals work and how the brakes work (although this will not 
necessarily mean that the person can then ride the bicycle). Tacit knowledge  consists of 
personal beliefs, values and perspectives that people take for granted and that may be much 
more difficult to communicate.  
While the two are quite often thought of as separate categories, it is perhaps more 
accurate to think of them as a continuum because often knowledge has aspects of both. 
Sometimes, the explicit aspect may be a much bigger component than the tacit, and other 
times, the reverse may be true. For example, complex tasks such as negotiating a merger 
between compani es may consist mostly of tacit knowledge, while simpler tasks, such as 
operating a cash register, may consist mainly of explicit knowledge. This is illustrated in 
Figure 9.5.

socialisation, combination, internalisation and articulation.7 These types of knowledge 
transfer are discussed below. Most types of knowledge are quite complex, and more than 
one type of transfer mechanism may be involved in conveying the full set of knowl edge, 
skills and attitudes needed for a certain task:  
1. Socialisation (tacit —? tacit). This takes  place when  tacit knowledge is  
transferred from one person to another,  but remains  tacit. Behaviour is  
often learned by observing and imitating other people (th ink, for example, of a 
child mimicking her mother’s behaviour), and, in the same way, managers and 
employees can learn certain behaviours when exposed to more experienced 
colleagues. For instance, a junior manager may learn by observing the CEO, 
finance di rector and legal representatives in action during merger negotiations.  
2. Combination (explicit —? explicit). This takes place when  explicit knowledge  
is mixed and shared. For example, when  experienced  machine operators  
decide to write a how -to manual for younger and more inexperienced employees 
to avoid having to tell them again and again what to do, they are combining and 
transferring their explicit knowledge to their colleagues.  
3. Internalisation (explicit —? tacit). When explicit knowledge is used so ofte n 
that it becomes part of the being of the person using it, it has become tacit 
knowledge. For example, when learning to drive, a person needs to be instructed 
on what to do and how to do it, but after a while, driving becomes almost 
automatic, in other wo rds, it becomes an internalised skill.  
4. Articulation (tacit —> explicit). When an attempt is made to convert tacit 
knowledge to explicit knowledge to share it with colleagues, articulation is used. 
For example, a course in strategic management is an effort to teach a skill that is 
often tacit rather than explicit.

LO 5:  Explain  how  an organisation  can become  a learning  organisation.  
9.5 Becoming a learning organisation  
Organisational learning is not as easy as putting in place a few people, processes and 
technologies. It requires a deep -seated change in the way the organisation and its leaders 
view the world. The following mechanisms, to be used in combination, are proposed to 
assist an organis ation to become a learning one:  
9.5.1  Leadership commitment to learning  
Problems within an organisation generally begin with top management and filter down, as 
does success. Thus, to generate a culture of organisational learning, leaders should 
demonstrate their  own commitment by being models of learning, championing learning and 
using learning strategically for business results. In the case of Discovery, the innovation 
process was led by the founder and CEO, Adrian Gore.  
9.5.2  Building shared visions  
Leaders need to develop genuine visions (not just pieces of paper) that can inspire 
employees. Visions cannot be dictated to employees; employees must believe and buy into 
them. Genuine shared visions will inspire employees in good times and bad, and have the 
power to bin d an organisation together for the long term.  
It is also important to empower people towards a collective vision, not only by 
involving them in setting the vision, but also by distributing responsibility in such a way 
that people are motivated to lean towa rd what they are being accountable to achieve. In the 
case of Discovery, the top 1,000 leaders are all part of the innovation and learning process, 
and all employees work on innovation projects. Because employees took part in this, they 
also bought into it . 
9.5.3  Encouraging diversity  
People from similar backgrounds, for example, similar cultural groups and similar 
education, tend to see things in a similar way. Quite often, if the top management team is 
too similar in their backgrounds, it is easier for them to get caught up in a dominant 
management logic, and much more difficult to change. For this reason, diversity (for 
example, in terms of age, cultural background, educational background and gender) in the 
organisation and, specifically, in the top management team, should be encouraged. The 
more people have divergent views, the more they are likely to influence one another’s 
mental models and effect change.  
244 CHAPTER 9: THE LEARNING ORGANISATION  
9.5.4  Encouraging double -loop learning  
Single -loop learning occurs when individuals or organisations strive to achieve a goal and 
when they fail, they evaluate what went wrong. They may then try a different strategy, fail 
again, evaluate again, and so on, until they run out of ideas. This persisting failur e may 
push the individual or the organisation into a situation in which the fundamental elements 
or rules governing the situation are questioned, causing them to re -evaluate their own 
mental models - the goals, values and beliefs they hold.8 This questioni ng of the 
fundamental underlying assumptions is known as double -loop learning.  
Challenging existing mental models is critical for a learning organisation, since our 
mental models can prevent new powerful insights and organisational practices from 
becoming a reality. The process of unlearning mental models begins with self reflection 
which enables us to develop an understanding of our deeply held beliefs and 
generalisations, and how they influence the way we do things. Until we are prepared to 
challenge our own mental models, real change cannot take place. In the case of Discovery, 
double -loop learning was evident when the company challenged the long -held belief that 
drove the medical insurance industry and understood that by helping their customers to live 
healthier lives, the company and the customer could benefit.  
9.5.5  Developing systems thinking abilities  
Systems thinking refers to the ability to see the ‘big picture’, and to see patterns rather 
than isolated events. Systems thinking means that as an organisati on, we understand how 
we are connected to the world, how we fit into our environment, how we are influenced by 
it and how we can influence it in turn.  
9.5.6  Encouraging individual and team learning  
Being committed to lifelong learning is an important element of a learning organisation. 
Learning should be incorporated into work so that people can be trained on the job, while 
ample opportunities should be provided for ongoing education and growth. Peter Senge 
promotes the idea of personal mastery by focusing on bec oming the best person possible 
and striving for a sense of commitment and excitement in our careers to facilitate the 
realisation of our potential. Encouraging top managers to enrich their experience bases, for 
example, through sabbaticals and educational experiences, and rehearsing as a management 
team for a broad range of future industry scenarios are examples of such individual 
learning opportunities.9 
Peter Senge also emphasises the importance of team learning. Modern organisations 
operate based on team work, which means that organisations cannot learn if team members 
do not come together and learn. This process requires teams to develop the ability to create 
desired results, to have a goal in mind and to work together to attain it.10 
245 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
9.5.7  Legitimising dissent  
Thinking is not the exclusive domain of top managers. In learning organisations, everybody 
should think and contribute ideas, and to this end, employees should be encouraged to 
question  key business practices and assumptions. A culture of dialogue and debate is very 
important in a learning organisation. It is also important to encourage double -loop learning 
since it allows employees to challenge the mental models that organisations use i n their 
decision -making.  
9.5.8  Encouraging experimentation  
Few people learn how to ride a bicycle without falling off several times. In fact, falling off 
and getting back up is an important part of the process, and in organisations, it is no 
different. Without f ailure, there is no learning. For this reason, it is important to encourage 
experimentation and to see the failures for what they are - learning opportunities. Prahalad 
and Bettis suggest that the economic evaluation of the organisation be separated from 
managerial evaluation, so that managers can be rewarded for experimenting, even when 
projects are unsuccessful.11 
9.5.9  Establishing communities of practice  
Communities of practice (CoPs) are the building blocks of learning systems. In our opening 
case study about Discovery, we saw how they used the idea of communities of practise 
creating management teams to work on innovative ideas. The idea of CoPs closely fits 
Senge’s notion of ‘team learning’.12 CoPs can also exist across organisational boundaries. 
For ex ample, a CoP on procurement practices may include suppliers and academics from 
outside the organisation.  
One of the key roles of a CoP is to define what competence entails in its context, 
and there are three elements:13 
There must be a sense of joint enter prise,  meaning that members of the CoP need to 
have a shared understanding of what their community is about and how they can contribute 
to it. Members must be accepted and trusted, and able to interact with other members of the 
community. In other words, t here should be relationships of mutuality.  The community will, 
over time, develop a shared repertoire  of stories, language, routines, rituals and processes, 
and the knowledge of how to use these appropriately. The value of CoP for organisations 
occurs when  sharing of information takes place across the boundaries of the CoPs, either 
between individuals or with other CoPs as a whole. This can happen in the following 
ways:14 
¦ People may form part of more than one community or be in a position to act as 
brokers between CoPs. For example, a manager in an organisation may be a part -
time student at a leading business school, and, accordingly, may be able to act as 
a bridge between CoPs.  
246  
CHAPTER 9: THE LEARNING ORGANISATION  
¦ Artefacts, such  as documents, tools, processes and discourses, may act as bridges 
between CoPs. For example, the findings of a research project conducted by 
academics at a university may be used by a CoP in an organisation.  
¦ Interaction can be a means of exchanging information directly between CoPs. For 
example, a conference on a specialised topic may attract business managers, 
consultants and academics representing several CoPs.  
It is important for organisations to understand the role that CoPs can play in a learnin g 
organisation.  
9.5.10  Collaboration  
Collaboration with suppliers, customers and, even competitors, is becoming a more and 
more common means of fostering learning in organisations. However, it does require a 
specific mindset - organisations that cannot or will not trust their collaboration partners or 
share openly will not be able to learn. In the case of Discovery, they made customers their 
innovation partners by digitally gleaning information about customers’ lifestyle choices and 
preferences and assimilating that into their wellness programme. Rather than just tolerating 
collaboration, collaboration should be valued and rewarded.  
Practising strategy: Philip Morris to quit 
smoking?15 
Considering the increasing evidence of the harmful nature of cigarette smoke, Philip 
Morris International (PMI), one of the world's biggest tobacco companies, launched 
the Foundation for a Smoke -Free World, claiming that it wants to see a future in 
which people will stop smoking its cigarettes. The company sees its future in e -
cigar ettes and other smoke -free nicotine delivery systems, which it believes will 
drastically cut cigarette consumption. Anti -tobacco campaigners, however, were 
highly sceptical, pointing out that PMI had not stopped marketing cigarettes, and until 
they do so, their claims cannot be taken seriously.  
PMI is collaborating with Derek Yach, a former senior figure at the World 
Health Organisation responsible for the launch of its global tobacco control treaty. 
According to Yach: 7 have been working with PMI to establ ish a foundation to accelerate 
the end of smoking and tackle the consequences for tobacco farmers. From the start, the 
intent has been to create an independent foundation that meets the very highest standards 
of legal and ethical norms and that addresses s cientific verification in innovative and 
needed ways'.  
While only time will tell whether PMI is serious about its claims, it is clear 
that the company is questioning its own reason for existence and some of the 
fundamental assumptions about its markets.  
247 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
9.5.11  Knowledge management  
Knowledge management  is ‘[t]he management function that creates or locates knowledge, 
manages the flow of knowledge within the organisation and ensures that the know ledge is 
used effectively and efficiently for the long -term benefit of the organisation’.16 In other 
words, it is a management system that shares organisational knowledge and supports 
organisational learning. The creation of an efficient knowledge manageme nt system can 
contribute to the creation of a learning organisation.  
The process of knowledge management consists of the following four phases:  
1. The discovery of knowledge in the organisation  
2. Capturing the knowledge in a way that enables it to be shared across departments 
or other organisational units  
3. Sharing knowledge throughout the organisation  
4. Applying knowledge to solve business problems and make decisions.  
The nature of a basic knowledge management system is depicted in Figure 9.6.  
Knowledge acquisition  
 
 (new and existing)

Figure 9.6 A knowledge management system  
248 CHAPTER 9: THE LEARNING ORGANISATION  
Knowledge acquisition  
Existing knowledge in an organisation is constantly supplemented by knowledge obtained 
through external and internal scanning, and the addition of new employees with new 
knowledge. It can also be expanded through training and developm ent. 
Knowledge (new and existing)  
Knowledge is the sum of information in the organisation, consisting of both existing 
knowledge and new knowledge, which is constantly being added by environmental scanning 
and recruitment activities.  
Capturing knowledge  
Some knowledge, such as training or product manuals, may be explicit and easy to capture, 
but much of the strategically useful knowledge may be much harder to capture. It could be 
argued that it will be impossible to capture all the tacit knowledge associate d with a 
project. For example, a consulting project team may capture the steps they took in a 
complicated client project, describing the tools they used, the steps they followed and the 
presentations they made. However, it will be virtually impossible to d escribe exactly how 
they dealt with the negotiation process, difficult clients and internal politics on the client 
site.  
Organising knowledge  
The purpose of this phase is to consolidate the knowledge and to capture it in a format and 
language that will be usable throughout the organisation.  
Sharing knowledge  
Knowledge is of little value unless it is shared across different teams and departments, as a 
precursor to being used.  
Using knowledge  
The crux of knowledge management is to enable the organisation and its members to use 
the knowledge in a business setting to solve problems, improve business performance and 
deal effectively with opportunities and threats in the external environment.  
Knowledge management systems  
Information technology plays an increasingl y important role in knowledge management 
systems as it enables their processes to take place, while, in turn, being populated and 
enabled by them. There is a myriad of different technologies that may be useful during 
each of the phases of the knowledge man agement process.  
249  
PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Practising strategy: Codify or personalise? 
Different strategies for managing knowledge  
Because of the need to capture the methodologies they use in different projects; 
consulting firms have traditionally been at the forefront of knowledge management. In 
a Harvard Business Review  article, Morten Hansen, Nitin Noria and Thomas Tierney17 
found that there were two distinct models for knowledge management in consulting 
firms. In one model, the consulting team captured the knowledge in a document 
format, which was then shared with the rest of the firm through electronic means. 
This approach was des cribed as the ’codification' approach. The other approach was 
based more on personal contact, with consultants finding and interviewing other 
consultants with relevant experience to devise a new methodology. This was 
described as the ‘personalisation’ appr oach. The authors suggested that the two 
approaches could not be easily combined and that care should be taken in selecting 
the best approach.  
The big picture  
Strategic innovation and change is the goal of organisational learning. Without the ability 
to learn, these goals would not be achievable. However, organisational learning begins with 
the individual and his or her own ability to learn and change. From the individual, it moves 
to teams as individuals share their knowledge and insights and their teams  apply the new 
insights to business problems. As teams apply new knowledge successfully, they may share 
the knowledge with the rest of the organisation for wider application.  
From our discussion above, we may argue that there are three building blocks for a 
learning organisation18 (see Figure 9.7). The first building block is an environment that 
supports and encourages learning.  For example, legitimising dissent and encouraging 
experimentation are actions that create an organisational pace in which learning  is not only 
tolerated, but actively encouraged. Second, the organisation also needs to establish formal 
processes to share knowledge systematically.  Communities - of-practice and knowledge 
management systems are examples of activities that will form this b uilding block. The third 
building block is leadership  which actively stimulates dialogue and debate and encourages 
learning.  
250 CHAPTER 9: THE LEARNING ORGANISATION  
 
Figure 9.7 The building blocks of a learning organisation  
What we see from this chapter is that organisational learning is not a simple process. It 
may lead to success, but the journey will not be easy. A  lot of thinking is required by 
management to instil a culture of learning. Even then it may fail, but if it works, the effects 
may be spectacular. It is evident from the chapter case study that Discovery increased their 
revenues and competitive advantage by applying the principles of organisational learning 
in their innovation efforts.  
Summary of learning outcomes  
LO 1: Explain what a learning organisation is.  
Just like human beings need to learn and adapt to their environment in order to succeed, 
organisations need to be able to do the same. In this chapter, we saw that organisational 
learning is dependent on the ability of the organisation to acquire, transform and use 
knowledge.  
LO 2: Explain the barriers to organisational learning.  
Just as human  learning is often hindered by various factors such as the limited ability of 
individuals, or the environment that they learn in, various aspects can hinder learning in an 
organisation. The mindsets of managers (dominant general management logic), manageri al 
ignorance and absorptive capacity are three such barriers that may prevent an organisation 
from learning effectively.  
LO 3: Discuss how individuals learn.  
Only individuals can learn knowledge, so organisational learning is ultimately dependent 
on how effectively individuals can learn and adapt.  
LO 4: Explain the transfer of knowledge to others.  
The transfer of knowledge between individuals is the cornerstone of organisational 
learning. However, transferring knowledge is not a simple matter, as the know ledge that 
needs to be transferred can be very complex and hard to share with others.  
251 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
LO 5: Explain how an organisation can become a learning organisation.  
Given that the transfer of knowledge can be very complex, organisations need to think 
about how they can become learning organisations. While some aspects of organisational 
learning can occur spontaneously, there are no guarantees that it will, and in this chapter, 
we highlight seve ral specific actions that can be taken by the management of an 
organisation to encourage and cultivate organisational learning.

Framework  
CHAPTER  
ORIENTATION  Strategy implementation is about ensuring that all the components of 
the organisation (structure, culture and systems) are aligned with the 
chosen strategy (see Chapter 8). In addition to this alignment process, 
there is the question: how do we make strate gy happen ? 
Typically, in strategy implementation, strategies are translated 
into projects that need to be completed as part of the organisation's 
day-to-day operational activities. Projects usually address a task or a 
problem, have outcomes that are clearl y stated, and have well -defined 
boundaries, including a specific start and finish date. In a dynamic and 
complex environment, a new way to translate strategies is needed, 
such as by means of strategic initiatives. Refer to Chapters, Section 8.1, 
where port folios and projects were explained in more detail.  
Resource allocation for strategy implementation is a very 
complex matter, and there is no ‘recipe1 or simple formula that will 
result in successful implementation. So, we can argue that resource 
allocation  is more of an art than a science and that the organisation's 
efforts may be rather messy and based on trial and error, as much as 
on rational decision -making.   
In this chapter, we briefly explore the evolution in management  
perspectives on resource allocation for strategy implementation. We 
look at an effective framework for resource allocation and at various 
practical steps that practitioners can use for resource allocation.  
However, no plans can be implemented without resources such 
as money, skills, and technology; and in this chapter, we focus on the 
deliberate allocation and alignment of resources to implement 
strategies. Figure 10.1 depicts the focus of this chapter in the context of 
strategic management.

Case study  
Poverty alleviation and the National Development Plan1 
Statistics South Africa's, former chief statistician, Pali Lehohla, was a visibly frustrated man at 
the release of the report Poverty Trends in South Africa: An examination of absolute poverty 
between 2006 and 2015.  The report found that poverty in the cou ntry had worsened 
substantially between 2011 and 2015 when 30.4 million (or 55.5 per cent) of citizens were 
classified as poor. Lehohla clearly felt the initiatives to implement the National Development 
Plan (NDF) were not forthcoming.  
256 CHAPTER 10: RESOURCE ALLOCATION FOR STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION  
What I see is things are turning against what the National Development Plan (NDP) 
wants - which is to reduce poverty, increase employment, decrease inequality. On the 
unemployment and poverty front, the country is going in the opposite direction and 
that is a big worry for those who are running the NDP.  
Organisations, like governments, have limited resources to execute their strategic plans, and 
have to allocate their resources to areas where i t is going to have the biggest impact. 
Lehohla said government needed to use statistics (such as those provided by Stats SA) to 
come up with a comprehensive plan to give effect to their strategies, which should respond 
to market needs and provide education  and skills for the poor. There is no short cut to good 
development. It takes time. It takes investment. It takes collective action. Jobs are a problem, 
but when people do not have skills to undertake the job, that's a problem too,' he said. 'In 
the absenc e of planning, this thing is not going to go anywhere ... Here in SA we are 
providing the numbers, but I don't think they are used adequately.'  
LO 1 : Explain  what  resource  allocation  for strategy  implementation  entails.  
10.1  Resource allocation for strategy imp lementation  
The transformation from the industrial to the information age has been accompanied by 
increasingly sophisticated customers, escalating globalisation, more prevalent and subtle 
product differentiation, and an emphasis on intellectual capital and  enhanced employee 
empowerment. In this new world order, management perspectives and practices are 
evolving to meet contemporary needs. Successful strategy implementation has become ever 
more important and new frameworks are being developed to fill the gap  between strategy 
planning and operational activities.  
The business environment today also demands new and integrated management 
approaches for strategy implementation, other than the standard ‘top -down’ and silo - 
treated approaches, such as project management and performance management.  
This is necessary so that someone at the lowest level in any function can answer the 
question: what is the plan for the business over the next few years ? Another question to be 
answered: what am 1 doing to contribute to this plan that will make a difference ? This represents 
a development from ‘making strategy happen’ to embodying strategy, and from traditional 
strategy implementation (the translation of a chosen strategy into organisational action to 
achieve strategic goals and objectives) to resource allocation (a process that aligns - both 
vertically and horizontally - an organisation’s functions and activities with its strategic 
goals and objectives). Resource allocation can therefore be seen to consist of three key 
elements that should be considered as an integrated whole. These elements are first the 
successful implementation of strategic initiatives, second the successful alignment of 
organisational units with the strategic direction of the organisation and third, the successful 
alignment of individual behaviour with strategic direction. This integrated whole is 
depicted in Figure 10.2.

In the following sections, these elements are discussed in more detail, starting with the 
alignment of organisational units with strategic direction.  
10.1.1  Align organisational units with strategic direction.  
Most large organisations will consist of several organisational units, such as strategic 
business units or departments. For successful resource allocation, all three dimensions in 
the hierarchy of strategy, namely, corporate, business and functional, should be aligned and 
should support one another (refer to Chapter 2, Table 2.1 for a clear understandi ng of the 
hierarchical levels). This means that the different business units in an organisation are able 
to draw on the overall corporate strategy. If we take the example of the food retailer, 
Shoprite, the group has a clear focus on reducing their cost an d using a lower cost base to 
provide value for money to their customers. The businesses in the group draws on and is 
aligned to that strategy. Hungry Lion (a fast food business) provides larger portions at 
lower comparative prices to reinforce the strategy  of value for money. It also means that all 
the functional area plans have to align with the concept of value for money. In the example 
below, we compare Woolworths, a high -quality retailer, with Shoprite on some key 
functional areas.

In addition to aligning organisational units with strategic direction, the organisation also 
has to ensure that the behaviour of each individual employee is aligned with strategic 
direction. This is the focus of the next section.  
10.1.2  Align individual behaviour with strategic direction.  
One key element of resource allocation is to ensure that the behaviour and work of every 
employee are aligned with the strategy. In addition to the communication of the strategy, 
there are five tools that organisations can use to achieve this:  
1. The process of alignment starts with the recruitment process. Organisations 
should recruit individuals who support their strategic direction.  
2. Training and development may be required to ensure that the knowledge, skills 
and attitudes of employees match the strategic direction of the organisation.  
3. Policies and procedu res can be used to guide the behaviours of individuals. 
Changes may require old policies and procedures to be reviewed or new policies 
and procedures to be introduced.  
4. The process of cascading objectives can be used as a framework for setting 
objectives lo wer down in the organisation, for example, by using the balanced 
scorecard in conjunction with a performance management system. In using this 
approach, strategic objectives will typically be used to derive annual objectives, 
which will, in turn, be used to  define the actions and required performance levels 
of individual employees (see Figure 10.3).  
259 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
5. Reward systems that are tailored to reward behaviours and achievements that are 
in line with the strategy may encourage individuals to behave and actively 
support the strategic direction (see the practising strategy box below).  
Practising strategy: Adrian Gore on fostering an 
innovative culture at Discovery2 
We're often asked, 'Can you keep innovating?' The truth is, I find that the more you 
innovate, the more you can innovate. Most innovation in companies is event based. A 
competitor comes up with something, and the company responds. We do the opposite. 
Our leaders are always on a treadmill to create and launch new ideas. For example, 
every year we have a rock -star launch where we're presenting something new to 
thousands of our intermediaries who own sales. Our guys know the date is booked. 
The concert's happening. You just better write the m usic. 
We have growth metrics for a lot of what we do. Our earnings per share have 
grown by 25 percent a year, compounded, for the last two decades, with little capital. 
But my personal view is that the rationales behind innovation and earnings targets are 
not really great bedfellows. You have to invest in innovation, even if you don't know 
where it will end up. But with a growth -target mind -set, you're always thinking, ‘Oh, we 
can't do this, because it’s going to undermine our margins' or whatever. You ough t to 
do both well, but it's challenging to balance those two parts of your brain.  
To push ourselves to find the next idea, we have an internal competition every 
year called Inspiring Excellence, where our top one thousand leaders break into teams 
of two to  four people and work on new concepts. Throughout the year, we hold 
contests until we’ve narrowed down to the top five teams, who present at our annual 
management conference. Even ideas that don't win often prove to be winners later on, 
when we roll them o ut. This programme provides us with a strong inventory of 
possibilities, which are continually replenished.  
Twice a year, our remuneration committee looks at each business and gives it 
an innovation score. So the take -home bonus of a thousand people is bas ed on a 
subjective review of the success of their launches. But even beyond that pool, all our 
employees are involved in this time -based cycle, working on projects. Across the 
organisation, there's a natural metronome of our innovation.  
I genuinely believe  that the smartest people work for the organisations they 
believe are doing good. At Discovery, our people have built innovative businesses that 
are good, not only for the company, but also for our customers. I'm dedicated to 
Discovery's work in building S outh Africa and communities around the world. I want 
South Africans to look at Discovery with hope, to feel the future is certain.  
260 CHAPTER 10: RESOURCE ALLOCATION FOR STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION  
Resource allocation can be seen as a continuum with deliberate planning at one end and a 
more open and fluid process approach at the other.3 Prescriptive planning involves moving 
from strategies to actions through the process of setting objectives and performance 
controls, allocating resource s and motivating employees. This approach uses ‘hard’ 
management practices (such as reward systems) and focuses on systems or practices that 
are analytical in nature. In contrast, process approaches emphasise people changing their 
behaviour. These approach es use ‘soft’ management practices which are people -oriented, 
cognitive or behavioural in nature. They focus on changing the assumptions and routines of 
people in the organisation, including those of managers.4 
In the next section, we turn our attention to  the third element of resource allocation 
for strategy implementation, namely, the successful implementation of strategic initiatives.  
10.1.3  Implement strategic initiatives.  
As we pointed out in Chapter 2, strategy is not about business as usual. It is rather ab out 
those chosen courses of action that will lead to positive changes in the performance of the 
organisation. To achieve these changes, the organisation will need to implement strategic 
initiatives successfully. Strategic initiatives refer to those key pro jects or programmes 
(multiple independent projects managed as a single unit) focused on achieving a specific 
objective or improving performance to achieve a performance target. The role of projects in 
resource allocation is discussed in more detail in Sect ion 10.2.  
10.1.4  Implement enablers of resource allocation.  
Resource allocation is a challenging and complex process, and it is underpinned by three 
important enablers, namely, communication of the strategy, the ability of the organisation 
to learn and adapt, and  the allocation of adequate resources.  
Communicate the strategy  
The most obvious way to deploy a strategy is to ensure that everyone in the organisation 
understands the strategy and what it means to him or her individually. This is necessary 
because not ev eryone can be equally involved in making strategic choices, but all 
employees do need to be aware of what the strategy entails and how it affects them. There 
are four main objectives for the communication of strategy:  
1. To ensure that everyone in the organis ation understands what the strategy is and 
how it will affect them  
2. To resolve uncertainty about the strategy (for example, by allowing employees to 
ask questions and to clarify)  
3. To explain the assumptions and judgements that were made during the analysis 
process and to explain the decisions that were made and backup plans  
4. To ensure a common understanding of the strategy and co -ordination across all 
organisational units.   
PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
In most cases, simply enforcing a strategy will elicit resistance to change. For that reason, 
one of the key objectives of the communication process may be to ‘sell’ the strategy to the 
organisation, and to ensure that everyone understands why the decision was made and w hy 
it was the best decision under the circumstances.  
The communication of the strategy may comprise of formal communication 
initiatives, such as presentations by management, ‘roadshows' throughout the organisation 
detailing the strategy, and the use of company newsletters and intranets to provide the 
required information. However, it is also important for managers to ensure that they adopt 
the new strategy in their everyday language and in informal communication with their peers 
and subordinates, and eve n other stakeholders, such as customers.  
Practising strategy: Communicating 
strategic change5 
In a typical strategic change process, there are several ways to communicate the 
strategy to the workforce:  
¦ Face-to-face meetings or 'roadshows' can be used as pl atforms where 
employees can interact with management.  
¦ Documents outlining the strategy can be developed and translated into all 
relevant languages.  
¦ 'Best' or desired practices can be communicated using face -to-face and 
virtual communications.  
¦ Success stories are published and publicly celebrated.  
¦ Strategy principles and values can be distributed to employees on printed 
cards, screens and posters.  
Organisational learning and adaptation  
In the industrial era, the creation and implementation of strategy w as a kind of ‘ready, aim, 
fire’ process. This approach worked reasonably well in a relatively linear, stable and 
predictable environment. But today’s discontinuous environment rather requires a ‘ready, 
fire, steer’ approach. In other words, the organisatio n's strategic direction is developed, 
implemented, and then repeatedly and continuously modified in response to changes in the 
environment and in the organisation’s own realities. Knowing when to change the strategic 
direction is the difference between suc cess and failure. Successful organisations are those 
that have the discipline necessary to change when it is not working; to change the strategy 
without abandoning the whole vision. The changed strategies are deployed by adapting the 
organisation’s existin g strategic initiatives or creating new ones.  
262 CHAPTER 10: RESOURCE ALLOCATION FOR STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION  
Experimentation offers one key to making these adjustments successfully. A readiness to 
experiment, to learn from the results, and to adjust accordingly is a hallmark of adaptive 
organisations (see Chapter 9 for a discussion on organisational learning).  
Although successful organisations are, by definition, organisations that do things 
right, not making mistakes can stifle learning . To learn from experimentation requires a 
mistake -friendly, knowledge -sharing culture and should be part of every resource -
allocation process.  
Allocate adequate resources  
All organisations have limited resources, so it logically follows that resources should be 
allocated first to those projects or activities that contribute most to the strategic success of 
the organisation. In considering requests for funding and in the budgeting process, 
organisations should take the following into account:  
¦ The extent to which the proposal contributes towards the organisation’s mission 
and long -term objectives.  
¦ The extent to which the proposal supports the strategic direction and key 
strategic initiatives.  
¦ The level of risk associated with the proposal and the extent to  which it fits the 
organisation’s risk profile.  
The proposals that most contribute towards the strategic success of the organisation and 
best fits its risk profile should enjoy preference.  
In the next section, we summarise the resource allocation process.  
10.1.5  Align strategy with the internal environment.  
In summaiy, we can regard resource allocation as a process for aligning all organisational 
units and employees with the formulated strategies. This alignment is depicted in Figure 
10.3.  
However, we should remem ber that it is not simply a matter of cascading objectives, 
metrics and strategies. The process is much more complex than that, and communication, 
resource allocation, managing strategic initiatives and change are all part of it. However, at 
the most basic  level, resource allocation is about ensuring that all of the business unit 
goals, metrics and strategies are aligned with the corporate goals, metrics and strategies; 
that functional goals, metrics and plans support the business units, and that the functi onal 
level plans and tactics translate into individual measurements and tasks. The balanced 
scorecard is an example of a tool that can be used to align goals and metrics across the 
whole organisation.

Practising strategy: Resource allocation in a 
retailer  
In this example, we try to illustrate how the  cascading and alignment process may 
work in a retailing group focused on providing high -quality goods (think of a retailer 
like Woolworths). For such a retailer, the ability to buy and sell excellent quality 
products is a key element of their success.  
At the same time, they may be looking to expand into new areas and shopping 
format. For instance, Woolworths have outlets in certain Engen forecourts. At the 
corporate level, the focus may be to grow by increasing revenue. The return on 
shareholders' equity m ay be an example of a metric related to this goal. As a strategy, 
the group may be looking to expand their investment into new shopping formats and 
geographical areas (for example, moving into more countries in Africa).  
At the business level, the focus may  be on differentiation - providing high 
quality at a relatively high price. The objective may, therefore, be to increase 
profitability. An example of a metric may be the gross profit margin (the difference 
between sales revenue and the cost of sales divide d by sales).  
264 CHAPTER 10: RESOURCE ALLOCATION FOR STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION  
The strategy for achieving this may be through innovation and quality management to 
provide higher quality products that contribute to environmental sustaina bility.  
At the functional level, one area of focus may be to increase the percentage of 
products with environmentally friendly packaging. The strategy may be to work with 
and incentivise producers (suppliers) for 'greening' their packaging.  
At the individual level, buyers may be required to actively source new 
environmentally friendly forms of packaging to use. There may be certain standards 
or policies, for example, that certain types of packaging may not be used. They may 
be measured, for instance , on the number of new innovations they introduce in this 
regard.  
In the next section, we explore a project -based framework for resource allocation.  
LO 2:  Explain  what  the Strategy  Execution  Framework  entails.  
10.2  A strategic execution framework  
Much of the fo cus in traditional strategy literature has been on strategy formulation, while 
relatively few models widely accepted by practitioners have been developed for strategy 
implementation or deployment. Early frameworks of strategy implementation typically 
simpl y listed and described implementation factors. However, strategy implementation and 
deployment is the area where a strategy is most likely to fail, so a more coherent 
framework for resource allocation should be of considerable value.  
The Strategic Execution Framework® (SEF)6 is a resource allocation framework that 
helps to align an organisation’s projects and programmes with its strategies. As we have 
argued already, strategy is about change, and for that reason, resource allocation is in 
essence pr oject -based work (rather than merely aligning the day -to-day operations) which 
requires the selection of and investment in specific engagements, portfolios, programmes 
and projects, which we refer to as strategic initiatives. (Refer to Chapter 8, Section 8 .1, 
where these concepts were explained.)  
The purpose of the SEF is to help organisations to align activities and strategic 
direction better. According to this framework, there are six key aspects or domains of an 
organisation that must harmonise in respec t of resource allocation. These are described in 
Table 10.1.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Table 10.1 The six domains of the Strategic Execution Framework  
Ideation  An organisation's identity, how it  sees itself and how i t wants to appear to the 
world.  This is expressed through statements of its purpose, identity and 
long -range intention. Companies with weak ideation will typically be 
reactive and focused on the short term. The basic elements of ideation 
were discussed in Chapter 3, Section 3.4.1, as 'strategic direction!  
Nature  The physical and psychological manifestation of the organisation in the form 
of its culture (also  see Chapter 11), its structure (also see Chapter 13) and its 
strategy (also see Chapter 7).  Together these elements create the internal 
context of the organisation. It is important that there is a good fit 
between these three elements. For example, if an organisation is 
dependent on innovation and quick response times, having a very 
hierarchical  structure with rigid functional silos will not support its 
strategy.  
Vision  Where the organisation wants to be in the future.  In this case, 'vision' refers 
to more than just a vision statement (which is an expression of ideation), 
it refers to the organisation's key goals, strategies and measures 
(metrics) that drive its strategy. Again it is important to ensure that there 
is a good fit between the goals the organisation wants to achieve, its 
strategies and the key metrics it will need to measure progress. These 
aspects were also addressed in Chapter 3.  
Engagement  The engagement domain is central to strategic execution. During engagement, 
the strategy is actioned by selecting a portfolio of strategic initiatives that will 
move the organisation towards its strategic goals.  Therefore, the engagement 
domain is expressed through statements of strategy and portfolio. The 
ability to c hoose and fund the right projects and programmes is based on 
clarity in terms of goals, metrics and strategy (see Figure 10.4).  
Synthesis  Synthesis is when the portfolio culminates in specific strategic initiatives in 
the form of programmes or projects.  Our view of programme and project 
management, in this instance, refers to the strategic role of projects, 
rather than to the tactical role normally assigned to it.  
Transition  Transition is when the programmes and projects result in outcomes that then 
become part of the operations, ie the day -to-day activities of the organisation.  
For example, a project may result in the development of a new product 
range, which is then absorbed into the organisation's value chain of 
production, sales and after -sales su pport.  
All six of the domains outlined above are critical to the deployment process. Quite 
appropriately the six essential domains - ideation, nature, vision, engagement, synthesis 
and transition - combine to form the acronym INVEST. However, since the  
266 CHAPTER 10: RESOURCE ALLOCATION FOR STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION  
aspects of ideation, nature and vision were discussed in other chapters in this book (see 
Table 10.1), in this section, we will focus on the aspects most closely related to 
deployment, namely, engagement, synthesis and transition.  
Figure 10.4 depicts the Strategy Execution Framework®, incorporating the six 
domains, ideation, nature, vision, engagement, synthesis, and transition and the 
components of each of the six domains.  
 
10.2.1  Engagement  
The engagement phase is where the organisation decides how it is going to spend its money 
to its strategy and to attain it s vision. This process requires a lot of discipline, as there are 
generally always too many projects and too few resources. The allocation of resources is 
always in danger of being 'hijacked' by powerful executives or board members with pet 
projects, and t o prevent this, vigorous debate and clear decision criteria are required.  
267 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
In the first instance, the organisation must understand what needs to be done as part of the 
roll-out of the strategy. In the engagement domain, strategy consists of understanding 
where we are (R), where we want to be (2B) and the path we need to follow to get to where 
we want to be (PATH). This can be expressed as R + 2B + PATH. ‘Knowing where we are’ 
requires t he organisation to understand its current ideation, current nature and current 
progress towards vision (for example, understanding progress towards key metrics). On the 
‘2B’ side, the organisation needs to understand what structural changes should be made,  
what change is required to align culture and what gaps exist between current and desired 
performance. The PATH is expressed through the specific initiatives that the organisation 
needs to implement to ensure alignment of strategy with nature and performan ce. 
At this point, organisations may well have an entire potential portfolio of investments, 
but due to limited resources, it will not be able to invest in all of them, and will have to 
make tough choices. One element that may help to make this process mor e rigorous (rather 
than just guesswork) is for the organisation to have clear criteria for selecting initiatives. 
Some of the following elements may be useful as decision criteria (there may, of course, be 
many more, depending on the organisation):  
¦ Alignin g strategy and strategic capabilities  
¦ Implementing financial measures (such as payback periods or return on 
investment)  
¦ Contributing towards achievement of long -term objectives  
¦ Determinig the level of risk the organisation is prepared  to accept (also  
known  as risk appetite).  
The purpose of the engagement process is to translate strategy into action, and to prioritise 
actions in a way that eliminates guesswork and power play in the allocation of resources. 
The clearer the link between the funding decision an d the strategy, the better the level of 
alignment between strategy and deployment.  
10.2.2  Synthesis  
The investment portfolio of the organisation funds those activities that are strategic 
initiatives and not part of the normal day -to-day operations of the organisation. For that 
reason, it is managed by means of programme and project management, with a view to 
ultimately absorbing it into the operations of the organisation. The synthesis domain (see 
Figure 10.4) has three key performance areas:  
1. The organisat ion must have a process methodology and  structure  for 
managing project -based work on a strategic level.  
2. The organisation must have process maturity for these process methodologies - in 
other words, it must have the capability to manage the process.  
3. Executive sponsorship of project -based work, to the extent that every project 
should have an executive sponsor.  
These elements are discussed in more detail below.  
268 CHAPTER 10: RESOURCE ALLOCATION FOR STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION  
Process met hodology  
In the process methodology for programme and project management, there are two key 
concepts:  
1. Programme management is the process of managing multiple, but interrelated 
projects. For example, in a large merger, there may be many different projects - 
some to integrate information technology (IT) systems, others to harmonise the 
human resource processes and still others to identify opportunities for cost 
reduction. The role of programme management will be to oversee all of the 
different projects, to t rack progress and to identify potential barriers to 
successful completion.  
2. Project management requires a project team to set the scope of a project, to 
develop a project schedule, to obtain project resources, to implement the project 
phases and to track pr ogress.  
Project and portfolio management are almost universally regarded as core skills in today’s 
organisations, and strategy implementation is no exception.  
Process maturity  
Many organisations do programme or project management on a tactical level. For e xample, 
it is a common approach to the development and implementation of IT systems. However, 
not many organisations do it successfully at the level of strategy implementation. Maturity 
is best viewed on a scale where ‘no formal approach’ is the bottom of the scale and ‘best -
in-class performance’ is at the top. The lower the level of maturity, the less the chance of 
successfully using programme and project management in strategy implementation, and the 
more work the organisation needs to do to develop matur ity in these critical skills.  
Executive sponsorship  
Without an executive sponsor to champion a project, it has little chance of succeeding. The 
role of the executive sponsor is to help overcome obstacles, to maintain visibility for the 
project and to help with investing in opportunities.  
10.2.3  Transition  
The outcomes of programme and project management will ultimately become part of the 
day-to-day activities (operations) of the organisation. The transition domain is where the 
organisation’s strategic efforts succeed or fail and result in achievement of metrics or not.  
There are two types of transitional arrangements that have to be balanced by the 
organisation. First, existing systems and processes have to be maintained and continuously 
improved upon in order to reap the benefits from them. At the same time, the resource 
allocation process is about finding those breakthrough changes that will really alter the 
game and ensure a step -up in performance. For example,  
269 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
when South African Breweries (SAB) acquired Miller Breweries in the US, it was important 
for SAB to maintain and improve their existing business while integrating Miller into the 
SAB fold. When the new organisation (SABMiller) emer ged, it was a breakthrough change 
- SABMiller was now a global instead of just a regional player in the beer industry.  
Second, during the transition process, it is vital that strategic control (see Chapter 
14) ensure that the strategic metrics of the organ isation are achieved. Metrics throughout 
the organisation must be aligned and work towards the same ultimate goal.  
The complexity' of the strategy implementation process means that managers are 
simply unable to have a view of all strategic aspects continua lly and at the same time. For 
this reason, this framework provides a means of directing the attention of managers to key 
focus areas of strategy implementation to be addressed and managed.  
In the next section, we will focus on management practices and tool s in resource 
allocation, specifically in respect of managing strategic initiatives.  
LO 3:  Explain  the management  of strategic  initiatives.  
10.3  Managing strategic initiatives  
Determining the strategic direction for the organisation is the strategic leadership action 
that is perceived to play one of the most important roles in effective resource allocation. 
Strategic leadership is multi -functional, involves managing through others, and helps 
organisations to cope with change that seems to be increasing exponenti ally in today’s 
globalised business environment.  
Strategic leadership requires the ability to accommodate and integrate both the 
internal and external business environments of the organisation, and to manage and engage 
in complex information processing. Le adership practices (see Chapter 12 for a discussion 
on strategic leadership) for boards of directors in resource allocation include the 
following:7 
¦ Ensuring a steady flow of strategic initiatives and projects to achieve the 
strategic objectives  
¦ Developing decision frameworks for selecting strategic portfolio investments and 
for terminating unsuccessful initiatives  
¦ Regularly evaluating the progress of strategic initiatives and strategy 
implementation.  
The role of management is required in the resource -alloca tion process for planning and 
directing activities, and monitoring and taking corrective action where necessary.  
Leadership and management are therefore emphasised differently in resource 
allocation (see Figure 10.5). The Strategic Execution Framework can be used to make the 
distinction between the role of leaders and managers in resource allocation.  
270 CHAPTER 10: RESOURCE ALLOCATION FOR STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION  
Leaders, on the one hand, will have a strategic view and focus on the first three domains of 
the SEF in terms of resource allocation, namely, the nature, vision and engagement of the 
organisation. Managers, on the other hand, will have a more operational view and focus on 
the engagement, synthesis, and transition domains of the SE F. The focus in this section is 
on operational management, specifically the management of strategic initiatives and the 
process of making strategy part of everyone’s job.  
Leadership  
 
Figure 10.5 Leading and managing for resource allocation  
The process of managing strategic initiatives consists of the following (see Figure 10.6):  
¦ Developing strategic initiatives by translating strategic goals into strategic 
initiatives  
¦ Prioritising strategic initiatives  
¦ Defining and approving strategic initiatives  
¦ Aligning individual behaviour  
¦ Reporting on strategic initiatives and taking corrective action where required.  
This process is discussed next.

10.3.1  Translate goals into potential strategic initiatives  
In transitioning from strategic decisions to resource allocation, the first task is to translate 
strategic goals into specific initiat ives that the organisation will undertake in the near 
future. The purpose is to create a detailed roadmap that aligns the day -to-day activities of 
the organisation with the strategic direction (see Figure 10.7 for an example).

be met to achieve our 
strategy?

Figure 10.7 An example of resource allocation from strategic objectives  
From Figure 10.2, we can see that the process of resource allocation starts with the 
identification of strategic objectives, the few key things that the organisation wants to 
achieve. If we use the example of a supermarket in a small rural town, the owner  CHAPTER 10: RESOURCE ALLOCATION FOR STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION  
of the supermarket may want to achieve ‘sustainable profitability’ as a key goal to ensure 
the survival of his business in the future. The next step is to identify how he is going to 
measure his success (or failure) in this regard, and the answer is relatively simple - the net 
profit of his supermarket is the most important measure. Next, he will set himself a 
performance improvement target. He is struggling at the moment and making a loss of 
R500,000 for the year (which prompted him to start thinking strategically!). He would like 
to be in a position in which he makes a net profit of R1 million per year three years from 
now. To achieve that, he will need to identify some strat egic initiatives that are ‘new’ to 
his business. One example may be to develop a loyalty programme for his customers, 
which would encourage them to buy only from his supermarket in turn for some rewards. 
This will now be a project that he must manage, and will require him to, for example, do 
some research about loyalty programmes and what his customers want as a first step.  
Successful strategy execution or deployment is achieved when the strategic 
initiatives realise the set improvement targets, the set imp rovement targets meet the set 
measures, and the set measures result in the attainment of the set objectives to achieve the 
strategy (Figure 10.7). Refer to our discussion of the top -down and bottom -up aspects of 
strategy formation and implementation in Cha pter 8, Section 8.2. Misalignment between 
strategic initiatives and measures may result in wasted resource with no clear improvement 
in performance.  
Initiatives are the major efforts required to make progress toward strategic goals, 
and they must be clearl y described during the implementation process in order to facilitate 
the selection of the most viable initiatives. Defining the elements outlined in Table 10.2 
for each initiative will enable decision -makers to compare and evaluate initiatives.  
Table 10.2 Defining initiatives  
• Deliverables: What will be the results of the initiative? How will 'success' be 
measured?  
• Initiative leader and team: Who is responsible and involved in the work?  
• Key activities: What action steps need to be undertaken to achieve the d eliverable?  
• Resource requirements: What investments (people, equipment, time, and finances) 
will be needed to carry out the initiative?  
• Interdependencies: How will the initiative impact on other functions or areas of the 
organisation? How will it affect other initiatives?  
• Milestones: What are the major events, accomplishments, or key decision points that 
are anticipated? How will you know when and if your initiative is on or off track?  
• Performance metrics: What will you measure to gauge progress on your i nitiative?  
How will you utilise these performance metrics to tell if your initiative is on or  
off track?  
• Timeline: When will the initiative begin and end? At what milestone will you judge

10.3.2  Prioritising strategic initiatives  
In the context of the planning process, organisations must identify strategic initiatives and 
prioritise them based on strategic impact. There will most likely be numerous i nitiatives 
competing for resource allocation. Rather than depending on individuals or a small group 
of individuals to make the decision, it is better to put together a multidisciplinary workshop 
or panel using clear selection criteria. Qualitative and quan titative information on each 
potential initiative should be distributed to panel members to enable productive discussions 
and decision -making. Good descriptions of the potential impacts of the initiatives will 
assist in understanding the trade -offs in the prioritisation process.  
To ensure that eveiyone has an understanding of each of the initiatives, strategic 
initiative leaders should provide an overview of their proposed initiative. The briefing 
should include the following information:  
¦ A description of the initiative  
¦ How it supports the strategic agenda  
¦ The expected impact or outcome (if possible, this should be linked to strategic 
goals and metrics)  
¦ The capital and resource requirements  
¦ Human resource requirements - people and skills  
¦ Revenues and expens es. 
Based on the briefings and documentation provided, projects can be prioritised. For 
example, a simple process for rating initiatives can be as follows:  
Category A initiatives = committed (the organisation will allocate resources) 
Category B initiatives  = high strategic impact Category C initiatives = medium 
strategic impact Category D initiatives = low strategic impact.  
10.3.3  Define and approve strategic initiatives.  
Ultimately only a few important projects should be selected, most likely only from 
categories  A and B. The selected strategic initiatives should be considered holistieally to 
ensure that they address the vision of the organisation and to give different executives an 
outline of how their work connects to the work of others in the organisation. The purpose 
of this step is to get a bird’s eye view of the selected initiatives to get a sense of how they 
interconnect and how to integrate them into a strategic programme and project management 
framework.  CHAPTER 10: RESOURCE ALLOCATION FO R STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION  
10.3.4  Communicate strategic initiatives.  
The purpose of this phase is to ensure that all employees are aware of the strategy and 
strategic initiatives that will be funded. Resource allocation may require that employees do 
things differently, and to get them on board, they will need to understand why the change 
is required and what they must do differently.  
It is also important to link strategic initiatives with individual performance 
agreements, so that there is an explicit relati on between individual behaviour and strategic 
initiatives. This process is usually part of the performance management system.  
10.3.5  Strategic initiative reporting and management.  
Organisations that are effective at resource allocation have effective processes in  place for 
systematically measuring and evaluating progress towards their strategic goals. These 
processes help them to remain focused as they execute their strategies, all the time learning 
and adjusting as they go. As we have argued in the previous secti on, programme and 
project management processes are important tools for achieving this outcome.  
There may also be a need to report to the board and senior management specifically 
on progress, and, in this regard, executive dashboards that provide a quick su mmary of 
progress will be most useful. Dashboards can take a variety of formats, but the format is 
less important than the content. Ultimately, when it comes to executive level reporting, 
fewer measures are better.  
As we have seen in the preceding discussions, resource allocation is a complex 
process, and there are many potential barriers that may impede deployment. We discuss 
these barriers in the next section.  
LO 4:  Explain  the creation  of an environment  for effective  resource  allocation.  
10.4  Creating  an environment for effective resource 
allocation  
While strategy implementation will always be a complex process fraught with difficulties, 
there are some steps that an organisation can take to improve strategy implementation. We 
discuss three of these ste ps below.  
1. Management development. Most managers will spend a great deal more time on the 
implementation and deployment of strategy than they do on planning. Yet, this is the 
area in which they most often lack skills. Managers need to learn the skills of strategy 
implementation (such as project management and performance management), 
managing change and communication.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
2. A participative process for strategy development. Rather than being seen a s the 
domain of a few top managers developing a strategy in their ivory towers, strategy 
should be an organisation -wide discussion to ensure that those who are involved in the 
implementation and deployment participate in the development of strategies. The 
value is that any potential implementation problems will be identified early on in the 
process, and the greater the participation, the less the resistance to change.  
3. Developing a clear process for resource allocation. While the process for resource 
allocat ion is not the same for every organisation, it is important that the organisation 
spend some time thinking about how it will manage the implementation process. 
Questions that will need to be answered and addressed by the process include (but are 
not limite d to) the following:  
? How  do we identify strategic initiatives from a formulated strategy?  
? How  do we evaluate competing initiatives to decide which initiatives  
are worth investing in?  
? How  do we manage the selected strategic initiatives?  
? How  do we make strategic initiatives part of our day -to-day activities  
once they have been implemented?  
The big picture  
Strategy implementation and the alignment of organisational resources with strategy is a 
complex and unpredictable process that occurs in a complex and  dynamic environment. 
These realities demand the evolution of management perspectives and new complementary 
management approaches.  
In this chapter, we considered the requirements for successful resource allocation. We 
examined the interaction of strategy a nd resource allocation using the Strategic Execution 
Framework®, through which the complexities of the current business environment and the 
importance of programme and project management in resource allocation may be better 
understood. Leading practices fo r managing strategic initiatives for effective resource 
allocation were identified. We also focused on the potential barriers to resource allocation.  
To come full circle, resource allocation must be supplemented and supported by 
strategy control activities  - which will be addressed in Chapter 14. In the next chapter, we 
will look at organisational culture and strategy.  
276 CHAPTER 10: RESOURCE ALLOCATION FOR STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION  
Summary or learning outcomes  
LO 1: Explain what resource allocation for strategy implementation entails and 
give appropriate examples of resource allocation in organisations.  
Successful resource allocation rests on three pillars, namely, the alignment of different 
organisations units to ensure that they are all working towards the same goals, the 
alignment of the behaviour of all employees in the organisation with strategic direction, 
and the selection and implementation of strategic initiatives that will have the biggest 
impact in achieving strategic objectives.  
LO 2: Explain what the resource allocation process using the Strategic Execution 
Framework (SEF) entails.  
The Strategic Execution Framework (SEF) is a specific framework that facilitates the 
selection and implementation of strategic initiatives (through p rogramme and project 
management) to ensure the achievement of strategic objective.  
LO 3: Explain the management of strategic initiatives.  
The implementation of strategic initiative requireas the organisation to translate its goals 
into strategic initiatives; to prioritise strategic initiatives and select those with the highest 
impact; to communicate strategic initiatives and to link them with individuals’ jobs where 
applicable, and to report on progress with regard to the implementation of strateg ic 
initiatives.  
Discussion questions  
1. Differentiate between ‘strategy implementation projects’ and ‘strategic initiatives’.  
2. Differentiate between ‘strategic implementation’ and resource allocation’.  
3.  Explain the enablers of effective resource allocation wit h the help of examples.  
4.  Explain the Strategic Execution Framework® (SEF) with the help of the six INVEST 
domains.  
6. Explain the role of programme and project management in strategy implementation.  
7. List and briefly discuss the steps in the strategic initiative management process.  
Learning activities  
1. Watch the video on the balanced scorecard (BSC) at http://www.youtube.com/  
watch?v=AdXt8BfiGJg and see if you can explain how the BSC fits into the resource -
allocation process.

LEARNING  
OUTCOMES  After reading this chapter, you should be able to do the following:  
LO 1: Describe what organisational culture encompasses.  
LO 2: Explain the various layers of organisational culture.  
LO 3: Explain the use of the cultural web as an approach to assess an 
organisation's culture.  
LO 4: Explain how an organisation can instil an organisational culture 
that supports good strategy implementation.  
LO 5: Explain the various culture indicators that can be used to 
gauge the health of an organisation's culture.  
LO 6: Discuss the key considerations in organisational culture and 
strategy.  
KEY WORDS  Cultural web  Organisational culture  
Can you recall a situation in which you got into an argument with 
someone and upon reflecting on the somewhat heated discussion, you 
still find it hard to understand how your opponent could take such an 
unreasonable position? In the role of student, researcher or employee, 
you may find it even more difficult to comprehend how a person in a 
position of authority, especially your immediate line managers or those 
we consider our leaders, can be so set in their ways. These different 
opini ons, or ways of doing things, are often explained through 
different cultural backgrounds.1 
Extending the concept of culture beyond differences found on 
a national or ethnical level, this chapter will argue that every 
organisation also has its own unique cu lture. We will furthermore 
propose that the essence of an organisation's work climate is a product 
of the core values and business principles that executives espouse, the 
standards of what is ethically acceptable, the work practices and norms 
of behaviour that define ‘how we do things around here', and the 
approach to people management. These values and standards are 
expressed in the style of operating, the 'chemistry'   
and the 'personality' that permeates the work environmen t and the 
stories that get told over and over to illustrate and reinforce the 
organisation's values, business practices and traditions, similar to what 
we see in the opening case study regarding Investec’s senior 
management's statements. It is important to  understand and assess 
organisational culture as it influences the organisation's actions and 
approaches to conducting business and the way in which strategy is 
implemented. In a very real sense, organisational culture is the 
organisation's automatic, self -replicating ‘operating system' and can be 
thought of as organisational DIMA.2 
In this chapter, we will demystify organisational culture and 
argue that the power of culture lies in the ability to bring employees 
together to work collectively towards achiev ing the same goal. 
According to a national survey conducted by Universum, Investec is 
rated by business and commerce professionals as on one of South 
Africa's most attractive employers.3 As we see in the case study, 
Investec aligns its strategy and corpora te culture successfully to obtain 
positive business outcomes. Investec is known for its strong 
entrepreneurial spirit. The company fosters an open, competitive 
environment in which employees feel empowered, meritocracy is 
encouraged and the status quo ques tioned. Employees are 
discouraged from depending on leaders and encouraged to take 
ownership and find innovative solutions to business challenges. The 
company attracts driven individuals to provide superior service to 
clients4 - a remarkable achievement in  a very competitive industry.

280 CHAPTER 11: ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE AND STRATEGY  
Case study  
Investec - Not a traditional bank  
Investec is an international specialist banking and asset management group, providing a 
diverse range of financial products and services. The company was established in 1974, as a 
small finance company in Johannesburg, South Africa. Today, it is an international business 
managing approximately $124 billion for cl ients all over the world.5 The company's 
philosophy centres on client centricity and they maintain that if you look after your clients, 
your bottom line should look after itself. The company publicly states that there is no magic 
formula to explain their s uccess. However, they consider contributing factors to success as 
the stability of their team, their enduring culture and their unwavering commitment to their 
clients.6 
It's all about the interest of our clients and achieving the investment returns they 
require.  - Hendrik  du Toit, CEO  
Banking is about trust. Ownership and partnership are evident in our client 
interactions.  - Fani Titi, Group  Co-CEO 
If you're not innovating, by definition, you can't give clients good results.  
Kim McFarland - Chief Operating Officer  
A key part of our investment approach is respecting the freedom to create  
John McNab  - Co-chief Investment Officer  
It takes 25 years to create a lasting investment capability. So we build organically.
 Domenico Ferrini - Co-chief Investmen t Officer  
Fundamentally it's about clients trusting us with their money.  
John Green - Global Head of Client Group  
Although the company acknowledges that culture manifests through values and principles 
that guide daily behaviours, attitudes and business practices, they consider values to only 
be the tip of an iceberg. Indeed, according to Marc Kahn, Investec Global Head of Human 
Resources, most of what makes a culture is below the surface. 'Whereas with your values, 
you can physically write them down and they can be copied, shared and learnt, culture itself 
is something you feel, something experiential. It is lived by employees. It is not something 
that is picked up immediately. To understand the culture of an organisation you need to be 
inculcated over ti me and immerse yourself in it.'7 
Kahn maintains that 'culture is something a company is, rather than something a 
company has'. He is further of the opinion that culture cannot, and should not, be 
separated from strategy. Instead, culture should be regarded  as the combination of the 
company's strategy, operating model and business activity. At Investec, behaviour is guided 
by four drivers which combine the company's mission, value and philosophy:8

Investec's culture is created around 'the freedom to create'. They believe that 'people work 
best when they're free to pursue and express their conviction.' They recruit dynamic 
individuals with original spirits who want to pursue their passions and interests.9 In 
recruitment, the foll owing characteristics are considered:10 
¦ An entrepreneurial mindset  
¦ A can -do style  
¦ An innovative spirit  
¦ The highest delivery and extraordinary standards  
¦ Unconventional thinking  
¦ Goal -driven  
¦ A willingness to go the extra mile  
¦ Natural confidence  
¦ A strict moral  code.  
At Investec, strategy is aligned with culture. Investec offers a non -hierarchical workplace 
and encourages honesty and discussion. This company inspires diversity of perspective and 
empowers teams.1' Employees are not scared of authority, happy with  ambiguity and 
challening the status quo, and they don't shy away from conflict. This supports the business 
model which is grounded in an entrepreneurial culture, balanced by a strong risk 
management discipline, client -centric approach and the ability to b e nimble, flexible and 
innovative.12'13 At Investec, success is not achieved by individuals. The organisation is driven 
by individuals who collaborate within and across business units.14 
282 CHAPTER 11: ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE AND STRATEGY  
LO 1:  Describe  what  organisational  culture  encompasses.  
11.1  Organisational culture  
There are many definitions of organisational culture. Most definitions refer to the taken - 
for-granted assumptions and beliefs that are shared by members of an organisation, often 
expressed as the way we do things around here . It is these assumptions that determine how 
groups of people respond and behave in relation to issues that they face.15 More formally, 
organisational culture is defined as ‘the accumulated shared learning of that group as it 
solves its problems of external adaption and internal integra tion; which has worked well 
enough to be considered valid and, therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct 
way to perceive, think, feel, and behave in relation to those problems’.16 
From the above definition, it becomes clear that culture evolves  over time and is the 
result of accumulated and shared learning. With time, learning gets incorporated in what a 
group believes, its values and behaviour and simply become part of everyday thinking and 
doing. When learning becomes part of being and doing, it is taken for granted and 
subsequently drops out of awareness. However, although it drops out of awareness, it 
becomes part of the identity of an organisation. It will be taught to newcomers as ‘this is 
who we are, this is what we do, and these are our b eliefs.’17 
LO 2:  Explain  the various  layers  of organisational  culture.  
11.2  The layers of organisational culture  
Edward Hall (an American anthropologist) developed the iceberg analogy of organisational 
culture in 1976. He reasoned that if culture is an iceberg,  there are some aspects which are 
visible and can be seen (above the water), and a larger aspect which is hidden beneath the 
surface (below the water).18 The tip of the iceberg typically consists of tangible 
manifestations that you can see and feel. The la yers below the water, however, become 
more intangible and less visible. These aspects include espoused values and norms and 
taken -for-granted assumptions as illustrated in Figure 11.2.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
 
Figure 11.2:  Organisational  culture as an iceberg19 
11.2.1  Visible artefacts  
The English Oxford Living Dictionary defines an artefact as ‘an object made by a human 
being, typically one of cultural or historical interest’.20 In organisations, artefacts prevail 
in how offices are decorated, the language used, and branding elements ranging from logos 
to stationery, how employees dress. Artefacts a re everywhere and are visible throughout 
the organisation. Artefacts can be seen in the name of an organisation, its employees, its 
products, its buildings, its processes, as well as in its contracts.21 
Artefacts have three important dimensions which we need to consider: 
instrumentality, aesthetics and symbolism.22 The instrumentality of an artefact refers to the 
extent to which an artefact can help or hinder organisational performance. In other words, 
it considers the efficiency and effectiveness of stru ctures, processes, procedures and 
infrastructure within organisations. Aesthetics focus on the look and CHAPTER 11: ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE AND STRATEGY  
feel of the artefact and on the sensory experience it elicits. Symbolism considers the  
associations or meaning of an artefact. To put this in practice, we will consider how 
Standard Bank incorporated artefacts in designing their retail branches.23 
When Standard Bank realised that digital technology has revolutionised the way 
consumers condu ct their financial affairs, specifically banking, they had to rethink the role 
of a traditional bank with walk -in branches. As a result, this bank introduced a new store 
design in 2015 intended to help move the bank’s refreshed customer experience forward 
and reflect its commitment to innovation. The bank appointed a specialist retail design 
agency, Design Partnership, to assist in this process. To inform its design, the agency 
gained an understanding of the needs of Standard Bank’s clients when they visit a bank. 
First, they realised that the branches comprised a series of spaces that needed to be easily 
identified by customers so that they know where to go. Second, they realised that they 
needed spaces that facilitated a handful of basic activities - mostl y people having, or 
waiting to have, conversations. These insights informed the layout of the branch.  
For most clients, the first conversation they have in a branch is with the help desk. 
In the new design, the help desk was renamed as the ‘Hello Desk’. Th is desk was well 
signposted and located in front of the branch so that it is the first place a client encounters. 
Unlike other help desks that face outwards, the desk was turned 90 degrees to prevent a 
possible service breakdown and to ensure that someone was watching the clients. Following 
international design trends, a Service Bar was introduced to consolidate all queries and 
enquires at one counter. Studies have found that a single queue was more effective in 
eliminating the possibility of queuing in the  wrong place and dramatically reducing the 
time to service. In order to maximise space and atmosphere, a Self -Service Lounge 
combined waiting with the option to ‘help yourself. In this area, clients are helped by a 
staff member to get to grips with the new  self-service tools.  
In terms of aesthetics, the bank followed applied experiences from hospitality and 
retail sectors which show that comfy booths are the most popular seats in any South 
African restaurant. As such, these seating arrangements were introdu ced in all the sit -down 
chat spaces. Traditional queues requiring clients to stand while waiting were replaced with 
long benches and stools at standing counters to enable clients to be seated while waiting.  
According to Callie van der Merwe, Design Partner ship CEO, a core part of the 
design brief was the visual language of the makeover.  
One of the key requirements was to create 'conversation capital'; a visual reference 
that would do the one thing that banks traditionally have never done, which is appeal 
to all ages, profiles and personalities. So in other words, create a visual bank 
representation that would be extremely strong in breaking perceptions of what a bank 
conventionally looked like (or perhaps even, should look like) but without polarising 
opinio ns. 
285 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Branding thus became a key consideration and while Standard Bank has always been the 
blue bank, it was decided that the trading colour would be used sparing in the branches.  
I/Ve wanted customers to recognise the brand, but  we also wanted them to stop and 
look twice; interrupt their normal pattern. Too much blue and the shift that we needed 
would not be evident. Too little blue, and people might miss it. Blue has been used as 
the call -out on the signage, the shop front and the blue wall of the ATMs. This is how 
you recognise the bank. But once inside, customers don't need to be reminded that 
they were in Standard Bank. Here we wanted to show them something different. We 
chose clues and  archetypes, colours and finishing palettes that were tranquil, calm 
and considered - all the things that a good conversation about your finances should 
be... not just blue!.  
Although the branch design considered the instrumentality, aesthetics and symbolism of 
artefacts, the bank acknowledged that each space had to accommodate the human factor. 
Clients come to banks to interact with people, not with screens. Artefacts in Standard Bank 
branches provide visual anchors to support the bank’s overall pos ition as a bank that is 
innovative, forward -thinking and has an interest in the well -being of their clients.  
11.2.2  Espoused values and norms  
The second layer of organisational culture refers to a collection of values and norms shared 
by people and groups who wor k together. These values and norms are often contained in 
value statements which outline the organisational values (beliefs and ideas about what 
kinds of goals the members of an organisation should pursue) and the appropriate kinds or 
standards of behaviou r organisational members should use to achieve these goals.24 Such 
values and behaviour have an important influence on strategy formulation and 
implementation as they govern how groups of people will respond to envisaged changes. To 
fully understand organi sational culture, we thus need to be familiar with agreed values, 
beliefs and behaviours.  
¦ Values. The values of an organisation are the beliefs, traits and behavioural norms 
that management has determined should guide the pursuit of its vision and mission.25 
In many organisations, these values are explicit and written down in value statements. 
In Chapter 12 (Responsible strategic leadership), values will be discussed in more 
detail.  
¦ Beliefs. Beliefs reflect someone’s sense of what ought to be and can typica lly be 
discerned in how people talk about issues the organisation faces,26 that is, a belief not 
to trade with certain countries who are known to demand bribes in exchange for local 
contracts.  
¦ Behaviours. Behaviours are the day -to-day ways in which an organisation operates, 
including work routines, and how the organisation is structured and controlled. These 
behaviours may become taken -for-granted ‘ways we do things  
286  
CHAPTER 11: ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE AND STRATEGY  
around here’  that are potentially the basis for inimitable strategic capabilities. 
However, such behaviours also have the potential to create significant barriers to 
achieving strategic change.27 
We acknowledge that individual employees are guided by their own meaning  systems, but 
in an organisational context, we are interested in the collective, rather than individual 
reactions. Consider, for example how Vodacom Lesotho expresses their values and norms 
in a statement, entitled the Vodacom Way, that guides employee beh aviour.  
The Vodacom Way28 
To be ADMIRED, our customers need to see a company that is:  
¦ Customer obsessed. We are passionate about exceeding our customers' 
expectations. We show concern for the customer and take personal 
accountability for the customer experience.  
¦ Innovation hungry. We create and deliver new products, services and ways 
of working that delight our customers. We are constantly looking for 
improvements and better ways of doing things.  
¦ Ambitious and competitive. This is about bringing both e nergy and 
passion to our work and setting the bar high by delivering products and 
services that are best in class. We constantly review our own performance 
and then improve on it.  
¦ One company, local roots. We value our diversity and act inclusively. We  
communicate and use best practice, and we ensure that we make  the 
best decision for Vodafone (our parent company).  
For our customers to be able to look at Vodacom and see these four things, we 
need to have a consistent way of operating.  
We strive to operate with:  
¦ Speed. This is about driving speed to market and relentlessly prioritising 
and pursuing the outcomes that matter to our business. We analyse fast, 
execute faster and deliver with urgency. We won’t deliver things quickly at 
the expense of quality and safety.  
¦ Simplicity. We make things simple for our customers, partners and 
colleagues. We seek out simple solutions, focus our effort and stop 
ineffective activity. It is about challenging complexity and providing 
simpler solutions.  
¦ Trust. We are reliable a nd transparent to deal with. We act with honesty, 
integrity and fairness. We value the confidence that people place in us as a 
company.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
11.2.3 Taken -for-granted assumptions  
Organisational artefacts, values and norms give rise to assumptions that determine how 
employees operate within an organisation. When a solution to a problem works repeatedly, 
it becomes taken for granted. Such assumptions then become the core of an organisation’s 
cultur e as they define what to pay attention to, what things mean, how to react emotionally 
to what is going on, and what actions to take in various kinds of situations.29 Taken -for-
granted assumptions are ordinarily outside immediate awareness and thus difficul t to 
identify. This is one of the reasons why so many change programmes fail to make an impact 
beyond the surface.  
To conclude this section, it is important to note that although surface -level artefacts 
are highly visible, observers may interpret it differ ently when they apply their personal 
frames of reference. For example, if staff members dress, casually one observer may 
interpret it as sloppy, whereas another may see it as an indication of open -mindedness and 
creativity. When artefacts are considered in  combination with stated values and beliefs, a 
greater level of awareness can be achieved. However, organisational culture can only be 
fully understood if the underlying patterns of assumptions have been exposed and made 
sense of.30 In the next section, we  explore the cultural web as a tool to understanding the 
nature of cultural patterns and assumptions in organisations.  
LO 3:  Explain  the use of the cultural  web as an approach  to assess  an organisation’s  
culture.  
11.3  Cultural assessment  
Findings from a survey conducted by Deloitte in its 2016 Global Human Capital Trends 
Report, highlights the challenges that organisations face when assessing their culture. 
Results indicated that although 86 per cent of respondents rate organisational culture as 
important, a mer e 12 per cent of respondents believe that their organisation is driving the 
right culture. Assessing culture can be challenging given that most organisations ‘consist of 
multiple subcultures that vary from one operating region, business unit, or working te am to 
another’. ‘Even when organisations gain a snapshot of their culture, it isn’t static as culture 
evolves’.31 Diagnosing and managing cultures are further complicated by the number of 
layers within the organisational strategy as the ‘tone at the top’ m ay not always correspond 
with the ‘tone in the middle' or the ‘tone below’. In many cases, meaning may get lost in 
translation when statements, goals and expectations are conveyed through the different 
layers or levels of management within the organisation . In some cases, middle managers 
may choose to ‘either amplify or block upward and downward communications, and either 
resist or support programmes initiated by senior management’. Global operations may 
furthermore require local adaptations of strategic ob jectives and core values. Tension can 
also be created by the changing demographics in the workforce. An example  CHAPTER 11: ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE AND STRATEGY  
here would be the impact of generational difference on employee interaction in  the 
workplace.32 A recent study has found, for example, that intergenerational conflict in the 
workplace occurs as a result of different values, cognitions and behaviour expressed by 
baby boomers, generation X and generation Y who are all required to work  together to 
achieve organisational goals.33 Other demographic difference such as gender, race, sexual 
orientation, and religion may also impact on culture because they impact on the behaviours 
and styles of workers and leaders. In addition, digital techno logies and robotics are 
disrupting the world of work in terms of changing work processes and the way people 
interact with each other.34 
Despite the fact that organisational culture can be elusive, various approaches have 
been developed to help us look at it in a systematic way. A better understanding of cultural 
assumptions and practices can contribute to formulating strategy, as well as implementing 
strategic actions.35 A well -accepted approach to analysing an organisation’s culture is the 
cultural web. The cultural web shows the behavioural, physical and symbolic 
manifestations of a culture that inform and are informed by taken -for-granted assumptions, 
or paradigm, of a n organisation.36 The elements of the cultural web are illustrated in Figure 
11.3 and will be discussed in more detail next.  
The cultural web is a useful tool for uncovering the taken -for-granted assumptions 
that inform the day -to-day behaviour of employee s. Through assessing the elements 
contained in the web, management can determine where blockages to strategy 
implementation may occur.  
 
289 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
The elements of the cultural web are as follows:  
¦ The paradigm forms the core of the cultural web as it represents all the 
assumptions taken for granted in the organisation. At the mos t basic level, the 
paradigm represents the way of doing business. For example, much of First 
National Bank’s (FNB) success is attributed to an ingrained culture, based on 
innovation. This culture permeates through all staff members, encouraging them 
to exp lore new ways to offer and support financial services.38 According to 
S’onqoba Maseko, Head of FNB Innovators, ‘ innovation at FNB is not simply a 
slogan; it is a primary way of working in the bank. It challenges ideas and seeks new 
ways of banking’.39 as they recognise and reward innovations that could shape the 
future of finance and enhance the features that could ensure that their products 
and systems are truly innovative and enduring for their customers. The FNB 
Innovators Programme is testament to the b ank’s commitment towards driving 
innovation. Jacques Cilliers, CEO of FNB, says that since the introduction of this 
programme in 2004, over 9,000 innovations have been implemented. ‘Leveraging 
and focusing on new -age technologies, engineering and analytica l tools in support of 
our timeless purpose of  ‘helpfulness’ and putting customers first (business and 
personal), is at the centre of everything we do and stand for. It’s incredible to be part 
of an innovative organisation where people continuously look for  new and creative 
ways of doing things. I believe that creating a culture of continuous learning, 
encouraging people to think out of the box and driving a culture of innovations 
benefits our customers, our brand and contributes to the industry as a whole. This 
mindset of collaboration, integration and innovation is one that will continue driving 
us.'40 
¦ Routines are the ways things are done on a day -to-day basis within an 
organisation. Site inspectors at a construction company may, for example, inspect 
construction sites every morning before work commences in order to assess 
quality workmanship and evaluate the site’s safety. In contrast, rituals refer lo 
activities or special events that reinforce what is important in the culture. For 
example, EY (forme rly Ernest 8t Young, a multi -national professional services 
organisation) reinforce the expression of values in employees’ behaviour through 
their global awards programme, entitled ‘Better begins with you’. This award 
recognises and celebrates individuals and teams within EY who consistently live 
the organisation’s values and bring the organisational purpose of building a 
better working world to life through their everyday behaviour.41 
¦ Stories typically centre on important events and personalities. Similar to any 
good storyline, these stories include heroes, villains, mavericks, successes and 
disasters. Most importantly, each story has a lesson and is told to let people 
know what is conventionally important in an organisation. For example, stories 
often told  in the Shoprite group have to do with the challenges they had to 
overcome on the African continent. Whitey Basson,  
290 CHAPTER 11: ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE AND STRATEGY  
a former CEO of the group, relates a story of when Shoprite needed to send a 
consignment of goods from South Africa to Maputo, they had to fill in 1,600 
forms. To deal with this enormous challenge of bureaucratic red tape, the 
organisation adopted an approach of being Afro -optimists’ as opposed to Afro -
pessimists’.42 
¦ Symbols  refer to objects, metaphors, events, acts or people that convey meaning 
over and above their functional purpose. In the navy, for example, a metaphor 
often used is ‘the navy is a man’s world’. This refers to both identity (where 
people do masculine things ) and to space (a place for males only) and has 
manifested as part of the navy’s culture. As it is closely linked to notions of male 
dominance, it creates challenges for gender integration. One woman officer 
responded as follows to the question, ‘Is the na vy still a man's world?’: ‘No, but 
more than 50% of the men still think so’. Another symbol used in the navy is 
found in the way officers are addressed.43 
¦ Power is defined as ‘the ability of individuals or groups to persuade, induce or 
co-erce others into following certain courses of actions’.44 Power is not always 
associated with formal positions on the organisational structure but tends to 
belong to those closely associated with the paradigm.  
¦ Organisational structure relates to the formal roles and report ing relationships in 
an organisation, which will be addressed in more detail in Chapter 13.  
¦ Control systems are the formal and informal ways of monitoring and  
supporting people within an organisation. Strategic control  systems  
specifically will be discusse d in more detail in Chapter 14.  
It is important to note that the substance within the elements contained in the cultural web 
can come from anywhere in the organisational hierarchy. Key influences can be founders, 
strong leaders or staff members. Indeed, a healthy organisational culture is characterised by 
a willingness, on the part of all organisational members, to accept change and take on the 
challenge of introducing and executing new strategies. However, strong strategic 
leadership, which will be discuss ed in Chapter 12, remains the single most visible factor 
that distinguishes successful culture -change efforts from failed attempts.45 In the next section, we will review how organisations  can 
instil  anorganisational culture that supports good strategy imp lementation.  
LO 4:  Explain  how an organisation  can instil  an organisational  culture  that supports  
good strategy implementation.  
11.4  Instilling an organisational culture that 
supports good strategy implementation  
Organisational culture is central to management in general but specific to achieving 
strategic objectives.  
291 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Both strategy and organisational culture are embedded in dynamic environments and 
cope with complexity. They seem to be two sid es of the same coin  - combining 
stability from the past and flexibility for the future. But strategies cannot be 
implemented without culture being considered.'6 
When organisations consider organisational culture, they typically do so from one of two 
perspe ctives. The first perspective is to proactively shape a desired type of culture, for 
example, being highly innovative or having an entrepreneurial approach, which could, in 
turn, support and maximise their ability to achieve strategic objectives. The other  
perspective deals with identifying potential risks associated with their current culture, 
which could undermine their ability to achieve their strategic goals.47 
To shape a desired type of culture, Jeremy Bloom uses lessons from failures to 
reveal how org anisational culture can create a thriving business.48 This entrepreneur and 
philanthropist argues that a strong culture within a team is at the core of business success. 
Such a culture needs to recognise and embrace shared values, attitudes, standards, and  
beliefs that characterise the goals of the organisation. The culture should suit employees 
who work at the company while making a positive impression on customers and anyone else 
associated with the business. A strong culture is furthermore built by a rea lisation that it is 
people who make a business successful, and not only business operations. Emphasis should 
thus be on the contributions by employees to the realisation of the organisation’s vision. It 
is furthermore important that the founders, leaders a nd executives uphold the core values of 
the organisation from the very beginning. These values should be woven into the DNA of 
the team and inform the recruitment criteria of new employees.  
The cornerstones of a solid business culture include:49 
¦ Transparency. All employees need to know their responsibilities and the key 
metrics used to measure performance. Employees should also be allowed to share 
ideas and give feedback, no matter who they are.  
¦ Time to disconnect. Companies need to recognise work -life integration and the 
significance to allow employees a balanced lifestyle.  
¦ Empowerment and a sense of freedom. In many 21st centuiy companies, 
employees are given guidelines, instead of explicit and detailed directions. 
Innovation and ownership are no t encouraged through micro -managing but rather 
by the freedom to take on tasks, finding solutions and being connected to and 
woven into the company’s culture.  
¦ Physical space. It is important to consider the comfort levels and work 
requirements of employees  before office layouts are planned. Today, many 
employees are more productive in a virtual environment and do not need physical 
office space.  
¦ Talking to customers and employees. Learning what works and what went wrong 
requires insight from customers and em ployees. Talking to customers can help in 
refining approaches and improving market value propositions.  
292 CHAPTER 11: ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE AND STRATEGY  
Talking to employees can help executives to get a pulse on how the culture is 
doing. Making personal connections makes a difference.  
¦ Organisational design. If organisations are designed well, everyone in the 
business can do his or her job more effectively. The key is to clarify authority, 
responsibility and accountability.  
Unfortuna tely, not all cultures are strong positive cultures as organisational cultures can 
also become highly toxic. Organisations need the ability to recognise the indicators of a 
culture at risk. Culture is at risk when ‘the organisation’s values and beliefs are  not 
embedded or the ones that are embedded are not the right ones, resulting in behaviours that 
fail to respect stakeholders’.50 Warning signs include:51 
¦ When financial, sales, production, or other performance measures become the 
primary business purpose.  
¦ When undue pressure is placed within the organisation on achieving those 
metrics. These pressures may result in unethical or overly risky activities by 
employees.  
¦ When leaders fail to uphold the organisation’s values creating discord between 
the organisat ion’s image and how it operates.  
¦ When performance and talent systems that reinforce desired behaviours are 
misaligned.  
To gauge the health of an organisation’s culture, various indicators can be employed as 
discussed in the next section.  
LO 5:  Explain  the various  culture  indicators  that can be used  to gauge  the health  of 
an organisation's culture.  
11.5  Culture indicators  
In addition to understanding the elements that comprise organisational culture, 
organisations would benefit from considering a variety of indic ators that provide a 
dashboard of the organisation’s culture and various subcultures. These indicators include:52 
¦ Performance statistics. Unexpected variations in sales results, growth, product 
orders or cancellations may provide indicators of cultural pre ssures on 
performance.  
¦ Human resource -related statistics. Analytics on employee turnover, absenteeism, 
and the percentage of staff on extended leave may provide indications about the 
health of the organisation’s culture.  
¦ Feedback from other internal and external parties. Observations from the 
organisation’s internal auditors, external auditors, legal advisors, and other 
groups could indicate whether the organisation’s culture is at an optimal level.  
293 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
¦ Customer surveys. Information about the quality of customer service and the 
customer’s overall satisfaction with the organisation may provide insights into 
the culture of the organisation.  
¦ Whistle -blower programme. Important insights into t he organisation’s culture can 
be obtained through the whistle -blower programme or helpline.  
These indicators should be tracked over time and alarm mechanisms need to be in place to 
identify unacceptable variances. The chapter concludes with an overview of the key 
considerations in organisational culture and strategy.  
LO 6:  Discuss  the key consideration  in organisational  culture  and strategy.  
11.6  Key considerations in organisational culture 
and strategy  
Ultimately, culture comprises seven aspects and each organi sation needs a clear position on 
each one. These aspects are:53 
1. The marketing orientation of the company, in other words, the priority given to 
customers.  
2. The relationship between employees employed on different layers within the 
organisational hierarchy. This includes participation in decision -making, 
communication channels and the level of feedback between management and 
staff.  
3. The extent to which employees are target orientated and their commitment 
towards achieving performance goals.  
4. Attitude towards in novation. This is expressed in the company’s approach to 
taking risk and how they treat the success and failure of new initiatives.  
5. Attitude towards cost and cost reduction.  
6. Staff loyalty as expressed through attitude and behaviour.  
7. Reactions towards techn ology and technological changes and development.  
Each of these aspects has advantages and drawbacks on business paradigms but taken 
together, they confirm that there can never be one best or ideal culture. Culture needs to be 
flexible and adaptable to chan ging circumstances.  
Key considerations of culture, which are grounded in actions, agreed behaviours and work 
practices that are beneficial to strategy implementation, include the following:  
¦ Matching the organisational culture with the requirements of the strategy 
execution effort. This action can focus the attention of employees on what is most 
important to successfully implement the strategy.  
¦ Using strong group norms to create culture -induced peer pressure which can shape 
employee behaviour to do things i n a manner that aids the cause of good strategy 
implementation.  
294 CHAPTER 11: ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE AND STRATEGY  
¦ Accepting that an organisational culture that is consistent with the requirements 
for good strategy execution can energise  employees, deepen their commitment 
and enhance worker productivity.  
A strong and supportive organisational culture can thus promote good performance as 
almost all managers share a set of relatively consistent values and methods of doing 
business. New empl oyees adopt these values very quickly and the shared values and 
institutionalised practices can affect goal alignment, motivation and control positively.  
*************************************  
The big picture  
This chapter extended the concept of culture bey ond differences found on a national or 
ethnic level to consider cultures unique to organisations. Organisational culture explains 
how the taken -for-granted assumptions (or paradigm) shape the acting, sensing and sense -
making done by organisational members within the internal environmental context. Each 
organisation builds its own culture by adopting unique values, beliefs, principles and 
behavioural norms.  
The chapter furthermore recognised challenges organisations face when assessing 
culture, taking into account the various sub -cultures within an organisation as well as the 
intangible nature of taken -for-granted assumptions. Hence, the cultural web was reviewed 
as a useful framework through which to assess various cultural elements that may support 
or bloc k strategy implementation. To instil a strong positive culture, it was found that 
different approaches would apply as there can never be one best or ideal culture. Culture 
needs to be flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances. Organisational culture s vary 
widely in strength and influence. Some companies have deeply rooted values, behavioural 
norms and operating approaches that are widely shared. These standards are then used to 
regulate the conduct of employees and compliance is a key consideration d uring the 
strategic planning and implementation phases. In strong -culture companies, values and 
behavioural norms are so ingrained that they can endure leadership changes and are key 
considerations in strategic choices and implementation guidelines.54 
In d irect contrast to strong -culture companies, weak -culture companies lack values 
and principles that are consistently preached or widely shared. While individual employees 
may have some bond or loyalty towards the company, colleagues and/or managers, there i s 
typically no clear employee allegiance to what the organisation stands for, nor is there a 
good understanding about how things are done. In such a company, employees often merely 
view the organisation as a place to work and their job as just a way to mak e a living. As a 
consequence, there are no traditions, beliefs, values or norms that management can use as 
leverage to mobilise commitment to the execution of the strategy. Without a supportive 
work climate, managers are often left with no other option but  to use compensation 
incentives or other motivational devices. In these circumstances, a strong emphasis on 
controlling behaviour is often used to manage the lack of individual commitment.55 
295 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CON TEXT  
Summary of learning outcomes  
LO 1: Describe what organisational culture encompasses.  
Organisational culture can be defined as the accumulated shared learning of that group as it 
solves the problems of external adaption and internal integration; which has worked well 
enough to be considered valid and, therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct 
way to perceive, think, feel, and behave in relation to those problems. An organisation’s 
culture is not something that will develop overnight  
- culture evolves over time and it is the end result of accumulated and shared 
organisational learning.  
LO 2: Explain the various layers of organisational culture.  
Layers of organisational culture includes the following:  
¦ Visible artefacts  
¦ Espoused values and norms  
¦ Taken -for-granted assumptions.  
LO 3: Explain the use of the cultural web as an approach to assess an 
organisation’s culture.  
The cultural web consists of the following elements:  
¦ Paradigm. This forms the core of the cultural web as it represents all the 
assumptions taken for granted in the organisation.  
¦ Routines. These are the ways things are done on a day -to-day basis within an 
organisation.  
¦  Stories. These centre on important events and personalities.  
¦ Symbols. These refer to objects, metaphors, events, acts or people that convey a 
meaning over and above their functional purpose.  
¦ Power. This is the ability of individuals or groups to persuade, induce or coerce 
others into following certain courses of actions.  
¦ Structure. This relates to the formal configur ation between individuals and 
groups regarding the allocation of tasks, responsibilities and the authority within 
an organisation.  
¦ Control systems. These are the formal and informal ways of monitoring and 
supporting people within an organisation.  
LO 4: Explain how an organisation can instil an organisational culture that 
supports good strategy implementation.  
A culture that supports good strategy implementation is a culture that (1) recognises and 
embraces shared values, attitudes, standards and beliefs that characterise the  
296 CHAPTER 11: ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE AND STRATEGY  
goals of the organisation; (2) recognises that it is people who make a business successful 
and not only its business operations; and (3) weaves its values into the DNA of its teams 
and informs the recruitment of new employees.  
LO 5: Explain the various culture indicators that can be used to gauge the health 
of an organisation's culture.  
The following indicators should be tracked over time and alarm mechanisms be put in place 
to identify unacceptable variances that can be used to determine the health or a change in 
the health of an organisation’s culture:  
¦ Performance statistics  
¦ Human resource -related statistics  
¦ Feedback from other internal and external parties  
¦ Customer  surveys  
¦ A whistle -blower programme.  
LO 6: Discuss the key considerations in organisational culture and strategy.  
Finally, there are three key considerations in terms of organisational culture and strategy.
 These include the following:  
¦ Matching the organisational culture with the requirements of the strategy 
execution effort. This action can focus the attention of employees on what is most 
important to successfully implement the strategy.  
¦ Using strong group norms to create culture -induced peer pressure which can shape 
employee behaviour to do things in a manner that aids the cause of good strategy 
implementation.  
¦ Accepting that an organisational culture that is consistent with the requirements 
for good strategy execution can energise employees, deepen their commitment 
and enhance worker productivity.  
Discussion questions  
1. If you were to start up your own organisation, what would you tell new employees 
about the kind of organisational culture you would like to have?  
2. What core values would you engrain in your organisation’s culture? Why?  
3. Draw a cultural web for a company you are familiar with.  
4. Discuss the differences between strong and weak organisational cultures.  
5. Identify indicators that could provide insight into organisational culture.

referring to Steinhoff International, possibly the biggest case of 
corporate fraud in South African business history, and the best 
chapter to address the issue of corporate fraud is the chapter that 
addresses responsible strategic leadership.  
In presenting the Steinhoff case, we can find no joy in 
knowing that a company with a once clear vision, established by its 
founder Bruno Steinhoff, could end so catastrophically resulting in 
significant financial losses, not only by institutional investors and 
leading busi ness personalities, but by millions of ordinary people as 
well, such as the government employees who had pension funds   
invested in the company, employees, families, suppliers. The misery 
caused to people around the globe by the swift financial decline and 
uncertain future of the company and the painful effects of the 
company's reputational loss to many stakeholders is manifold.  
Strategic leaders have a number of responsibilities towards all 
its stakeholders and in this chapte r, we address this vital aspect of 
strategic management. We commence the chapter by differentiating 
between leadership and management, after which we address the role 
of strategic leadership in strategy implementation. Then we focus on 
responsible leadersh ip and the practice thereof. We conclude our 
discussion of the topic by also referring to sustainability and 
sustainable development. Figure 12.1 depicts the focus of this chapter

Case study  
Steinhoff International  
Steinhoff was founded in 1964 by Bruno Steinhoff, a West German, who saw an 
opportunity to procure low -cost furniture from East Germany and to sell it to his wealthier 
countrymen in West Germany. It was a game of arbitrage that helped shape Steinhoff as a 
core business strategy and it was one that the company vigorously pursued, enabling it to  
302 CHAPTER 12: RESPONSIBLE STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP  
become one of the biggest retailers in the world. Steinhoffs business was doing well, and 
he decided to diversify into furniture production, in line with his vision to grow, expand and 
own the supply chain and by 1980, the company's sales network included sales 
representatives in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and exhibitions were held in Englan d, 
the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland. During the global recession in the 1980s, the 
company started importing furniture from China, again in line with Steinhoffs preference to 
source low -cost furniture. The fall of the Iron Curtain in November 1989 presented the 
company with the opportunity for expansion in Europe - Europe became a continent 
without borders enabling the free movement of goods and services across borders and a 
united Germany. The new German government offered incentives for businesses  to invest in 
the former East Germany, where manufacturing facilities were mostly outdated and faced 
closure. Given its knowledge of and experience in East Germany, Steinhoff was in an 
extremely favourable position and the company bought out its East Germa n suppliers  
- seven upholstery factories and one bedding factory at very attractive prices. The result 
was that Steinhoff became one of the largest producers of upholstered furniture destined 
for the German market.1 
With the collapse of apartheid and the lif ting of sanctions against South Africa in the 
1990s, many international companies saw an opportunity to invest in the country. In 1993, 
Claas Daun, through Daun Ft Kie, bought a controlling interest in the ailing JSE -listed 
Victoria Lewis furniture manufac turing company. In 1995, the same company invested in 
another two furniture companies, namely, Gommagomma Holdings and Bakker Et Steyger. 
It was then that the paths of Bruno Steinhoff and Marcus Jooste crossed. Steinhoff and 
Daun had been acquaintances in Germany and Jooste was Daun’s CEO. In 1997, Bruno 
Steinhoff acquired a 35 per cent share in Gommagomma from Daun Et Kie. In 1996, Jooste 
floated the idea of merging the South African assets of Daun with Steinhoff Europe and by 
1998, Steinhoff Europe and St einhoff Africa (formerly Gommagomma) had consolidated 
their operations. Steinhoff International listed on the JSE in 1998. A few months after the 
listing, the company acquired the struggling Pat Cornick Company, making Steinhoff 
International one of the la rgest furniture manufacturers on the JSE. For the next five years, 
the company developed into a vertically integrated furniture and household goods 
business.2 
Steinhoff International was the epitome of a successful, global retail business. In its 
short 50 -odd-year history, it was able to make the transition from a small -time furniture 
company, which sourced low -cost furniture from eastern Europe and sold it into West 
Germany, to a truly global retail giant, boasting a fully integrated supply chain covering 
sourcing, manufacturing, distribution, logistics and retail. This was the result of decades of 
conscious decisions to expand, diversify and vertically integrate the business - a vision set 
by Bruno Steinhoff in 1964. Steinhoff operated in various business categories  
- decoration; furniture; consumer electronics; bathroomware and quick -fix essentials; 
kitchenware and appliances; clothing and footwear; beds and mattresses. Its brands were 
well recognised in the UK, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Its headqu arters were ln 
South Africa and it was registered in Amsterdam with the majority of the company’s 
operations being situated in Europe. One of the company's acquisitions that made news 
headlines was that of Pepkor from Christo Wiese, which served to acceler ate growth and  
303 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
to ensure the profitable transfer of the Pepkor business model into the Steinhoff network. 
In 2015, the company also acquired the Kika -Leiner Group and, in July 2016, entered into a 
50/50 joint venture with Cofel and acquired Poundland. Indirectly, in 2016, Pepkor also 
acquired GHM! and Tekkie Town. The most significant deal concluded by the company was 
the merger with Mattress Firm in the US. This merger created the wo rld's largest multi -
brand mattress retail distribution network and afforded Steinhoff the opportunity to enter 
into the coveted US market.3 
At its peak, and after making many acquisitions and takeovers, Steinhoff was part of 
the JSE Top 40 Index, the JSE T op 25 Industrial Index and the JSE Socially Responsible 
Investment (SRI) Index. In 2015, the company added to its financial credentials by securing 
a listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FSE). By 2016, Steinhoff was selling more than 40 
different brand s in more than 32 countries across four continents. Globally, it had 26 
manufacturing facilities, 2,500,000 m2 of warehouse space, 12,000 retail outlets covering 
9,000,000 m2 of retail space and a 4,000,000 m2 property portfolio. It was also shipping 
150,0 00 containers annually and employed approximately 130,000 people4. In 
2016,  the company posted revenue of €8.645 million and a net profit of €1.510 million, 
representing a year -on-year growth rate of 11.8 per cent. On 23 May 2017, its share price 
on the JSE was valued at R50.25, equating to a market capitalisation of R240.5 billion.5 
On the evening of 5 December 2017, the empire came tumbling down when 
Steinhoffs CEO, Markus Jooste, announced that he would step down from his position with 
immediate effect. The St einhoff board announced that the company had become aware of 
accounting irregularities requiring further investigation and subsequently appointed 
PricewaterhouseCoopers to conduct an independent investigation into the alleged 
irregularities, which had orig inally been identified by Deloitte. These irregularities related to 
off-balance sheet items and possible misrepresentations of earnings, although the extent 
and details of exactly what was meant by 'irregularities' have yet to be determined.  
Over the last few years, the dizzying pace of Steinhoffs acquisition drive aroused 
suspicions. What concerned many observers were the high levels of complexity associated 
with these acquisitions and the ability of the company to acquire ailing businesses and 
(nearly ins tantaneously) show improved results once these businesses had been 
incorporated into the group. More concerning, Steinhoff acquired businesses with no 
product disparity and had appeared to make no effort to integrate these businesses into 
their portfolio.6 
Currently, the company faces investigations or legal action instituted by numerous 
bodies and authorities, including the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), the Financial 
Services Board (FSB), the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), and the Companies a nd 
Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC). The company is also facing two different class 
action lawsuits in Germany and in Netherlands. Furthermore, executives of the company 
were brought before Parliament's oversight committee on finance and its Standin g 
Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa). German authorities are also continuing their 
investigations into current and former managers of the group for accounting fraud.7 
The repercussions of the December 2017 announcements, including the launch of 
various p robes into Steinhoffs financial affairs, have been catastrophic for the company. 
According to media reports, in the days that followed the dropping of the initial bombshell,  
304 CHAPTER 12: RESPONSIBLE STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP  
the company's share price fell by 85 per cent and by 11 May 2018, it was R1.60 per share. 
At the time of writing, many new developments - including the instituting of substantial 
financial claims against the company - were being reported. Whether Steinhoff will survive 
in its current or an altered form - or at all - remains to be seen.  
LO 1:  Define  leadership  and differentiate  between  leadership  and management.  
12.1  Leadership versus management  
Leadership is a topic that has fascinated researchers for a very long time. Conseq uently, 
various definitions of leadership are found in literature. Should you Google the term, you 
will find thousands of different definitions. For the purposes of this book, we will define 
leadership as a process by which an individual influences his or her follower or followers 
to achieve a common goal. In this simplistic definition, we are able to identify a wide range 
of implications of what makes a person a leader, as well as about the nature of leadership.  
¦ First, to be a leader, there need to be followers. Without followers, the term ‘leader’ is 
just an empty title. Being a leader does not depend on a formal appointment in a 
formal hierarchy or structure.  
¦ The second implication of this definition is that a leader is out front, setting the pace, 
determining the standard and direction of movement.  
¦ Third, the leader strives to build authentic relationships between people.  
¦ Fourth, the definition also implies that a leader is not necessarily an individual  
- it can be a group, a corporate body, an industry , or even a country. Lastly, the 
definition implies that the leader and the followers have a common goal. How often do 
we hear that the South African Breweries is the ‘leader’ in the brewing' industry, or 
that Apple is the ‘leader’ in the smartphone indust ry? Even countries can be 
considered leaders. For instance, Iceland is currently the leading country in the world 
in terms of renewable energy as it obtains 100 per cent of its energy from renewable 
sources, with 87 per cent coming from hydropower and 13 p er cent from geothermal 
power.8 Finland is famous for its high -tech projects and education systems.9 These 
companies and countries are leaders in exactly the same way as individuals are leaders 
- they have followers, they set the pace and direction, and th ey are going to where 
other companies and countries want to go. In other words - they lead.  
The definition of leadership points us to the primary difference between leadership and 
management - it has nothing to do with being a manager appointed in a formal  position. To 
be a leader, you do not need to be appointed in a formal position in a formal organisational 
structure. Some managers do lead their followers well, other managers do not lead at all. 
Being a manager does not necessarily mean that the Person i s a leader. Also, the definition 
says nothing about having to be a subordinate  
305 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
to be a follower. Following a leader is an act of choice or free will, as opposed to being 
pushed, pulled o r prodded. Positions of authority in an organisational setting are often 
called ‘leadership positions’, and thereby create confusion between management authority 
and leadership. However, leadership and management are not the same.  
How does leadership diffe r from management? Management and leadership share 
many similar characteristics and outcomes. However, the two terms also differ in many 
ways. Management and leadership are complementary qualities that are inevitably linked to 
each other. The manager, on t he one hand, is a person appointed in a formal position in a 
formal organisational structure or hierarchy. A manager commands subordinates because 
the position gives him or her the right to command. A subordinate obeys the manager 
because he or she is cont ractually obliged to obey. Leadership, on the other hand, relates to 
the relationship between a leader and a follower. A leader may command because the 
follower allows him or her to command. A leader influences, inspires, motivates and has 
various responsi bilities.  
John Kotter is regarded as a leadership and organisational change guru. Kotter10 
contends that organisations need both managers and leaders to be successful. Managers are 
needed to deal with the complexity in their organisations, by performing th e essential 
managerial functions of planning, organising and controlling. Leaders are needed to deal 
with and cope with change. In our definition of leadership provided earlier, one of the key 
aspects of leadership that we highlighted was the fact that lea ders are in the front, 
providing movement and direction. In other words, leaders guide organisational change. 
Table 12.1 lists the most important differences between leaders and managers in an 
organisational context.

Leadership, on the one hand, is strategic, focused on the vision of the organisation and 
involves a strong element of building trust and emotional engagement with followers.  
306 CHAPTER 12: RESPONSIBLE STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP  
Management, on the other hand, is operational, focused on goal achievement, and more 
directive of those who are managed." Leadership plays a key role in strategy 
implementation. The next section elaborates on this statement.  
LO 2:  Define  strategic leadership and explain the role of strategic leadership in  
strategy implementation.  
12.2  The role of strategic leadership in strategy 
implementation  
Strategy implementation involves organisational change (refer to Chapter 8 for a detailed 
discussion of organisational change). As expl ained in Chapter 8, organisational change may 
be incremental, but in some instances, revolutionary or 'big bang’ changes are necessary 
(see Figure 8.5 in Chapter 8).  
Organisational leaders fulfil an important role in guiding organisational change and, 
thus, in strategy implementation. It is only through effective strategic leadership that 
organisations are able to apply the strategic management process successfully. This bring 
us to the question of what strategic leadership is.  
Strategic leadership is a  process by which a strategic leader influences a follower or 
followers to achieve the strategic vision. Because strategy is about making choices, it is 
difficult to separate strategy from strategists. Kets de Vries12 identified two key roles that 
most suc cessful strategic leaders perform in organisations. These include:  
¦ The charismatic leadership role. This role involves setting up and gaining support 
for a vision and direction for the organisation. It also involves energising people 
and gaining energetic support for the causes that the leader, as a strategist, 
believes are important and worthy of being done. However, it is imperative that 
the causes that the leader believes are important, be moral, ethical and to the 
benefit of all stakeholders of the orga nisation - an issue that we will address in 
more detail in Section 12.3. Marcus Jooste, CEO of Steinhoff International at the 
time of the scandal covered in the opening case study, was described in retail 
circles as a ‘retail star’ who was ‘charismatic’. T o his credit, he led an aggressive 
international expansion and acquisition drive at Steinhoff International to build a 
giant which was unsurpassed in the history of South African business. He had 
loyal followers, such as Steinhoff fund managers and directo rs, who failed to 
remain alert to and exercise proper oversight. Typical of a charismatic leader, 
Jooste had fiercely loyal insiders who enjoyed social and other financial 
privileges through their close association with him.13 Sadly, the causes that he 
believed were important, were not moral, nor ethical, nor were they to the benefit 
of all stakeholders of Steinhoff.  
307 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
¦ The architectural role. This role entails building an organisation and a n 
appropriate organisational structure, a controlling and rewarding system. The 
architectural role of a strategic leader, according to De Vries, overlaps with the 
responsibilities of a strategic manager, as discussed in previous chapters of this 
book, whic h emphasise the point made in Section 12.1 that an organisation needs 
both - leaders and managers - to be successful.  
For a leader to be considered as operating on a strategic level, six requirements must be 
met:14 
¦ A leader must have the ability to build knowledge of the environment in which 
the organisation operates.  
¦ A leader must portray personal (or authentic) leadership, in other words, leaders 
need to possess a keen insight into their own self and be aware of their own 
strengths, weaknesses, values an d principles, and be consistent in their 
application of these principles, despite pressures that may encourage them to act 
in other ways.  
¦ A leader must have an understanding of the organisation and its processes.  
¦ A leader must have the ability to create a shared understanding and build learning 
and high -performance teams in the organisation.  
¦ A leader must feel comfortable with change and enjoy the paradoxes that change 
entails.  
¦ A leader must have a rooting in functional skills, such as marketing, 
procurement, human resources, operations, information technology, and so on.  
Researchers have differing viewpoints about the essence of strategic leadership. Boal and 
Hooijberg15 regard strategic leadership as involving the creation and maintenance of 
abso rpt ive capacity, adaptive capacity and managerial wisdom.  
¦ Absorptive capacity. Absorptive capacity was explained in Chapter 9 in an 
organisational learning context, where it was defined as the ability of an organisation 
to recognise the value of new, exte rnal information, in order to assimilate it and to use 
it to address business problems. In the context of strategic leadership, absorptive 
ability refers to the ability of a leader to learn - to absorb and understand new 
developments, and to be able to see  how they can be used in the organisation. Leaders 
must be able to learn in the process, and to change and reinforce the organisation’s 
actions. It is therefore important for strategic leaders to recognise that change occurs 
and that they must adapt to it.  
¦ Adaptive capacity. This refers to the leader’s ability to change in response to some 
change in the environment.  
¦ Managerial wisdom. Managerial wisdom combines properties of understanding what is 
changing in the environment and the significance that it hold s for the organisation. 
The extent to which strategic leadership is important in determining the performance 
and success of the organisation is dependent on the amount of latitude that the 
strategic leader has in his or her decision -making.  CHAPTER 12: RESPONSIBLE STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP  
This influences the potential for the strategic leaders’ decisions to impact on 
organisational outcomes and for the timing of their decisions to coincide with 
strategic crises points in the organisation’s life cycle.  
The term ‘responsible strategic leadership’ is becoming increasingly common across the 
global corporate community. In the following section, we address this topic.  
LO 3:  Explain  responsible  strategic  leadership  with specific  reference  to the three  
pillars thereof.  
12.3  Responsible strategic leadership  
In our discussion thus far, our focus has been on the relationship between strategic leaders 
and their followers, where followers are mostly subordinates. Responsible strategic 
leadership  goes beyond this notion and entails interaction with many followers as 
stakeholders, both inside and outside the organisation. Therefore, we can define 
responsible strategic leadership as the art of building and sustaining morally sound 
relationships with  all relevant stakeholders of an organisation.  
Responsible leadership is about making business decisions that take into account 
stakeholders, such as shareholders, employees, business partners, suppliers, the 
environment, the community and future generatio ns. Responsible leadership is a social -
relational and ethical phenomenon, occurring in social processes of interaction.  
The Steinhoff case study highlighted a situation affecting the lives of numerous 
individuals, organisations, shareholders, clients, busi ness partners, industries, countries 
and various other stakeholders across the globe. Disasters like these force us to think about 
the responsibility and accountability of strategic leaders towards all stakeholders. Today’s 
leaders act in a global stakehol der society, in which organisations are expected to be 
responsible and accountable, not only to shareholders for financial performance, but also to 
be accountable and responsible to all stakeholders for the organisation’s impact on the 
economy, the environ ment and society at large. In order to be viable and sustainable over 
the long -term, leaders need to ensure that they act responsibly and build (or in some cases 
re-build), not only the trust of shareholders, but also the trust of all other stakeholders. 
Responsible strategic leaders should be delivering on the ‘triple -bottom -line’ and create 
value for all stakeholders. The triple -bottom line is an accounting framework with three 
dimensions - social, environmental and financial. In this context, the environ mental 
dimension refers to the physical or natural environment. This can also be referred to as the 
pillars of sustainability, as depicted in Figure 12.2.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
 
Figure 12.2 The pillars of sustainability  
Such a view on the responsibility of strategic leaders, which is often also referred to as 
‘stakeholder theory’, starts with the assumption that values are necessary and explicitly a 
part of doing business. In the section that follows, we first focus on values and value 
creation in organisations. We then discuss the responsibilities of strategic leaders toward 
the key stakeholde rs of an organisation. Thereafter, we investigate the various roles that the 
responsible strategic leader needs to play in successful organisations.  
12.3.1  Values and value creation in organisations  
A personal value can be described as an individual’s absolute or  relative and ethical value, 
the assumption of which can be the basis for ethical action. Value statements are grounded 
in personal values and define how people behave. A value system is a set of consistent 
values and measures. Personal values provide an i nternal reference for what is good, 
beneficial, important, useful, beautiful, constructive, and so on. Values generate behaviour 
and help to solve human problems. Over time, the public expression of personal values that 
groups of people find important in t heir day -to- day lives lay the foundations of law, 
custom and tradition. An organisation can be such a group and needs to identify and define 
a set of values that represent the ethical ideals of the organisation.  
Strategic leaders play an essential role in  determining the values and a value system 
for their organisations. The values of the organisation should be the basis upon which the 
vision, mission, goals and strategic direction of the organisation are built. Effective and 
efficient organisations identi fy and develop a clear, concise and shared meaning of 
values/beliefs, priorities and direction so that everyone understands and can contribute. 
Once defined, organisational values will impact on every aspect of the organisation, every 
decision that is made , and every action that is taken. What is even more important, is that a 
strategic leader should ensure that organisational values are supported and nurtured.  
The values of an organisation will contribute positively to the success of the 
organisation, only  if the following occur:  
310 CHAPTER 12: RESPONSIBLE STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP  
¦ The vision, mission and goals are grounded in  its identified values.  
¦ All members of the organisation demonstrate  the organisational values  in 
action in their personal work behaviours, in every decision that they make, in 
every contribution that they make, and in all their personal interactions.  
¦ The personal priorities in the daily working life of every person are guided by the 
organisation’s values.  
¦ Organisational rewards and recognition are  structured to reward and  
recognise those people whose outputs embody  the organisational values.  
¦ All members of the organisation actively participate in an organisation - wide, 
value -based, shared culture.  
From the discussion above, it should be clear that strategic leaders play a vital role in 
creating value systems in organisations. They are also responsible for maintaining the value 
system and in aligning all other systems and the organisational culture with its v alues.  
12.3.2  Leadership responsibilities with respect to key 
stakeholders  
The strategic leader has a responsibility towards a number of key stakeholders, namely, 
employees, clients and customers, business partners, the social environment, the natural 
environment, shareholders and government.  
¦ Employees. Responsible strategic leaders mobilise people and lead teams across 
business, countries and cultures to achieve performance objectives derived from the 
strategic objectives of the organisation. In doing so, they coach and mentor employees 
to achieve objectives in an ethical manner. They ensure the implementation of 
employment regulations and standards; that working conditions are humane, safe, 
healthy and non -discriminatory; that the needs of employees fo r recreation, work -life 
balance and meaningful work are addressed.  
¦ Clients and customers. Responsible strategic leaders ensure that the products and 
services meet the needs of their customers, that they are safe and that real and 
potential risks are openly  and transparently communicated.  
¦ Business partners. In their day -to-day activities, strategic leaders are in contact with 
various business partners. A business partner is any individual or organisation who has 
some degree of involvement in the organisation ’s (or leader’s) business dealings, such 
as the organisation’s suppliers. Responsible strategic leaders ensure that their business 
partners adhere to ethical, environmental and labour standards. Moreover, responsible 
strategic leaders ensure that their bus iness partners are treated fairly and ethically. 
Woolworths is an excellent example of an organisation that ensures that their suppliers 
adhere to ethical and environmental standards. Woolworths acknowledge that 87 per 
cent of the world’s fish stocks are e ither overexploited or fully fished (according to 
the 2012 United Nation’s Food and Agricultural Organisation report). The state  
311 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
of the ocean’s fish stocks is a worldwide concern and overfishing will continue to 
affect marine life unless action is taken. Therefore, Woolworths is committed to 
procuring all their seafood from sustainable fisheries and from responsible farming 
operations. Woolworths is working with local and international  seafood sustainability 
and certification programmes to ensure that all their seafood is responsibly sourced 
and traceable back to the ship that caught it, or the farm that raised it. Furthermore, 
Woolworths has various programmes aimed at increasing aware ness of these issues 
and at assisting customers to make informed choices when they buy these products.  
¦ The social environment. Responsible leaders foster contributions to society. This can 
be in the form of passive actions (such as charity and corporate do nations), or active 
engagement in the well -being of communities. Responsible leaders should also 
endeavour to train and develop their staff in their understanding of the responsibilities 
of their organisations in society. Investec is an example of an organ isation that is 
actively engaged in the well -being of their community. Investec’s Corporate Social 
Investments (CSI) are central to the group’s philosophy of making an unselfish 
contribution to society. Their approach to CSI focuses on education and 
entrep reneurship. They believe initiatives in these two areas are the most effective 
way to create employment, wealth creation and socio -economic growth in South 
Africa. Their overall aim is to create opportunities for young people to become active 
participants in society. To achieve this, they recognise that there needs to be a 
continuum of initiatives, starting from high school, moving to tertiary education and 
continuing through to young adult learning. Their strategy can therefore be shown on 
a progressive ti meline, spanning three stages of personal learning and growth. They 
are passionate about empowering talented, hardworking individuals and in enabling 
them to realise their potential.16 
¦ The natural environment. Responsible strategic leaders are sensitive to  the world 
in which they operate and assess the impact their organisation's decisions and 
actions will have on the natural environment. They ensure that production 
processes are environmentally friendly, that they use ‘green’ technology 
wherever it is poss ible, that they recycle material and save energy. In South 
Africa, the Business Green Award recognises a business organisation that 
provides a service, product or programme that supports the growth of the Green 
Economy in the country. Five businesses stand  out for their care for their 
environment: Cape Flats LIFE, a green business and micro non -profit 
organisation that encourages the planting of locally indigenous and endemic 
flora; GreenFin Financial Services, which financed solar installation for 
househol ds; GreenTower™ - Eco-V, which designed an appliance that combines 
water conservation with energy efficiency, which is affordably priced to replace 
geysers; Locomute, which offers a membership -based car -sharing network that 
offers short -term access to vehi cles; Woolworths Good Business Journey, which 
focus on water, energy, sustainable farming, waste, transformation, social 
development, ethical sourcing and health and wellness.17 
312 CHAPTER 12: RESPONSIBLE STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP  
¦ Shareholders. In Chapter 1, we distinguished the terms ‘shareholder’ and 
‘stakeholder’. In the context of responsible strategic leadership, further 
clarification is necessary. A shareholder, on the one hand, is a person or entity 
that owns shares in an org anisation. Shareholders are entitled to vote for the 
board of directors as well as for a small number of additional issues, they receive 
dividends from the organisation and share in any residual cash should the 
organisation be sold or dissolved. Stakeholde rs, on the other hand, represent a 
substantially broader group, including anyone with an interest in the success and 
failure of the organisation. This group can include shareholders, but goes beyond 
shareholders to also include creditors, customers, employ ees, members of the 
local community and the government. Since shareholders own shares in an 
organisation, responsible strategic leaders protect the investment capital of their 
shareholders and ensure an adequate return on their investment. They respect the  
rights of shareholders, and provide them with timely information on the 
performance of the organisation. Furthermore, they show due diligence with 
respect to their own and others' insider knowledge. They prevent any moral 
wrong -doing and act responsibly w ith regard to their own compensation 
packages. Since the 1980s, executive pay relative to that of an average worker’s 
wage has risen dramatically in the USA, as well as in many other countries. Some 
observers are of the opinion that this rise is a natural and beneficial result of the 
competition for scarce managerial talent that can add to shareholder value. Others 
believe that this phenomenon is socially harmful which and has been brought 
about by social and political changes that give business executives greater 
control over their own remuneration. Executive remuneration is an important part 
of corporate governance, and the responsible strategic leader should acknowledge 
that. In 2016, Fin24 compiled a list of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange Top 
40’s highe st- earning CEOs for the 2015/2016 financial year. This list considered 
the total remuneration package of South African CEOs, including performance 
incentives. At the top of the list was Alan Clark from SABMiller, earning a total 
of R 122.8 million for the  2015 financial year, before the group merged with 
Anheuser -Busch InBev in 2016.18 
¦ Government. In any country, the government tries to preserve the community and 
improve its conditions. In this respect, organisations have to extend their co -
operation to go vernment. The responsible strategic leader will obey laws as 
determined by government, pay taxes, provide inputs to government in terms of 
technical economic -financial or political importance for framing appropriate 
policies, take up governmental projects and contracts, offers its leaders to assist 
government and work on different governmental committees. Lastly, responsible 
strategic leaders can also participate in politics. One of the most renowned 
successful business people, is probably President Cyril R amaphosa. President 
Ramaphosa studied law and obtained a B Proc degree in 1981 at the University of 
South Africa.  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
After completing his articles, he joined the Council of Unions of South Afri ca 
(Cosatu) as an advisor in the legal department. In 1982, Ramaphosa started the 
National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). He became the Secretary -General of the 
African National Congress (ANC) in 1991 and head of the ANC’s negotiating 
team that negotiated the  end of apartheid with the National Party (NP) 
government. Following the first fully democratic elections in 1994, Ramaphosa 
became a member of parliament; he was elected the chairperson of its 
Constitutional Assembly on 24 May 1994 and played a central ro le in the 
government of national unity. After he lost the race to become president of South 
Africa to Thabo Mbeki, he resigned from his political positions in January 1997 
and moved to the private sector, where he became a director of New Africa 
Investment s Limited. Ramaphosa was appointed Deputy President by Jacob Zuma 
on 25 May 2014. He was made Leader of Government Business in the National 
Assembly, responsible for the affairs of the national executive in Parliament; the 
programming of parliamentary' bus iness initiated by the national executive, 
within the time allocated for that purpose and ensuring that cabinet members 
attend to their parliamentary responsibilities. Following Jacob Zuma’s 
resignation as president in February 2018, he was elected unoppos ed as president 
of South Africa by the National Assembly on 15 February 2018.  
LO 4:  Explain  the practice  of responsible  leadership.  
12.4  Practising responsible strategic leadership  
Contemporary strategic leadership is embedded in a global stakeholder society (in other 
words, a society in which leaders take into consideration stakeholders around the globe), 
and in which organisations act as good corporate citizens. In order to do so, responsible 
strategic leaders play various roles. Maak and Pless identified the following roles that the 
responsible leader should play: 19 
¦ The responsible leader as a steward. A steward is a person that is employed to 
look after the passengers of a ship, an aircraft or a train. Contemporary 
organisations need to perform and survive in a more complex and fast - changing 
environment than ever before and require the stewardship of responsible leaders 
to look after them. These leaders must have a global perspec tive on managerial 
challenges, and a social and moral radar to assess the social, ecological and 
cultural environment to steer the organisation through challenging waters. They 
also need to cope with conflicting stakeholder expectations and ethical dilemma s. 
For example, shareholders might prefer better financial results, while customers 
might prefer them to take care of the natural environment. Lastly, the leader as 
steward needs to safeguard the values and value system of the organisation and 
protect the personal and professional integrity of the organisation.  
314 CHAPTER 12: RESPONSIBLE STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP  
¦ The responsible leader as citizen. Organisations are expected to use minimum 
input to create maximum output, to be effective and efficient and perform 
financially well. At the same time, organisations are expected to contribute to a 
thriving community and a good society. Therefore, organisations need leaders as 
active citizens that recognise that both these goals are connected to ea ch other. A 
thriving community needs flourishing' businesses and businesses can only 
flourish in a healthy community and healthy customer base.  
¦ The responsible leader as visionary. Leaders play an indispensable role in 
formulating the vision, or desired future, of their organisations. There is nothing 
more powerful for the success of an organisation than a shared vision that 
appeals to followers and all stakeholders. A responsible leader will ensure a 
responsible vision and build on an ethically sound not ion of balanced values that 
will lead to a sustainable business, ensuring financial success and the well -being 
of nature and society.  
¦ The responsible leader as servant. A servant leader is someone who shares  
his or her power with his or her followers, puts  the needs of others first and helps 
followers to develop and perform at as high a level as possible. Servant 
leadership has profound implications for the responsible leader. A responsible 
leader should serve others. This requires attentiveness, humility a nd modesty on 
the one hand, and on the other, a willingness and desire to support others and to 
care for their needs and interests.  
¦ The responsible leader as coach. Coaching can be defined as any training  
and development in which a person, called the coach , supports a learner in  
achieving a specific personal or professional goal. Coaching also implies the 
existence of an informal relationship between two people, of whom one has more 
experience and expertise than the other and offers advice and guidance as the 
latter learns. In times of ongoing change, the responsible leader needs to 
facilitate the development of their followers, enable them to learn, and support 
them in achieving their objectives. The responsible leader needs to integrate and 
motivate follo wers from various backgrounds to work together and to share and 
realise a common vision.  
¦ The responsible leader as architect. In the same way that architects do,  
the responsible leader needs to plan, design and construct organisational 
structures that supp ort the ethical and effective achievement and monitoring of 
the triple -bottom -line and the realisation of the organisation’s shared vision. For 
example, they design and implement a moral infrastructure by adhering to an 
ethics code, policies, guidelines, b usiness principles and audits; they ensure that 
human resources management systems such as recruitment, remuneration, 
promotion, disciplinary and grievance procedures, are based on moral values. 
Lastly, responsible leaders ensure that all systems are integ rated, co -ordinated 
and aligned to the organisation’s shared vision and overall goals and objectives.  
315 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
¦ The responsible  leader as storyteller and meaning enabler. An effective  
tool to support the creation of meaning and sense -making in organisations is 
storytelling. Leaders can use storytelling widely to spread the organisation’s 
vision of a socially, culturally and environmentally friendly business that aims to 
make a difference in the  world.  
¦ The responsible  leader as change agent. Leaders have the responsibility  
to act as change  agents, by initiating and supporting change by becoming  
value -conscious and sustainable businesses.  
Being a responsible strategic leader, also entails ensuring  the sustainability of the 
organisation and contributing to sustainable development. These two concepts will be 
addressed in the next section.  
LO 5:  Differentiate  between sustainability and sustainable development and explain  
the phases of commitment to sustainability.  
12.5  Sustainability and sustainable development  
According to the global Footprint Network, humanity is currently using Earth’s resources 
1.7 times faster than its ecosystems can regenerate, which is equivalent to using 1.7 
Earths.20 Our current demands on the natural environment are increasing at an accelerating 
and unsustainable rate. Biodiversity is frequently used as an indication of the state of the 
natural environment since it refers to the diversity of micro -organisms, plants and animal 
species, as well as to the ecosystems within which they interact and live.21 Biodiversity has 
dropped below a threshold that some scientists consider safe.22 But what does a decrease in 
biodiversity really mean for the natural environment, the economy, humani ty and 
organisations? As societies and the economy develop, we eat into our natural capital, which 
makes it more difficult to sustain the needs of future generations. Organisations transform 
the inputs they receive from the environment into products and se rvices, which are then 
returned to the environment. Thus, organisations use scarce and limited resources to create 
products and services that meet the unlimited needs of society. Unfortunately, the entire 
process comes at a price by damaging the environmen t and increasing the possibility that 
future generations will not be able to access the same natural resources as we do. This 
section focuses on sustainability and sustainable development as another area of 
importance for responsible strategic leadership i n organisations.  
What is sustainability in a business context? We can define sustainability as the 
ability of an organisation to continue to do business over the long term - and possibly 
indefinitely. But, most importantly, sustainable business is tied up with the impact that the 
organisation has on the environmental resources of the world that it consumes in the 
process. Sustainability suggests that strategic leaders need to critically consider how their 
organisations can reduce and minimise their impact o n the natural resources they use. By 
doing this well, business leaders can help to ensure  
316 CHAPTER 12: RESPONSIBLE STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP  
that their businesses will be around in the future, and that future generations will continue 
to be  able to support themselves and to flourish, thanks to the impact of current business 
strategies and practices.  
Sustainable development refers to economic development that is conducted without 
the depletion of natural resources. Sustainable development has  three core elements, 
namely:  
1. Society. This refers to people living in a particular country or region as a nation, 
where they share customs, common traditions, values, laws, activities and 
interests.  
2. The environment. In the context of sustainability and sustainable development, 
the environment refers to the natural environment, the biosphere in which 
humanity and all other life on Earth exists.  
3. The economy. This refers to a community’s system for using its resources to 
produce wealth.  
These three elements  of sustainable development as are all interconnected. Furthermore, 
these elements should be balanced - an organisation cannot pursue a profit maximisation 
goal at the expense of the environment or to the detriment of society. By the same token, an 
organis ation will not be able to survive in the long term (that is, be sustainable) if it does 
not make a profit to sustain its business. Every decision that the strategic leader makes, 
every project that is considered, should be done in a sustainable manner. Thi s means that 
the leader should link the economic, social and environmental components to strengthen it 
in totality.  
Organisations respond to the challenges of responsibility and sustainability, either 
by taking a position on or by moving through, six level s or phases of commitment:23 
¦ Phase 1: Rejection. During this phase, an organisation will focus on exploiting all 
resources (human and ecological) for the sake of maximising its profit. Strategic 
leaders here will not accept responsibility or listen to sustainability arguments, 
and will work actively against possible regulation or activism.  
¦ Phase 2: Non -responsiveness. Organisations in this phase are characterised by a 
lack of awareness or ignorance of sustainable or social issues, rather than by 
active opposition to these issues.  
¦ Phase 3: Compliance. Organisations in this phase are characterised by complying 
with laws and regulations to avoid risk, or by complying with self -regulatory 
measures to avoid legislation, which may limit their activities.  
¦ Phase  4: Efficiency. In this phase, sustainability is seen as a cost -reduction and 
efficiency strategy. Principles of sustainability are incorporated into the everyday 
business practice of the organisation.  
317 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
¦ Phase 5: Strategic pro -activity. In this phase, sustainability is viewed as 
potentially achieving competitive advantage, as well as ensuring cost 
efficiencies. Strategic leaders view sustainability as a strategic route to taking a 
position of leadership in an industry and thus maximising the returns of the 
organisation.  
¦ Phase 6: The sustaining organisation. In this phase, the organisation is committed 
to the principles of social and ecological sustainability, that are maintaining 
returns, bu t are focused on meeting the needs of the present, without 
compromising the opportunities of future generations.  
These six phases are summarised in Figure 12.3.  
 
Figure 12.3:  Phases  of commitment  to sustainability  
The level that an organisation achieves in its commitment to sustainability reflects the 
manner in which it treats the human and ecological resources that it utilises in the process 
of conducting business. An organisation does not necessarily progress through this 
continuum in a linear way, but may jump from one phase to another, or may regress 
depending on internal and external pressures. Obviously, the ideal for any organisa tion is 
to stay in phase 6, and to remain committed to the principles ol social and ecological 
sustainability, to maintain financial performance while staying focused on meeting the 
needs of the present, without compromising the opportunities of future gen erations.  
Being a responsible strategic leader entails accepting that you have obligations to 
the health of the organisation, to its employees, customers, the community and nature. 
Furthermore, a responsible strategic leader also recognises the challenges in terms oi 
sustainability and sustainable development.  
************************************  
318 CHAPTER 12: RESPONSIBLE STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP  
The big picture  
Organisations need strategic managers and leaders - managers to cope with organisational 
complexities and leaders to cope with change. All business decisions should be taken with 
the view to creating value for all stakeholders, delivering on the triple -bottom line, the 
sustainability of the organisation and sustainable developme nt. 
Summary of learning outcomes  
LO 1: Define leadership and differentiate between leadership and 
management.  
Leadership is a process by which an individual influences his or her follower or followers 
to achieve a common goal. Management and leadership are  complementary qualities that 
are inevitably linked to each other. A manager is a person appointed in a formal position in 
a formal organisational structure or hierarchy. A manager commands subordinates because 
the position gives him or her the right to co mmand. A subordinate obeys the manager 
because he or she is contractually obliged to obey. Leadership originates from a 
relationship between the leader and the follower. A leader may command because the 
follower allows him or her to command. A leader influ ences, inspires, motivates and has 
various responsibilities as a leader. Organisations need both managers and leaders to be 
successful. Managers are needed to deal with the complexity in their organisations, by 
performing the essential managerial functions  of planning, organising and controlling. 
Leaders are needed to deal with and cope with change.  
LO 2: Define strategic leadership and explain the role of strategic 
leadership in strategy implementation.  
Strategic leadership is a process by which a strategic leader influences a follower or 
followers to achieve the strategic vision of the organisation. Strategic leaders play a 
charismatic and architectural leadership role in organisations. The essence of strategic 
leadership is the creation and mainte nance of absorptive capacity, adaptive capacity and 
managerial wisdom.  
LO 3: Explain responsible strategic leadership with specific reference to the 
three pillars thereof.  
Responsible leadership is about making business decisions that into consideration al l 
stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, business partners, suppliers, the 
environment, the community and future generations. Responsible strategic leaders should 
be delivering on the ‘triple -bottom -line’ and creating value for all stakeholders. The triple -
bottom line is an accounting framework with three dimensions - social, environmental and 
financial. In this context, the environmental dimension refers to the physical or natural 
environment. These dimensions are also called the pillars sustaina bility.  
319 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
LO 4: Explain the practice of responsible strategic leadership.  
In practising responsible strategic leadership, the leader has various roles to play. These 
roles include:  
¦ The responsible leader  as a steward  
¦ The responsible leader  as citizen  
¦ The responsible leader  as visionary  
¦ The responsible leader  as servant  
¦ The responsible leader  as coach  
¦ The responsible leader  as architect  
¦ The responsible leader  as storyteller and meaning enabler  
¦ The responsible leader  as change agent.  
LO 5: Differentiate between sustainability and sustainable development and 
explain the phases of commitment to sustainability.  
Sustainability is the ability of an organisation to continue to do business over the long term 
- and possibly indefinitely. Sustainable business is tied up with the impact that the 
organisation has on the environmental resources that it consumes in the process. 
Sustainability suggests that strategic leaders need to critically consider how their 
organisations can reduce and minimise their impact on natural resources. By doing this 
well, business leaders can help to ensure that their businesses will be around in the future, 
and that future generations will continue to be able to support t hemselves and to flourish, 
thanks to the impact of current business strategies and practices.  
Sustainable development refers to economic development that is conducted 
without the depletion of natural resources. Sustainable development comprises three core 
elements: society, the natural environment and the economy. Organisations respond to the 
challenges of responsibility and  sustainability  by taking  either  a 
position on, or by moving through six levels  or phases  ofcommitment,  namely,  
rejection, non-responsiveness, compliance, efficiency, strategic pro -activity, and the 
sustaining organisation.  
Discussion questions  
1. Differentiate between the concepts of leadership and management and justify the 
statement that organisations need both of these.  
2. Inves tigate the key roles that most successful strategic leaders perform in 
organisations and discuss how leaders can use these roles to the detriment of an 
organisation.  
3. Explain the essence of strategic leadership.  
4. Discuss the pillars of sustainability.

The brief history of South African Airways (SAA), which you will read 
about in the case study in the chapter, highlights various changes 
(internally as well as externally) that impacted directly on the 
organisation and organisational structure, starting with the South 
African government's acquisition of Union Airways in 1934.  
During times of growth at the airline, for instance, during the 
‘jet age’ when SAA acquired 23 brand new Jumbo jets, the structure 
of the airline changed. For exa mple, new appointments were made 
and when new routes were introduced routes were restructured.  
However, during the era of political sanctions, flights had to 
be reduced and inevitably, further restructuring took place. When 
sanctions were lifted and SAA ex perienced times of regrowth, its 
services to former destinations were reintroduced, which once again 
led to restructuring. Since 2003, SAA has undergone several major 
restructuring programmes.   
SAA's structural adjustments, s uch as the most recent plan to operate 
the airline through three separate departments, were the result of 
changes in its internal and external environments. Internally, SAA had 
made a number of acquisitions, formed alliances and agreements with 
external co mpanies, and expanded its fleet of aircraft a number of 
times. Externally, it was influenced by political sanctions that had a 
negative effect on the airline. Environmental changes led to changes 
in strategy, and changes in strategy led to restructuring.  
In this chapter, we explore organisational structure and its role 
and place in the strategic management process. Organisational 
structure is dynamic and depends on changes in the environment. In 
the opening case study, we have seen how SAA underwent, espec ially 
since 2003, various major restructuring processes. In this chapter, we 
will also highlight the various organisational structure alternatives and 
applications of organisational structure. Figure 13.1 depicts the focus 
of this chapter.

Case study  
South African Airways1 
South African Airways (SAA) is South Africa's national carrier and largest airline. Its 
headquarters are in Airways Park on the grounds of the OR Tambo International Airport in 
Kempton Park, Gauteng. Currently, SAA flies to 35 destin ations worldwide from its  CHAPTER 13: ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND STRATEGY  
hub at the same airport. A brief history, highlighting the major changes and advances 
developments that affected the structure of the airline, is given below.  
The airline was established on 1 February 1934 when the South African government 
acquired Union Airways. Forty staff members and eight aeroplanes were engaged to form 
SAA, which was controlled by the South African Railways and Harbours Administration (now 
Transnet). SAA started charter operations in the same year. In 1935, the carrier acquired 
South West African Airways and also expanded its fleet. In the same year, SAA moved its 
operations to Rand Airport as it had become obvious that Johannesburg would becom e 
South Africa's aviation hub. In 1936, SAA took over all Rand -Cape Town services from 
Imperial Airways and again expanded its fleet.  
The period from 1946 to 1952 was a period of extreme growth. The first 
intercontinental service was introduced and there w as a spike in the number of passengers 
and the cargo carried, as well as an increase in fleet and staff. Air hostesses were first 
introduced in 1946. In 1948, Palmietfontein Airport became SAA's hub, taking over from 
Rand Airport. At the time, a host of ch anges were implemented with respect to its 
operations and services, and during that year, moves were introduced for the first time on 
its Skymaster aircraft.  
The period from 1953 to 1973 is known as the jet age in aviation. SAA's first jet 
arrived on 3 May  1952 in Palmietfontein after a 24 -hour journey, with five refuelling stops 
en route. In the 1980s, SAA acquired 23 brand new Jumbo jets, including the long -range 
Boeing 747SP, which was obtained specifically to overcome the problem of many countries 
prohi biting SAA from using their airspace due to the country's political environment at the 
time. In the 1980s, international condemnation of South Africa's apartheid regime presented 
SAA with many difficulties. For instance, the airline faced hostility, with t heir local and 
foreign offices being attacked. The US banned all flights by South African -owned carriers, 
including SAA. SAA’s flights to Perth and Sydney in Australia were also stopped.  
With the demise of apartheid in the early 1990s, SAA was able to rest ore its services 
to former destinations, introduce new destinations and expand into the rest of Africa and 
Asia. On 1 June 1990, an important date for SAA, South African companies signed a 
domestic air travel deregulation act. Flights to New York's JFK Int ernational Airport resumed 
in November 1991 when the US dropped the economic sanctions imposed on South Africa 
in 1986, and South African's planes were able to fly for the first time over Egypt and the 
Sudan. Flights to Milan were introduced for the first time and services to Athens were re -
introduced. In 1992, the airline entered the Miami market and re -entered Australia, flying 
directly to Perth.  
In 2003, media reports started surfacing about the South African government's plan 
to restructure and overhaul  the state -owned enterprise Transnet (SAA's parent company), 
due to dismal financial performance. This included splitting SAA from the company to 
operate under a separate identity.  
In May 2007, SAA launched an 18 -month comprehensive restructuring programme . 
The main purpose was to ensure that the airline would become profitable. SAA's business 
was streamlined, and employees were reskilled in a bid to improve worker morale and 
management/worker relations. SAA's business was divided into seven subsidiaries, a llowing  PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
SAA to concentrate on its core business of passenger and cargo transport; rationalising 
international routes (for example, Paris was dropped); reducing 30 per cent of the airline's 
managers, as well as implementing other employee retrenchments. The restructuring 
programme was expected to save SAA R2.7 billion. By June 2009, R2.5 billion was saved.  
It is no secret that SAA is in financial difficulty as it frequently makes news headline s 
as a result of mismanagement, its inability to settle debt with various banks and the 
implementation of further restructuring programmes to save the airline. In  
2017,  for example, SAA required yet another bailout and once again introduced drastic 
route restructuring. The airline reduced flights on its most profitable route Cape Town  
- Johannesburg, which allowed it to scale back its fleet from 50 aircraft to only 40.2 Sadly, 
restructuring plans such as these proved to be insufficient, and until 2019, SAA w as still 
struggling financially. By February 2019, their Chief Executive revealed plans to operate the 
airline through three separate departments, as part of a new major restructuring plan. The 
proposed units SAA plan to operate are domestic (which will fo cus on flights that operate 
solely through South Africa); regional (which will focus on routes and destinations across 
the continent with a heavy focus on southern Africa); and international (which will focus on 
the big, longer -haul flights that cross cont inents and travel the furthest afield).3 The success 
of the latest major restructuring plan remains to be seen.  
LO 1:  Explain what organisational structure entails and the role of top  
management in organisational design.  
13.1  Organisational structure and the ro le of top 
management in organisational design  
Organisations exist to achieve their strategic goals. These goals can be broken down into 
goals for various business units. The goals are often then further broken down into goals 
for the functional departments/areas/units of the organisation. Within each department, 
distinctions can be found between the jobs that people perform. Departments are linked to 
form the organisational structure of an organisation. The organisation’s structure gives it 
the form to fulfil its function in the environment. The term organisational structure  refers to 
the formal configuration between individuals and groups with regard to the allocation of 
tasks, responsibilities and the authority within an organisation.4 Organisational structure 
has three important components:5 
1. Organisa tional structure designates formal reporting relationships, including the 
number of hierarchical levels and the span of control (the number of people 
reporting to a specific manager or supervisor).  
2. Organisational structure identifies the grouping of indivi duals in departments and 
of departments in the organisation.  
3. Organisational structure includes the design of systems to ensure effective 
communication, co -ordination and integration of all efforts and outputs across all 
departments.  
326  
CHAPTER 13: ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND STRATEGY  
These three elements of organisational structure refer to both the vertical and horizontal 
aspects of organising. The first two elements are the structural framework, which includes 
the vertical hierarchy, whereas the third element pertains to the horizontal and vertical 
aspect, namely, the pattern of interaction among organisational employees and departments.  
The organisational chart is the (usually top -down) visual representation of the 
organisa tional structure, showing what positions exist, how they are grouped, and who 
reports to whom.  
Like organisational culture, organisational structure is an integral part of the nature 
and architecture of an organisation. If the organisational culture is con sidered the soul of 
the organisation, the organisational structure can be considered the body, which together 
with the bones, muscles, blood vessels and other physiological systems, enable the body to 
function. The organisational structure assists the orga nisation in distributing resources and 
in delivering its core products and services as effectively and efficiently as possible (refer 
to Chapter 1, Section 1.2, for a differentiation between the concepts effectiveness  and 
efficiency).  
It is a widely held v iew that the primary responsibility of top management is to 
determine an organisation’s goals, strategies and structure, thereby enabling the 
organisation to adapt to a changing environment. Middle managers are considered to do 
much the same thing for majo r departments within the guidelines provided by top 
management. The role of the top management team in terms of strategic direction, 
organisational structure and the effectiveness and efficiency of the organisation is 
illustrated in Figure 13.2 and explain ed in more detail below.  
 
Effectiveness and  r 
efficiency of  Strategic  direction  
organisational efforts  
 
Figure 1 3.2 The role of top management in terms of strategic direction, organisational structure 
and the effectiveness and efficiency  of the organisation  
327 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
The strategic direction -setting process involves an assessment of the opportunities and 
threats in the external environment (these issues were explained in Chapter 5). Also, it 
involves an assessment of the internal capabilities and strategic resources available to the 
organisation (explained in Chapter 6). The process of defining, re affirming and/or changing 
the mission and goals is a matter of determining the best  fit between external opportunities 
and threats, on the one hand, and internal competencies and capabilities on the other. In 
this light, specific goals and strategies are formulated by top management to define how 
members of an organisation are going to a ccomplish what is identified in their overall 
mission. The organisational structure reflects the way that goals and strategies are 
implemented. The strategic direction is achieved through decisions about structural form.  
This simplistic illustration of the  design of an organisational structure by top 
management, supports the notion that structure follows strategy, which is often attributed 
to the landmark work of Alfred Chandler. Chandler traced the historical development of 
large American corporations such  as DuPont, Sears and General Motors. His research 
indicated that strategy determines the various activities and tasks performed in an 
organisation, the technology used in an organisation and the environment in which the 
organisation operates, and each of these influences the structure of the organisation. 
Therefore, an organisation should adapt its structure to fits its strategy, rather than the 
other way around. However, in practice, it sometimes happens that structure can constrain 
or even dictate strate gy. For example, in the South African Broadcasting Corporation 
(SABC), retrenchments that were scheduled as part of the turnaround strategy were put on 
hold due to pressure from, inter alia, unions.  
Lastly, Figure 13.2 illustrates the effectiveness and eff iciency of organisational 
efforts as an important element of the process. Top managers need to evaluate the extent to 
which the goals of the organisation are realised. This can be measured in various ways, 
which we will address in more detail in Chapter 14 . 
It is important to note that in Figure 13.2, there is an arrow from organisational 
efforts back to an analysis of the environment and strategic direction setting. This means 
that strategies are often made within the current structure of an organisation. It may happen 
that the current structure does not support the new or changed strategies, of constrains or 
puts limits on goals and strategies. This will then lead to the need to restructure an 
organisation - a change in its structure for the purpose of a b etter fit between the internal 
and external environment and strategic direction.  
It is important to caution the tendency to represent the design of an organisation as 
a highly rational process which progresses smoothly through a series of steps such as tho se 
indicated in Figure 13.2. In practice, the design of an organisational structure is a messy, 
political process in which established routines and vested interests are challenged and often 
defended. Uneasy compromises are often found. Also, there might be  considerable 
discrepancies between how the design of an organisation is presented by its top 
management, for example, as a neat organisational chart, and how organisations operate on 
a day -to-day basis. In the opening case study, we saw the number of rest ructuring processes 
that SAA underwent, and still goes through. Why? SAA still needs to find a structure that 
will lead to the effectiveness and efficiency  
328 CHAPTER 13: ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND STRATEGY  
of its efforts, a structure that will get SAA out of its turbulent financial failures. The 
factfinders at Africa Check  conclude that between 1999 and 2017, R29 billion was spent on 
SAA.  The single biggest payment made to SAA during that time was R6.5 billion. A further 
RIO billion in  bailouts by the South African government has been secured since then, 
taking the total to R39.3 billion.  
There are also examples of organisations with a strong strategic focus that, with an 
appropriate organisational structure, achieve organisational effectiveness and efficiency. In 
Chapter 10, we used the example of Woolworths Holdings, a high -quality retailer which 
follows differentiation strategy. The practising strategy box below, highlights the group’s 
‘strategic focuses’, clearly indicating how t hey implement the differentiation strategy. It 
also emphasises structure, which further supports its strategy.  
Practising strategy: Woolworths Holdings 
Limited6 
Woolworths Holdings' vision is to be one of the world's most responsible retailers. 
The group's  values inform and underpin the way that they do business across the 
group. Their values state that they are customer -obsessed, inspirational, responsible, 
collaborative and committed to quality. As a group, Woolworths focus on the 
following, 'strategic fo cuses' that they drive at a group level:  
¦ Building stronger and more profitable customer relationships  
¦ Offering customers inspiring, engaging and relevant digital and in -store 
journeys, helping staff deliver a consistent, brand -aligned customer experience 
and connecting their customers seamlessly from physical stores to digital 
platforms and vice versa  
¦ Being a leading fashion retailer in the southern hemisphere and differentiating 
themselves on quality fashion that is relevant to their customers through 
clearly segmented, design -led, quality ranges and innovation  
¦ Becoming a big food business with a difference, focusing on providing 
customers with consistently superior quality, flavour, safe and innovative food 
at great value  
¦ Driving synergies and efficien cies across the group through ongoing 
interaction across business operations  
¦ Embedding the Good Business Journey throughout the business. The Good 
Business Journey is the group's plan to make a difference for their people, in 
their communities, and for the ir environment. It encompasses the issues which 
matter most to their stakeholders and enables a consistent approach to 
managing sustainability issues across their global supply chain. It helps them 
to achieve their vision to be one of the world's most resp onsible retailers.  
329 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
The ‘strategic focuses' of the group are clearly supported by its three major operating 
divisions:

Country Road Group, based in Australia and trading in Australia, New Zealand and 
South Africa. This division comprises County Road, Trenery, Mimco, Witchery and 
Politix.  
LO 2:  Explain  the various  organisational  structure  alternatives.  
13.2  Organisational structure alternatives  
Organisational structure evolves and changes over time - it is not static (we can again refer 
to the opening case study and recognise the many major restructuring processes mentioned 
since 2003). In the start -up phase of a new business venture, it may have a simple 
structure. As the organisation grows, it may make gra dual changes to its structure until it 
starts to experience crises in terms of who is responsible for what. Also, co -ordination and 
control problems may start to emerge, decisions may take too long and more mistakes may 
be made. When this happens, the grow ing organisation needs to be restructured - it needs to 
move towards a new organisation design. In a mature organisation, a change in strategic 
direction will create the need to change its structure. Such a process will repeat itself 
several times during t he lifecycle of an organisation.  
In order to satisfy its particular needs, the organisation will need to adapt a number 
of its structural types. Organisational structure involves more than simply charting where 
businesses, products, services, people and ot her resources fit in relation  
330 CHAPTER 13: ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND STRATEGY  
to one another. Organisational structures are dynamic and also involve behaviour patterns. 
The following forms are discussed:  
¦ The entrepreneurial structure  
¦ The functional structure  
¦ The divisional structure  
¦ The holding company structure  
¦ The matrix structure  
¦ The global structure  
¦ The network structure  
¦ The new venture units  
¦ The virtual network structure  
¦ The horizontal structure  
¦ The hybrid structures.  
In studying these organisational forms, you should bear the following in mind:  
¦ It is unlikely that you will find ‘pure’ forms of each of the structures discussed 
below, as organisations are more likely to use a hybrid or combinations of 
structural types to s uit their needs.  
¦ There is no such thing as a perfect structure - as organisations change in pursuit 
of their strategy or continuous improvement, structures will always be in flux.  
13.2.1  The entrepreneurial structure  
The entrepreneurial structure is typically built around the owner -manager. This form is 
usually utilised by small organisations in the start -up stages of their development. Figure 
13.3 illustrates the entrepreneurial structure.  
 
Figure 13.3 The entrepreneurial structure  
331 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
The entrepreneurial structure is entirely centralised and there is no division of 
responsibility. All strategic decisions are made by the owner -manager, and employees refer 
everything significant back to the owner -manager. All power, responsibility and authority 
lie with the owner -manager.  
The advantage of such a structure during the st art-up stage of a new organisation is 
that it enables the founder, who understands the business, to control its early growth and 
development. However, there are also limitations, such as the owner not having sufficient 
knowledge of certain areas. For insta nce, an attorney starting a new practice may not have 
sufficient knowledge of the financial side of his or her practice.  
Such a structure will only be appropriate up to a certain stage and size, and will then 
develop into other more appropriate structures.  
13.2.2  The functional structure  
In this structure, the activities belonging to each functional area are grouped together into a 
unit or department. One set of activities, for example, comprising advertising, market 
research and sales, will belong together under the marketing department. Another set of 
activities, for example debtors and creditors, will be grouped under the financial 
department.  
A functional structure is often used by organisations that have a single product 
focus. In order to build competitive ad vantage in their products or services, such 
organisations require well -defined skills and areas of specialisation. Dividing tasks into 
specialist areas enables personnel to focus on their areas of expertise only. However, this 
structure poses major challen ges in terms of co -ordinating the specialist functions. 
Specialists may view the organisation solely from their own perspective. The marketing 
manager, for instance, may see an opportunity or threat exclusively from a marketing 
perspective, whereas the fin ancial manager may approach the same issue from a purely 
financial perspective. To overcome potential conflict between the different departments, 
top management must ensure that proper co -ordination mechanisms are in place. Figure 
13.4 illustrates an examp le of the functional structure.  
 
Figure 13.4 The functional structure  
332 CHAPTER 13: ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND STRATEGY  
Decision -making in a functional structure is centralised. Advantages of this structure are 
that control resides with the top management of the organisation. This structure is also 
associated with relatively low overhead costs, clearly defined rela tionships, and relatively 
simple lines of authority and control. Such a structure can also promote competitive 
advantage through the various functions.  
However, there are also limitations attached to this structure. The organisation may 
experience successi on problems since specialists are not generalists and have to be created 
and nurtured. Specialised functions are unlikely to become entrepreneurial and the 
organisation may also experience co -ordination problems between the various functions.  
Once an organ isation has gone through the entrepreneurial stage and thereafter the 
functional stage, its choice of future corporate growth strategies will have a major impact 
on further structural developments.  
13.2.3  The divisional structure  
An organisation that chooses a divisional structure can use product groups or geographic 
regions as a means of divisionalising, or even a combination of product and geographic 
divisionalisation. Figure 13.5 illustrates the divisional structure.  
 
Figure 13.5 The divisional structure  
In the opening case study, the Chief Executive of SAA revealed plans made in February 
2019 to operate the airline through three separate divisions (domestic, regional, and 
international), as part of their new major restructuring plan.  
In the previous practising strategy box, the organisational structure of Woolworths 
Holdings was cites as an example of a divisional structure. The term M -Form (multi -
divisional form) is often used to describe such a divisional and holding company structure, 
which aligns an organisation according to individual divisions that are based on geographic 
divisions, products or services. Figure 13.5 illustrates a divi sional structure as a 
combination of product and geographical divisions. In this structure, divisions are likely to 
be seen as individual profit centres  
333 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
and strategic business units for planning and control purposes. Decision -making is 
decentralised. This divisional structure is appropriate when an organisation, such as 
Woolworths Holdings, grows in size and complexities, operates in a turbulent environment, 
offers a diverse range of prod ucts and/or services, and employs a variety of production 
processes. It is also appropriate when an organisation performs business internationally.  
The main advantage of the divisional structure is that profit responsibility is 
decentralised. This enables an organisation to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of 
various activities and functions. It also enables an organisation to adapt to changes more 
effectively and to foster an entrepreneurial climate.  
Such a structure also comes with limitations. Con flict may develop between various 
divisions in their competition for limited resources, efforts and resources may be 
duplicated, and the evaluation of the relative performance of the divisions may be difficult. 
As organisations grow and expand their busine ss globally, structural changes may again be 
necessary.  
13.2.4  The holding company structure  
An example of a holding company structure is illustrated in Figure 13.6.  
 
Figure 13.6 The holding company structure  
In a holding company structure, the headquarters of the organisation or the corporate centr e 
largely acts as an investment company. The operations of the various individual companies 
(companies A, B and C in Figure 13.6) are largely independent. This structure is 
appropriate for organisations pursuing a restructuring strategy, buying, selling or  taking 
over other organisations. It is usually effective in the case of diverse independent 
businesses in a conglomerate.  
There are financial advantages attached to the holding company structure. It usually 
involves relatively low central overhead costs a nd the holding company is  CHAPTER 13: ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND STRATEGY  
thus able to finance subsidiaries at a favourable cost of capital. Other advantages 
associated with this structure are that risks are spread between companies, it  allows for 
cross -subsidisation between profitable and less profitable companies, and it facilitates 
acquisition, divestment and decentralisation.  
The main limitation associated of this structure is that there are no centralised skills 
to support the organ isation. Furthermore, there is no synergy and also a possible lack of 
organisational culture and strategic control.  
13.2.5  The matrix structure  
A matrix organisational structure is a structure with a strong form of horizontal linkage in 
which both product and fun ctional structures (horizontal and vertical) are implemented 
simultaneously. The matrix structure combines the advantages of decentralisation with 
those of co -ordination. This structure requires dual reporting by managers. One manager 
can, for instance, re port to a functional manager (such as finance) and a project manager. 
Figure 13.7 illustrates an example of a matrix structure.  
 
figu re 13.7 The matrix structure  
335 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
As can be seen from Figure 13.7, the marketing specialist reports to both the marketing 
manager and project manager, the finance specialist reports to both the financial manager 
and the project manager. It shows the permanent and dual control of operating units. 
Authority and accountability are defined in terms of particular decisions.  
This structure is appropriate in large, multi -product and multi -national o rganisations 
with significant interrelationships and interdependencies. The advantages associated with a 
matrix structure are first and foremost that decisions can be decentralised within a large 
organisation which might otherwise be very bureaucratic. The  structure makes optimal use 
of scarce skills and resources, and enables control over growth and increasing complexity 
normally associated with growth. It also offers an opportunity for managers to develop and 
reach a certain level of maturity.  
Like all ot her structures, the matrix structure also has certain limitations. It is 
difficult to implement and the dual -reporting lines may create confusion among employees. 
Potential conflict may exist between various managers, it has high overhead costs and 
decisio n-making can be very slow. It is, nonetheless, a power structure to implement in 
organisations that have more than one profit centre.  
13.2.6  The global structure  
Becoming a global organisation is usually associated with multiple strategies. Multiple 
strategies need to be backed by a global structure that will enable the global organisation to 
sustain and maintain its competitive advantage. There are essentially five possible global 
structures:  
1. A globally centralised organisation. Such an organisation is remote f rom its 
global markets, but relying on exporting. This is likely to be a cost -effective 
structure, but possibly too out of touch for contemporaiy global entities.  
2. Manufacturing plants located close to the organisation’s markets. The purpose 
here is to sati sfy local needs and preferences. This structure is known as an 
international and multi -domestic structure, and can be controlled centrally. 
Another option would be to fully decentralise it into fully autonomous business 
units. The costs associated with thi s structure will be higher, but it will enable 
the global entity to offer higher levels of service.  
3. Centralisation of the manufacturing of key components. This is possible in a 
country where wages are low and where the final assembly is nearer to the 
marke t. 
4. An integrated global structure are chosen on the basis of available production 
locations chosen resources or on cost. In this case, finished products are 
transported to markets.  
5. A global network through strategic alliances. This structure can be very 
effective, but it can also be difficult to control and may have costly overheads. 
The network structure is discussed in the following section in more detail.  
336 CHAPTER 13: ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND STRATEGY  
13.2.7  The network structure  
The network structure involves an interrelationship between different organisations. A 
network organisation usually performs the core activities itself, but subcontracts some or 
many of its non -core operations to other organisations. One of the big challenges for a 
network organisation is to co -ordinate its network partners’ activities to ensure that they 
contribute to the network organisation’s mission and goals. Figure 13.8 illustrates the 
network structure of Nike, Inc., the American multi national company s elling footwear, 
apparel, equipment, accessories and services. The middle central hub represents the 
company that performs core activities only, and subcontracts non -core operations to a 
designer, human resources agency, manufacturer and marketer.

13.2.8  The new venture units  
New venture units consist of groups of employees who volunteer to develop new products 
or ventures for the organisation. These groups use a form of matrix structure. When the 
project is complete, it can be adapted to fit any of the following organisational structures:  
¦ The new products or ventures become a part of traditional structure, such as 
functional or product structure  
¦  The products are developed into a totally new department  
¦  The new products grow into divisions.  
337  
PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHER N AFRICAN CONTEXT  
13.2.9  The virtual network structure  
The virtual network structure builds on the features of the network structure. It becomes no 
longer necessary for the organisation to have all its employees, teams, departments and 
subcontractors in one office or facility. Information technologies enable the organisation to 
integrate its internal employees, teams and departments with its external network of 
subcontractors in order to achieve specific goals. In the virtual organisation, people, who 
are spr ead out in remote locations, work as though they were in one place. Therefore, we 
define a virtual network structure as a structure whereby an organisation subcontracts many 
or most of its major processes to separate companies and co -ordinates their activi ties from 
a headquarters organisation.  
The virtual organisation is a streamlined model that fits the rapidly changing 
environment. It provides flexibility and efficiency because partnerships and relationships 
with other organisations can be formed or disba nded as needed. However, a disadvantage 
associated with the virtual organisation is that the levels of reciprocal and sequential 
interdependence are much higher than those of the network organisation. They tend to be 
instantaneous - that is, at any time an d in any place - for the networked employees, teams, 
departments and subcontractors. The boundaries of the virtual organisation are also more 
open than in a network organisation because of the use of advanced information 
technologies that seamlessly knit a ll partners together.  
Practising Strategy: Remote control7 
Remote working is rapidly spreading beyond its traditional heartland of sales teams 
and field engineers. But what are the benefits of remote working and how can 
managers manage e -workers effectivel y? 
Both employees and employers can benefit from remote working. For 
employers, cost savings are very attractive (fewer desks mean smaller offices and 
lower overhead costs). Also, there is growing evidence of improved productivity and 
improved job satisfaction for remote -working staff. Fast, reliable broadband 
connections, remote security systems and web -accessible applications and network 
systems have never been cheaper and more available, making the practicalities of 
remote working easier than eve r for employers and employees. For many employees, 
remote working provides them with flexibility, greater fulfilment, high levels of job 
satisfaction and a better work/life balance. On the downside, remote working can 
cause remote workers to struggle with work/no -work boundaries, so switching off can 
be an issue for employees.  
The big unansv/ered question about remote working is whether remote 
workers can wave goodbye to promotion opportunities. Despite enthusiasm for 
remote working, some managers confess t hat visibility is important, as is being able to 
coach and mentor and influence decisions. It seems that managers need to 
understand that it is about the output of their employees and not about 
presenteeism, to take full advantage of remote working.  
338 CHAPTER 13: ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND STRATEGY  
13.2.10  The horizontal structure  
A recent approach to organisational types is the horizontal structure - a structure that 
virtually eliminates both the vertical hierarchy and departmental boundar ies by organising 
teams of employees around core work processes or projects. Organisations may be 
prompted to move toward a horizontal structure as a consequence of an intervention such as 
re-engineering. Re -engineering, or business process re engineering,  involves the redesign of 
core business processes with the aim to achieve substantial improvements in performance, 
productivity and quality. The business process refers to the set of interlinked tasks or 
activities performed to achieve a specified outcome.  It may involve the redesign of a 
vertical organisation along its horizontal workflows and processes, or projects. Re -
engineering aspires to change the way that managers think about how work is done. Rather 
than focusing on narrow jobs structured into dist inct functional departments, re -engineering 
emphasises core processes that cut horizontally across the organisation to involve teams of 
employees who work together to serve customers.  
An example of a horizontal structure is depicted in Figure 13.9. It applies to an 
organisation that has been re -engineered horizontally in terms of two processes, namely, 
new product development and sustainable procurement. Each of the two processes has a 
process owner. Each process will be conducted in various steps. For example, new product 
development will follow the traditional route of market research, product planning and 
design, product testing and then the manufacturing of the product for delivery to the 
customer. A number of teams will be involved in the various pr ocesses. Market research 
will be conducted by a team, product planning will be done by a different team, and so 
forth. Eventually, all the efforts of all processes need to contribute to the overall strategic 
direction of the organisation. Teams are self directed, meaning that people on the team are 
given the skills, tools and motivation and authority to make decisions that are central to the 
team’s performance. Team members are cross -trained to perform one another’s jobs and the 
combined skills are sufficie nt to complete a major organisational task such as new product 
development.

Figure 13.9 The horizontal structure  
A horizontal structure is a suitable structure for a project -based organisation. Project -
based organisations are organisational forms that create temporary systems for carrying 
out their work. Organisations that need and expect fast innovations are most likely to be 
suited to project -based organisations. Many organisation s, like those in construction and 
aerospace, organise their work by dividing it into various projects. In a functional 
structure, departments are created to organise work based on specialities such as 
marketing and finance. However, in a project -based orga nisational structure, most of the 
business functions are organised in projects. In a project -based organisational structure, 
projects are the main units involved in conducting undertakings. Typically, there will be a 
CEO at the top and managers of  
340 CHAPTER 13: ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND STRATEGY  
various departments reporting to the CEO. Reporting to these managers will be project 
teams consisting of various members, such as the analyst, architect, developer, and so on. 
Project -based organisations can be formed by different types of organisations including 
functional, matrix or projectised organisations.  
13.2.11  The hybrid structure  
In the real world, organisational structures do not exist in the pure forms we have outlined 
in th e previous section. Organisations often use a hybrid structure that combines 
characteristics of various approaches tailored to the specific strategic needs of the 
organisation. Most organisations combine characteristics of functional, divisional, 
geographi cal, horizontal or network structures to consider the relative strengths and 
weaknesses of these structures and the specific character of their organisation. One type 
of hybrid often found in practice is to combine the characteristics of the functional and  
the divisional structures. When an organisation grows large and has several products 
and/or markets, it typically organises itself into self -contained divisions. Functions that 
are important to each product or market are decentralised to the self -containe d units. 
However, some functions that are relatively stable and require some economies of scale 
and in -depth specialisation, are centralised at headquarters.  
The next practising strategy box illustrates the various changes in organisational 
structure that one of the world’s most famous companies, Microsoft, underwent between 
1974, when it was founded, and 2013. From the information provided, it should be clear 
that, although organisational structure is important and needs to fit with the competitive 
needs o f an organisation, it is only one determinant of its success.

PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Practising strategy: Microsoft8 9 
In 1975, Bill Gates and Paul G Allen founded Microsoft, deriving the name from the 
words microcomputer  and software.  They built the company into one of the world's 
most powerful and profitable companies in American history. The company was 
initially organi sed on a functional organisational structure. As it grew bigger, this 
structure proved to be too slow and inflexible for operating in a fast -changing 
technological environment. During this time, employees complained about a growing 
bureaucracy and slow dec ision -making processes, which led to a restructuring process 
in 2002 when seven business units were created. These were created around 
Microsoft’s major products and each was managed by a general manager. Each 
division contained most of the functions of a stand -alone company, including product 
development, sales, marketing and finance. Seven years later, the company was 
restructured again when the seven units were replaced by three core divisions. This 
restructuring programme was revolutionary because it ga ve division heads the 
freedom and authority to manage the businesses and to spend their budgets as they 
saw fit to meet their division's goals. Despite the restructuring, the company was still 
losing ground to other major role -players such as Apple, which was famously 
centralised in the hands of Steve Jobs, and to Google, which operates a loose 
structure with substantial employee discretion. In 2013, Microsoft embarked on 
another restructuring programme by dissolving its divisions and creating 'One 
Microsof t' - with the hope that this structure would enable the company to leverage 
its competitive advantages across different product categories.  
In the following section, we focus on the various applications of organisational structure.  
LO 3:  Explain  the variou s applications  of organisational  structure.  
13.3 Applications of organisational structure  
Each of the organisational structure alternatives highlighted in the previous section, is 
applied in different situations and is intended to address different organisational demands. 
Each type of structure can be viewed as a tool that can make an organisation more or less 
effective, depending on the exigencies of the situation and the capacity of the structure to 
respond effectively to the demands. In the discus sion that follows, we will focus on two 
important aspects in this regard, namely, structural alignment and symptoms of structural 
deficiency.  
342 CHAPTER 13: ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND STRATEGY  
13.3.1  Structural alignment  
One of the most important roles that top management has when designing of an 
organisational structure is finding the right balance between vertical control and 
horizontal co -ordination, depending on the changing needs of the organisation. Vertical 
control is associated wi th goals of efficiency and stability. Horizontal co ordination is 
associated with learning, innovation and flexibility (refer to Chapter 9, where 
organisational learning is addressed).  
An organisation with a dominant vertical structure will have the follow ing 
characteristics:  
¦ specialised tasks  
¦ a strict hierarchy with many rules  
¦ vertical communication and reporting systems  
¦ few teams and task forces  
¦ centralised decision -making  
¦ a focus on control, efficiency, stability and reliability.  
An organisation with a dominant horizontal structure will have the following 
characteristics:  
¦ shared tasks and empowerment of individuals  
¦ a relaxed hierarchy and few rules  
¦ horizontal communication and lots of face -to-face communication  
¦ many teams and task forces  
¦ decentralised decision -making  
¦ a focus on co -ordination, learning, innovation and flexibility.  
A functional structure is appropriate when management believes that efficiency in meeting 
organisational goals can be achieved through co -ordination by means of a vertical 
hierarchy. Divisional and matrix structures will provide a good mix between efficiency 
and learning, while a horizontal structure is more appropriate for when innovation and 
learning are priorities. The horizontal structure enables an organisation to different iate 
themselves and respond quickly to changes, but often at the expense of short -term 
efficiency. The virtual network structure offers even greater flexibility and the potential to 
respond rapidly to meet changing demands and challenges, as well as search ing for lower 
costs and increased productivity.10 
13.3.2  Symptoms of structural deficiency  
Periodically, top management needs to evaluate organisational structure to determine 
whether it is still appropriate to a changing environment and its strategic direction ( refer 
to Section 13.1, and the discussion of Figure 13.2). Many organisations test one 
organisational structure, then restructure in an effort to develop a better fit between  
343 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
its strategic, internal reporting relationships and the environment. The following factors 
are symptoms of structural deficiency:11 
¦ Decision -making is delayed or lacking in quality. Decision -making may be 
delayed due to too many managerial layers, decision -mak ers may be overloaded 
or delegation to lower levels may be insufficient. Decisions may lack quality 
because information may not reach the correct people or information linkages in 
either a vertical or horizontal direction.  
¦ The organisation does not respond  quickly and innovatively to a changing 
environment. One reason for the lack of quick responses and a lack of 
innovation is that departments are not co -ordinated horizontally. All the efforts 
of all departments must be co -ordinated horizontally to ensure o ptimal 
functioning of the organisation and ultimately, the attainment of strategic goals. 
In the context of organisational structure, ambidexterity refers to the ability of 
an organisation to be equally good at exploiting existing opportunities using 
exist ing capabilities while exploring and searching for new opportunities and 
new capabilities. In most organisations, the existing way of doing things tends to 
dominate management thinking, which makes it very difficult for them to be 
truly innovative and to d evelop new capabilities. In their research on this topic, 
O’Reilly and Tushman12 found that companies that are successful at both 
exploiting existing opportunities and exploring new opportunities (that is, are 
ambidextrous) separate their new, exploratory units from their traditional, 
exploitative ones, allowing for different processes, structures, and cultures. At 
the same time, they maintain tight links across units at the senior executive 
level. In other words, they manage organisational separation throu gh a tightly 
integrated senior team. This supports Clayton Christensen’s13 notion that 
organisations will find it very hard to harbour activities that are disruptive to 
their existing business in the existing organisation - the dominant management 
logic wi ll simply suppress those innovations and new ways of doing business. 
Christensen argues that it would be better to position such ideas and activities in 
a spinoff business that is not fully under the control of the old business and that 
is permitted to exp lore and be innovative. This is a prime example of an instance 
in which structure can directly support strategy.  
¦ Employee performance declines and goals are not being met. Employee 
performance may decline because the organisational structure does not provi de 
clear goals, responsibilities, and mechanisms for coordination. Also, individuals 
may not even know what the vision and strategic direction of the organisation 
are and where they fit into the ‘big picture’. The organisational structure should 
reflect th e complexity of the environment in which the organisation operates. At 
the same, it should also be straightforward enough for employees to effectively 
work within.  
344 CHAPTER 13: ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND STRATEGY  
¦ Conflicting departmental goals. In principle, organisational structure is intended 
to combine departmental goals into a single set of goals for the entire 
organisation. When departments are in conflict, or departmental priorities are 
out of alignment with those attrib uted to the wider organisation, it may be that 
the structure has incorporated insufficient horizontal integration linkages and 
co-ordination mechanisms.  
The big picture  
It is important that there be alignment between the strategy of the organisation and th e 
organisational structure it follows. However, it is also naive to think that there will be a 
pure and direct relationship between strategy and structure and that changes in strategy 
will lead unconditionally to structural changes.  
It is important to note  that organisations are generally inert until there are forces 
that necessitate change, and if these forces are not perceived as strong enough, large scale 
structural changes are not likely to occur. Developing an organisational structure is a 
complex matt er. In fact, there are very few organisations that would claim that they have 
an ideal structure. Structure is always a work in progress, and is, therefore, always 
evolving.  
Summary of learning outcomes  
LO 1: Explain what organisational structure entails a nd the role of top 
management in organisational design.  
Organisational structure (1) designates formal reporting relationships, including the 
number of hierarchical levels and the span of control (the number of people reporting to a 
specific manager or sup ervisor); (2) identifies the grouping of individuals in departments 
and of departments into the organisation; and (3) includes the design of systems to ensure 
effective communication, co -ordination and integration of all efforts and outputs across 
all depa rtments.  
Top managers are responsible for analysing the external and internal environment 
and based on that, determining the strategic direction of the organisation. Then, they need 
to design the organisational structure, and determine the effectiveness an d efficiency of 
organisational efforts in attaining organisational goals.  
LO 2: Explain the various organisational structure alternatives.  
The following forms are discussed:  
¦ The entrepreneurial structure  
¦ The functional structure  
¦ The divisional structure  
345 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
¦ The holding company structure  
¦ The matrix structure  
¦ The global structure  
¦ The network structure  
¦ The new venture units  
¦ The virtual network structure  
¦ The horizontal structure  
¦ The hybrid structures.  
LO 3: Explain the various applications of organisational structure.  
Two aspects are important in this regard, namely, structural alignment and symptoms of 
structural deficiency. In terms of structural alignment, organisations should find a balance 
between vertical control and horizontal co -ordination, depending on the changing needs of 
the organisation. Vertical control is associated with goals of efficiency and stability. 
Horizontal co -ordination is associated with learning, innovation and flexibility.  
Symptoms of structural deficiency are usually the following: (1) decision making is 
delayed or there is a lack of quality decisions; (2) the organisation does not respond 
quickly and innovatively to a changing environment; (3) employee perform ance declines 
and goals are not being met; and (4) there are conflicting departmental goals.  
Discussion questions  
1. Explain the concept organisational structure.  
2. Discuss the role of top management in organisational design.  
3. Differentiate between the various o rganisational structure alternatives.  
4. For each of the organisational structure alternatives discussed  in the previous  
question, explain the advantages and disadvantages of each.  
5. Explain the various application of organisational structure.  
Learning activities  
1. Conduct an interview with a manager in any organisation of your choice. The purpose 
of the interview is to get a sense of what organisational structure the organisation is 
using, and what the benefits and frustrations of their chosen structure a re. 
346 CHAPTER 13: ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND STRATEGY  
2. Consider these statements: ‘In practice, the design of an organisational structure is a 
messy, political process in which established routines and vested interests are 
challenged and often defended. Uneasy compromises are often found. Also, there 
may be discrepancies between how the design of an organisation is presented by its 
top management, for example, as a neat organisational chart, and how organisations 
operate on a day -to-day basis.’ Do you agree with this statement? Substantiate your 
answer.

N After studying this chapter, you should be able to:  
LO 1: Define strategic control.  
LO 2: Explain where strategic control fits into the strategic 
management process.  
LO 3: Differentiate between the various types of strategic  control.  
LO 4: Explain the balanced scorecard as a strategic control tool.  
LO 5: Explain risk, strategic risk and the strategic risk management 
process.  
LO 6: Discuss corporate governance with specific reference to the

¦ Ethical leader  ¦ Strategic surveillance  
¦ Implementation control  ¦ Sustainability  
¦ Premise control    
In the previous chapters of this book, we dealt with strategy 
formation and implementation, which bring us to the last chapter, 
'Strategic control and risk management’. The strategies developed 
during strategy formation have a long -term effect, they are resource 
intensive and impact on the entire organisation. This makes strategic 
control imperative for ensuring that the chosen strategies are still 
valid, that they are aligned with the vision and mission of the 
organisation and with the internal and external environment. 
Furthermore, strategic control is vital for ensuring that the 
implementation of the chosen strategies is on track. In the opening   
case study of this chapter, you will read about the implementation of 
strategic control mechanisms at Johnson 8t Johnson, with aim of 
determining the company's credo and mission. The first part of this 
chapter focuses on strategic control, where it fits into the strategic 
management process and th e various types of strategic control. We 
also explain the use of the balanced scorecard as a strategic control 
tool. The case study also highlights the risks that the JEtl Company 
were exposed to and how they successfully managed these risks. The 
second pa rt of this chapter focuses on risk, strategic risk and the 
strategic risk management process. The chapter concludes with a 
discussion of corporate governance. Figure 14.1 depicts the focus of 
this chapter.

products and services to advance the health and well -being of people. Employees of the 
J8tl family of companies work with partners in healthcare to touch the lives of over a billion 
people every day, throughout the world.’•2 CHAPTER 14: STRATEGIC CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT  
JEU's Tylenol pain reliever has certainly been one of the most successful products in its  
125 years. However, in 1982, when James E Burke was chairman and CEO, it also posed one 
of the biggest challenges to the company, as seven people died in the Chicago area after 
taking cyanide -laeed, extra -strength Tylenol capsules.  
JEtJ's handling of the Tylenol disaster is one of the prominent, and by now 
legendary, examples of good strategic contr ol in a crisis. As soon as the first death was 
reported on 30 September 1982, Burke took control and, in doing so, not only preserved 
the reputation of his highly respected consumer company, but also saved the Tylenol brand. 
At no point did he try to back off from the company's responsibility in the incident, even 
though it was later proven that the tampering had occurred at the retail level. 'When those 
people died,' said Burke, 'I realised there were some things we hadn't done right. 
Responsibility for th at incident had to be, in part, ours. It wasn't easy to take responsibility 
... but it was clear to us, to me especially, that whether we could be blamed for the deaths 
or not, we certainly could have helped to prevent them. How? Through packaging. The fac t 
is that the package was easily invaded. You could take the capsule out, open it up, put the 
poison in and then put the capsule back together. It was easy to do. I felt, and still feel, that 
it was our responsibility to fix it.'3 
Burke's conviction, and h is total commitment to the safety of the customer, resulted 
in the company spending $100 million on recalling 31 million bottles of Tylenol, which 
before the tampering, had been the company's best -selling over -the-counter pain reliever. 
The recall decision  was a highly controversial one because it was so expensive. There were 
plenty of people within the company who felt there was no possible way to save the brand, 
that it was the end of Tylenol. Many press reports said the same thing. But Burke had 
confiden ce in JftJ and its reputation, and also had confidence that the public would respond 
to what was right. It helped turned Tylenol into a billion -dollar business. Within eight 
months of the recall, Tylenol had regained 85 per cent of its original market shar e and a 
year later, 100 per cent. The person who tampered with the Tylenol was never found. In 
1984, J8tJ replaced capsules with caplets, and in 1988, the company introduced gel caps, 
which look like capsules, but cannot be taken apart.  
The basis for the s trategic control implemented by J&J, stems from the company's 
mission statement. On the company’s credo, written in the mid -1940s by Robert Wood 
Johnson, it stated that the company's responsibilities were to the consumers and medical 
professionals using it s products, employees and the communities where its people work 
and live, and its stockholders. Therefore, it was essential to maintain the safety of its public 
to keep the company alive.  
LO 1:  Define  strategic  control.  
14.1  Defining strategic control  
Strategic  control is a process used by organisations to control the formation and 
implementation of its strategies to ensure that they achieve the strategic goals that  
351 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
have been set for it. It is  a specialised form of management control and differs from other 
forms of management control (especially operational control). Strategic control focuses on 
the achievement of future goals. It involves tracking a strategy as it is being implemented 
- strate gic control systems cannot wait for a long -term strategy to be implemented before 
getting feedback on how well it is working, and whether it succeeded in attaining the 
goals of the organisation. This might take several years for some organisations. Therefo re, 
strategic control is concerned with detecting problems or changes in the strategy and 
making the necessary adjustments. Strategic control is a vital element in the strategic 
management process for the following reasons:  
¦ Strategic control provides a co-ordinating mechanism that links the strategic 
formation, implementation and control processes of an organisation.  
¦ Strategic control ensures that the organisation’s resources are deployed in such a 
way that it attains its overall objectives. Resources, i ncluding capital, machinery 
and equipment, human resources and finance, need to be allocated to different 
managers, functions and businesses, and then co ordinated and controlled to 
generate synergy. Strategic control also ensures that organisational resou rces 
match key success factors and the development of sustainable competitive 
advantage.  
¦ Strategic control enables management to cope with environmental change and 
uncertainty. Between the time that goals and objectives are formulated and the 
time they are  attained, many things happen in the organisation and its 
environment to disrupt movement towards the goal - or which may even change 
the goal itself. A properly designed strategic control system can help managers 
anticipate, monitor and respond to changin g circumstances. An improperly 
designed strategic control system can result in organisational performance that 
falls far below acceptable levels, and may even lead to the downfall of the 
organisation.  
¦ Complex organisations need strategic control measures t o ensure that costly 
mistakes are avoided.  
¦ Strategic ensures a balance between organisational effectiveness and efficiency. 
Effectiveness is achieved when the organisation formulates, pursues and 
achieves appropriate goals, for example, reaching the annual  sales objective. 
Effectiveness, in essence, means ‘doing the right things'. Given the reality of 
limited resources, effectiveness alone is not enough. An organisation also needs 
to be efficient. Efficiency enters the picture when the resources required to  
achieve an objective are weighed against what was actually accomplished. The 
organisation will be more efficient the more favourable the ratio between 
benefits (outputs or performance) and costs (inputs or resources) is. Efficiency 
essentially means ‘doin g things right’. Efficiency is achieved by using fewest 
inputs (such as the number of people employed or the amount of capital utilised 
during the financial year) to generate a maximum amount of output (such as the 
number of products produced or the profit  realised within a financial year).  
352 CHAPTER 14: STRATEGIC CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT  
To be effective and efficient, strategic control systems should comprise four elements. 
First, the strategic direction and goals of the organisation  should be clearly articulated. 
This element is part of the strategy formation phase of strategic management, which we 
have dealt with the first section of this book. Second, the strategic activities that need to 
be carried out in order to achieve the stra tegic goals of the organisations, should be 
specified and described. The third element revolves around the definition of the method 
used to track the progress of the organisation in terms of attaining its strategic goals. 
Tracking progress goes hand in han d with the fourth element, namely, the identification of 
an intervention mechanism to change or adjust organisational activities when strategic 
goals are not attained. The strategic control process is explained in more detail in the next 
section.  
LO 2:  Explain where  strategic  control  fits into the strategic management process.  
14.2  Strategic control and the strategic 
management process  
Figure 14.2 illustrates where strategic control fits into the strategic management process.  
 
Figure 14.2 Strategic control and the strategic management process  
353 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONT EXT 
Strategic control enables management to monitor strategic outcomes (or its corporate, 
overall performance) against planned or intended strategic goals to ensure that corporate 
activities remain on track and correspond to the set course without major discrepancies, 
while adapting to the changing environmental conditions. Environmental conditions refer 
to both internal and external environmental conditions. Should there be deviations 
between planned and actual strategic outcomes, corrective action shoul d be taken, which 
means that strategies could be redefined, and strategic goals and objectives changed. If 
there is no deviation between the planned and actual strategic outcomes, there is no need 
to change strategic goals and the organisation can continue  with its current strategy or 
strategies.  
In previous chapters (especially Chapters 5 and 8), we alluded to the fact that 
organisations face dynamic environments. Today’s success is no guarantee that tomorrow 
will be successful - organisations may need to change their strategies or may need to 
change the way that they implement their strategies. Strategic control is a vital component 
of the strategic management process - chosen strategies may become obsolete as the 
organisation’s environment changes. Strate gic control provides feedback and it may 
indicate that an adjustment will need to be made in order to realign the organisation with 
its strategic direction. Identifying and interpreting critical events or change triggers in the 
external environment that re quire a response from the organisation is not a straight 
forward and easy process. The external environment has become increasingly more 
complex - as we indicated in Chapter 5 - and it has become difficult and almost impossible 
to forecast. Even the best p lans of an organisation may become obsolete making it 
impossible to plan with any degree of certainty. Therefore, strategic managers need to be 
constantly aware of possible deviations from strategic plans in order to take corrective 
action. Therefore, stra tegic control has two focal points. First, to review the content of 
strategy, and second, to evaluate and control the implementation of strategy. In the next 
section, we will address the various types of strategic control.  
LO 3:  Differentiate  between  the various  types  of strategic control.  
14.3  Types of strategic control  
Four types of strategic control can be distinguished, namely, premise control, strategic 
surveillance, special alert control and implementation control. Each type of control 
provides a different  perspective and method of analysis.  
¦ Premise control. Every strategy is based on certain planning premises and predictions 
about environmental changes and conditions. Refer to Chapters 6 and 7, in which the 
context of strategy and strategic resources and capabilities are discussed in detail. 
Premise control is designed to check systematically and continuously whether the 
premises on which a strategy is grounded, are still valid. Should a planning premise 
no longer be valid, the strategy may have to change or be adjusted to reflect a 
changing reality.  
354 CHAPTER 14: STRATEGIC CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT  
¦ Strategic surveillance. This type of strategic control is designed to detect a wide 
range of events inside and outside an organisation tha t arc likely to affect the 
organisation’s current strategy. Various sources may be consulted, for example, trade 
magazines, journals, conferences, conversations with experts, observations, and the 
internet, which may provide important information that may influence the chosen 
strategy of the organisation. The organisation can then exercise surveillance for 
timely detection of developments and corrective action.  
¦ Special alert control. The management environment is often characterised by 
unforeseen events. Th us, the rigorous and rapid reassessment of the organisation’s 
strategy, because of the occurrence of an immediate, unforeseen event, may be 
necessary. For example, the acquisition of a company by a competitor may be an 
unforeseen event, which will trigger an immediate and intense reassessment of its 
strategy. In the opening case, the J8tJ faced with an unforeseen event during the 
Tylenol crises and needed to react immediately.  
¦ Implementation control. This type of strategic control is exercised as various 
activities, initiatives and programmes occur over a period of time when a chosen 
strategy is implemented. In other words, the chosen strategy is first monitored, and 
secondly, various milestones are reviewed. Implementation control is designed to 
assess whet her the overall strategy should be changed in the light of unfolding events 
and results associated with incremental steps and actions taken when implementing 
the overall strategy.  
The practising strategy box below provides an example of a strategy implemen ted by  
Edcon, which required implementation control over a period of time.  
Practising strategy: Edcon  
Edcon is a non -food retailer, which has been in operation for more than 80 years in 
South Africa. It conducts its business under four principal brands: Edgars, Jet, CAN 
and thank U. Since its establishment in 1929, it has expanded its footprint to include 
over 1,100 stores which exist in many different formats. The company's strategy is 
underpinned by four key levers: comparable store growth, new space gr owth, margin 
expansion and credit. It aims to improve revenue by growing comparable store sales 
and increasing new space growth, as it continues to roll out additional stores in South 
Africa and other African countries. It strives to leverage the benefit o f these increased 
volumes by improving the margin on sales.4 
For the past years, and in 2018, in particular, Edcon experienced a number of 
difficulties, especially in terms of its financial performance. Its operational results for 
2018,5 indicated 'a chall enging trading environment, characterised by weak macro -
economic conditions which undermined growth in consumer spending’.  
355 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Weak consumer demand, tight credit conditions, low consumer disposable income, 
lacklustre private sector employment, and political uncertainty in the first three 
quarters of 2018, as well as a restrictive fiscal policy, were mentioned as factors 
contributing to the company's poor financial results. The company also  faced 
increased price competition from established market participants, as well as from new 
market entrants. Business conditions remained very weak, placing pressure on Edcon’s 
sales volumes and profitability.  
Changing business conditions led to changes i n Edcon's strategies and 
structure. For example, the Legit business was sold, Edgars Shoe Gallery was closed, 
the company exited non -profitable international brands and store cost savings were 
achieved through the closure of non -profitable trading stores. The company also 
introduced a merchandise strategy of rationalising suppliers, rationalising ranges, 
introducing fresher inventory and more competitive pricing, which has improved its 
customer franchise. An increase in the company's retail gross profit mar gin and retail 
gross profit was achieved by better inputs costs, improved negotiated supplier rebates 
and discounts, as well as a through a reduction in clearance and promotional 
markdowns.  
Sadly, these control measures were not enough and Edcon is at a tu rning point 
yet again. The retailer has wrapped up a deal with 250 stakeholders, including its 
shareholders and property owners, in a bid to keep its doors open. The deal 
concluded in December 2018, will allow Edcon to renegotiate its store leases and 
bring in new shareholders. It follows a deal negotiated two years previously in which 
creditors converted the bulk of Edcon's R26.7 billion debt into shares.  
In essence, Edcon is asking the property owners for a two -year 'rent holiday' of 
41 per cent for all i ts 1,350 stores. In exchange, property owners will get a 5 per cent 
share in Edcon. Edcon's existing funders will convert R9 billion of their debt into 
equity while injecting another R700 million in the company. The Public Investment 
Corporation will furth er invest R1.2 billion into Edcon. Strategists and market 
analysists believe that implementing a turnaround strategy is a better option for 
Edcon than a liquidation strategy. 'We see a resurgent Edcon as a threat to most 
apparel retailers,' they say.6 
The balanced scorecard (BSC) was highlighted in previous chapters as a strategic 
management tool. For example, in Chapter 3, it was described as a tool to set strategic 
goals, metrics, targets and initiatives. In Chapter 8, the BSC was described as a tool that  
enables organisations to clarify their vision and strategy, thus making it possible to 
translate them into action. In the next section, we argue that the BSC can also be used as 
a strategic control tool.

LO 4:  Explain  the balanced  scorecard  as a strategic  control  tool.  
14.4  The balanced scorecard as a strateqic control 
tool  
Performance measurement is an essential part of strategic management. For example, 
strategic managers may introduce ne w strategies and innovative operating processes 
intended to achieve breakthrough performance, but then continue to use the same short -
term financial indicators as strategic control measures that they have used for decades 
(such as retum -on-investment, sale s growth and operating income). These managers, fail 
not only to introduce new measures to monitor new goals and processes, but they also fail 
to question whether their old measures are relevant to the new initiatives of the 
organisation. The BSC enables m anagement to monitor and evaluate organisational 
performance from four different perspectives to help determine whether their strategic 
goals are being achieved in a balanced way. These four perspectives are the financial, 
internal business, learning and g rowth, and customer perspectives. Within each 
perspective, managers can choose various measures. The BSC complements traditional 
financial indicators (such as return -on-investment, sales growth and operating income) 
with measures of performance for custome rs, internal processes, and innovation and 
improvement activities. These measures differ from those traditionally used by 
organisations in a few important ways:7 
¦ The scorecard’s measures are grounded in an organisation’s strategic objectives 
and competitiv e demands. By requiring managers to select a limited number of 
critical indicators within each of the four perspectives, the scorecard helps focus 
this strategic vision.  
¦ While traditional financial measures report on what happened during the last 
period, without indicating how managers can improve performance in the next 
period, the scorecard functions as the cornerstone of an organisation’s current 
and future success.  
¦ Unlike conventional metrics, the information from the four perspectives provides 
a balan ce between external measures, such as operating income and internal 
measures such as product development.  
¦ The BSC offers a benchmark against which all new projects and business are 
evaluated, especially for organisations that implement improvement plans su ch 
as business process re -engineering, total quality and employee empowerment 
and that needs a sense of integration.  
The practising strategy box below illustrates how the BSC can be used as a strategic 
control tool.  
357 PRACTISING STRATEG Y: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
In the context of strategic management, we can define strategic risk as an uncertain future 
event or set of events which, should it occur, could have an effect (in both a negative and 
a positive manner) on the achievement of the strategic objectives of the organisation. A 
strategic risk is the combination of the probability of the future event (or set of events) 
and its consequence. It is important to note that a strategic risk arises as much from 
failing to capture business o pportunities when pursuing strategic objectives as it does 
from a threat that something bad will happen. There are numerous examples of strategic 
risks that can have an influence on the attainment of strategic objectives and performance. 
Strategic risks mi ght arise from the internal and external management environment. 
Examples of strategic risks that arise internally are making poor business decisions, 
substandard execution of decisions, inadequate resource allocation, and failure to respond 
well to change s in the business environment. Example of strategic risks that arise 
externally are competitors making ‘moves’ - they may introduce new products, enter new 
markets, use new technologies or use new marketing strategies. New regulations may also 
have an impa ct on the organisation, forcing it to revisit or change its strategies. Various 
political events may also force an organisation to adapt or change it strategies. Social 
changes, changes in the tastes or buying patterns of customers and new technologies are  
all examples of risk factors affecting corporate performance and strategy.  
The question that we need to ask at this point is what is strategic risk management 
and where does it fit in the strategic management process? Figure 14.4 depicts an 
integrated str ategic risk management framework and provides an indication of where 
strategic risk management fits into the strategic management process.  
An effective strategic risk management approach requires an appropriate 
organisational structure comprising responsib le leadership and governance, systems, 
structure, technology, capabilities, and culture. We have dealt with all these issues (except 
for corporate governance) in previous chapters as elements or components of 
organisational architecture. The last section o f this chapter will therefore focus on 
corporate governance.  
Strategic risk management is at the centre of the integrated strategic risk 
management framework shown in Figure 14.4. Strategic risk management can be defined 
as the identification and evaluatio n of actual and potential risk areas as they pertain to an 
organisation as a total entity, followed by a process of either avoidance, termination, 
transfer, tolerance (acceptance), exploitation, or mitigation (treatment) of each risk, or a 
response that is  a combination or integration of these. It is important to note that 
organisations will always be exposed to some form of risk and can only reap rewards 
should they take risks. However, the acceptance of risks should be informed, calculated 
and managed. Th ree steps in the strategic risk management process can be distinguished, 
namely, risk identification, risk analysis and lastly, risk evaluation and response, as 
illustrated in Figure 14.5.

361 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Step 7: Risk identification  
Risks pertaining to the organisation are identified in terms of potential losses or gains 
(opportunities or threats). A focus on significant risk factors, combined with insight about 
the organisational activities, should provide an understanding of how different events may 
affect the ability to achieve longer -term objectives in view of identified opportunities and 
threats. It is pos sible that different organisations may view these events and their impact 
differently. Hence, it is imperative to develop a shared understanding of major 
organisational risk exposures and the interrelatedness in a way that is adapted to the 
specific enviro nmental conditions. Adopting a common risk management framework can 
underpin a consistent examination of organisational exposures and allow for cross -
functional comparisons when assessing the aggregate organisational exposures. 
Organisational disruptions c an typically arise along the organisational value chain and 
particularly in the interfaces between different functional units within a larger operational 
system. These internal processing conditions can affect the generation of cash flows, both 
in terms of  operating expenses and sales revenue and may provide a good basis for 
understanding vulnerable business activities and identifying opportunities for 
improvement. The identification of organisational risks may be supported by a common 
classification scheme  that makes it easier to compare and communicate information about 
insights about major exposures.  
Step 2: Risk analyses  
Risk analysis refers to the systematic use of information to identify sources and to 
estimate strategic risks. Risk analysis provides a  basis for risk evaluation, the treatment of 
risk and risk acceptance. The information used to analyse risk can include historical data, 
theoretical analysis, informed opinions and the concerns of relevant stakeholders.  
Step 3: Risk evaluation and response s 
After the risks have been identified and analysed, they should be evaluated in terms of the 
likelihood that the event will occur. The potential economic impact also needs to be 
established. This approach must be supported by objective assessment criteria . The likely 
outcome must be compared with strategic objectives. In so doing, the organisation can 
determine which of the potential outcomes are mission critical and whether the excess 
exposure should be modified. This should assist the organisation to foc us on the priority 
risks that need to be managed. Consequently, strategic managers can decide on a risk 
response - measures to modify risk. The latter include measures to prevent, transfer, 
tolerate, exploit or mitigate risks at the strategic level, rather  than to make these decisions 
on a narrow or standalone basis. Risk avoidance refers to the decision not to become 
involved in, or action to withdraw from, a risk situation. Risk transfer refers to sharing 
with another party the burden of loss or benefit o f gain, for a particular risk. Risk transfer 
can be carried out through insurance of other agreements. Risk acceptance refers to the 
decision to accept the risk. Risk exploitation refers to a situation in which a particular 
event or risk has a  
362 CHAPTER 14: STRATEGIC CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT  
positive consequence on the organisations and relevant stakeholders and should then be 
exploited. Risk mitigation refers to the limitation of any negative consequence of a 
particular even t. 
In conclusion, we must bear in mind that the integrated strategic risk management 
framework is designed as a control framework that should comply with regulatory 
requirements. Although compliance is important, the integrated risk management 
framework ad vocates that risk be dealt with in the context of the organisation’s strategy to 
accomplish the organisation’s strategic objectives, and that priority be given to controls. 
As indicated in the integrated strategic risk management framework, corporate gover nance 
is an essential component thereof. The last section in this chapter focuses on corporate 
governance.  
LO 6:  Discuss  corporate  governance  with  specific  reference  to the three  value  
dimensions thereof.  
14.6 Corporate governance  
Major risk events have made news headlines in recent years, and consequently there has 
been an increased focus on strategic risk. We need only think of the Steinhoff 
International scandal which occurred towards the end of 2017, when the company’s share 
price plummeted by 61 per cent in the first three hours of trading on the Johannesburg 
Stock Exchange (JSE), constituting the biggest collapse in the history of the JSE. More 
than US$13 billion was wiped out and its share prices also plummeted on the Frankfurt 
Stock Exchange. Stein hoff is a South African international retail holding company that is 
dual listed in Germany. The plummeting share price followed the revelation that Steinhoff 
was being investigated by German regulators for ‘irregularities and non -disclosures 
relating to i ts acquisitions’.10 The underlying causes of these events are frequently related 
to internal controls, including integrity and personal accountability of corporate 
executives.  
In a response to these risk events, new regulatory frameworks have been 
implemen ted worldwide to scrutinise business practices intended to strengthen internal 
controls (for example, the King Reports in South Africa, and Sarbanes Oxley in the USA). 
Hence, a renewed focus has been placed on risk management, with routine system errors, 
operational malfunctions, uncontrollable employees and personal accountability at the 
centre of attention. These compliance measures are not intended to serve as a mere 
checklist, containing ticks to show that executives were responsible and ethical, but to  
empower organisations to introduce formal practices of effective and efficient internal 
controls and personal accountability that allow for greater scrutiny of internal processes 
and reporting systems. As such, organisations can pro -actively respond in in novative ways 
to changes in the dynamic environment in which they operate, to ensure their sustained 
long -term survival and growth.  
363 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Corporate governance can be defined as a framework of rules and practices by which a 
board of directors ensures accountability, fairness, and transparency in an organisation’s 
relationship with all its stakeholders. The corporate governance framework consists of (1) 
explicit and implicit contracts between the  organisation and the stakeholders for the 
distribution of responsibilities, rights, and rewards; (2) procedures for reconciling the 
sometimes conflicting interests of stakeholders in accordance with their duties, privileges, 
and roles; and (3) procedures for proper supervision, control, and information -flows to 
serve as a system of checks -and- balances.11 
Good corporate governance increases the integrity and effectiveness of the private 
sector. Good corporate governance also helps to prevent business scand als which damage 
trust in business. It places value on good corporate governance by institutional investors. 
Good corporate governance also fosters a growing involvement of the private sector in 
service delivery and enhances the development of systems to p revent and deter corruption 
in developing countries. It assists in the deregulation and integration of capital markets 
and recognises the importance of harnessing domestic savings for domestic growth.  
The Institute of Directors in South Africa (IoDSA) esta blished the King Committee 
on Corporate Governance in July 1993. The King Committee produced the first King 
Report on Corporate Governance in November 1994. This report was recognised 
internationally as the most comprehensive publication embracing the incl usive approach to 
corporate governance. Since the publication of the first report, it has been revised three 
times. The King IV Report on Corporate Governance for South Africa was released on 1 
November 2016 and became effective in April 2017.12 It applies  to entities incorporated in 
and resident in South Africa. The report spells out the framework for governance 
compliance. The philosophy of the report revolves around three issues, namely, ethical 
leadership, sustainability and corporate citizenship, which  is referred to as the ‘value 
dimensions of the report’. These dimensions are briefly explained below.  
¦ Corporate citizenship. Corporate citizenship centres around a concern for people, the 
planet and profit issues. Defined formally, corporate citizenship e ntails a concern for 
the social, environmental and economic performance of the organisation and a 
concern for the role, scope and purpose of the organisation. According to the King 
Report,13 corporate citizenship implies an ethical relationship of responsi bility 
between the organisation and the society in which it operates. As responsible 
corporate citizens of the societies in which they do business, in addition to rights, 
organisations also have legal and moral obligations in respect on their economic, 
social and natural environments. As a responsible corporate citizen, the organisation 
should protect, enhance and invest in the wellbeing of the economy, society and the 
natural environment. Being a good corporate citizen goes beyond merely meeting 
financial obligations. In other words, it entails realising the financial obligations of 
the organisations and meeting the expectations of shareholders. Organisations are 
expected to perform and report on all the triple -bottom line issues - social, 
environmental  
364 CHAPTER 14: STRATEGIC CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT  
and economic. Furthermore, the report places responsibility for the ethical and 
effective governance of the organisation on the board of directors, and it explicitly 
states that ‘the board should ensure that the company is seen to be a responsible 
corporate citizen’.14 In order to achieve this, the board has two over -arching 
responsibilities. First, it is responsible for determining the strategic direction of the 
organisation and, cons equently, its ultimate performance. Second, it is responsible 
for the strategic control of the organisation.  
¦ Ethical leadership. An ethical leader is someone who not only does the right thing, 
but also does so in the right way and for the right reasons.15 This description of 
ethical leadership brings together two philosophies that dominate business ethics 
literature, namely, deontology and teleology. In accordance with the deontology 
perspective of business ethics, a leader should act out of a sense of duty  or adherence 
to the rules. These rules and duties should be rationally determined, and a leader 
should follow these rules because they are right, rather than because of the effects 
that they have. For example, a leader should follow the rules in terms of accounting, 
paying corporate taxes and value -added tax, labour laws, and so on. If a leader 
follows his or her duty, then he or she is deemed to have acted in an ethical manner, 
regardless of the outcomes. In line with the teleological (consequential) pers pective, 
a leader should be judged to be ethical if the outcomes of his or her actions have 
achieved something good, regardless of the actions themselves. These two 
descriptions (deontology and teleology) highlight two key elements in the thinking 
about et hical leadership, namely, the character of the leader (doing the things right) 
and the actions of the leader (doing the right things). Ethical leadership focuses on 
the moral character of the leader, his or her integrity and ethical awareness and his or 
her ability to communicate and extol this sense of ethics to the organisation. Ethical 
leadership is needed to direct and control an organisation in such a way that it 
promotes good corporate governance.  
¦ Sustainability. In Chapter 12, sustainability was defi ned as the ability of an 
organisation to continue to do business over the long term - and possibly indefinitely. 
We also indicated that sustainable business is tied up with the impact that the 
business has on the environmental resources of the world that i t consumes in the 
process. Sustainability suggests that business leaders need to critically consider how 
their organisations can reduce and minimise their impact on the natural resources 
they utilise. By doing this well, business leaders can help to ensure  that their 
businesses will be around in the future, and that future generations will continue to 
have the ability to support themselves and to flourish, thanks to the impact of current 
business strategies and practices. Therefore, the sustainability of or ganisations is 
connected to the long -term maintenance of their systems, taking into account 
environmental, economic and social considerations. Sustainability issues have gained 
importance internationally since the publication of King II. Locally, the topic  has 
also burgeoned. The JSE launched the SRI index in 2004 as a tool for investors to 
identify companies incorporating sustainability practices into their business  
365 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
activities. The proliferation of initiatives, tools and guidelines on sustainability is 
evidence of the growing awareness of sustainability issues. The significance of 
sustainable action by organisations is highlighted in the King Report as follows:  
Because the company is  so integral to society, it is considered as much a citizen 
of a country as is a natural person who has citizenship. It is expected that the 
company will be seen to be a responsible citizen. This involves social, 
environmental and economic issues - the tri ple context in which companies in 
fact operate. Boards should no longer make decisions based only on the needs of 
the present because this may compromise the ability of future generations to 
meet their own needs. ‘The success of companies in the 21st centu ry is bound up 
with three interdependent sub systems - the natural environment, the social and 
political system and the global economy. Global companies play a role in all 
three and they need all three to flourish.' This is according to Tomorrow's 
Company,  UK. 
In short, planet, people and profit are inextricably intertwined. A key challenge 
for leadership is to make sustainability issues mainstream. Strategy, risk, 
performance and sustainability have become inseparable; hence the phrase 
'integrated reportin g' which is used throughout this Report. The achievement of 
best practice in sustainability and integrated reporting is only possible if the 
leadership of a company embraces the notion of integrated sustainability 
performance and reporting .'6 
The big pictu re 
Strategies are long term and resource intensive, and can affect the fortunes of the whole 
organisation. For that reason, strategic control is important to ensure that the chosen 
strategies are still valid and that the implementation of the chosen strate gies is on track. 
Strategic control cannot be backward -looking, given the long -term focus of strategies. So 
it has to focus on being proactive and identifying strategic issues (those issues inside or 
outside the organisation that may be detrimental to the achievement of strategic 
objectives). In addition, strategic planning and implementation processes have to be 
integrated with organisational performance management systems to ensure that the work 
of every individual in the organisation is aligned with the strategy of the organisation. 
This is where tools like the balanced scorecard is particularly important. All organisations 
are exposed to risk and need to manage risk, and strategic risks, effectively. Corporate 
governance is an essential component of stra tegic risk management.  CHAPTER 14: STRATEGIC CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT  
Summary of learning outcomes  
LO 1: Define strategic control.  
Strategic control is a process used by organisations to control the formation and 
implementation of its strategies to ensure that it achieves the strategic goals that have 
been set for it.  
LO 2: Explain where strategic control fits into the strategic 
management process.  
Strategic control enables management to monitor strategic outcomes (or its corporate, 
overall performance) against planned or intended strategic goals to ensure that corporate 
activities remain on track and correspond to the set course without major discrepancies, 
while adapting to the changing environmental conditions.  
LO 3: Differentiate between the various types of strategic control.  
Four types of strategic control can be distinguished, namely, premise control, strategic 
surveillance, special alert control and implementation control.  
LO 4: Explain the balanced scorecard as a strategic con trol tool.  
The BSC enables management to monitor and evaluate organisational performance from 
four different perspectives in order to see whether strategic goals are being achieved in a 
balanced way. These four perspectives are the financial, internal busi ness, learning and 
growth, and customer perspectives. Within each perspective, managers can choose various 
measures. The BSC complements traditional financial indicators (such as return -on-
investment, sales growth and operating income) with measures of per formance for 
customers, internal processes, and innovation and improvement activities.  
LO 5: Explain risk, strategic risk and the strategic risk management process.  
Strategic risk is an uncertain future event or set of events which, should it occur, could 
have an effect (in both a negative and a positive manner) on the achievement of the 
strategic objectives of the organisation. A strategic risk is the combination of the 
probability of the future event (or set of events) and its consequence. Strategic risk 
management can be defined as the identification and evaluation of actual and potential 
risk areas as they pertain to an organisation as a total entity, followed by a process of 
either avoidance, termination, transfer, tolerance (acceptance), exploitation, or mitigation 
(treatment) of each risk, or a response that is a combination or integration of these. Three 
steps in the strategic risk management process can be distinguished, namely, risk 
identification, risk analysis and lastly, risk evaluation and respo nse. 
367 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
LO 6: Discuss corporate governance with specific reference to the three 
value dimensions thereof.  
Corporate governance can be defined as a framework of rules and practices by which a 
board of directors ensures accountability, fairness, and transparency in an organisation’s 
relationship with all its stakeholders. The corporate governance framework consists of (1) 
explicit and implicit contracts between the organisation and the stakeho lders for the 
distribution of responsibilities, rights, and rewards; (2) procedures for reconciling the 
sometimes conflicting interests of stakeholders in accordance with their duties, privileges, 
and roles; and (3) procedures for the proper supervision, c ontrol, and information -flows to 
serve as a system of checks - and-balances. The three value dimensions of corporate 
governance are corporate citizenship, ethical leadership and sustainability.

namely, finance, marketing, operations, human resources, procurement, research and 
development and public relations functions.  
Balanced scorecard: The balanced scorecard (BSC) is a strategic management tool 
developed by Kap lan and Norton to guide the organisation and management team to 
translate the strategic direction into a set of balanced strategic goals. It consists of 
four perspectives: financial, customer, learning and growth, and business processes.  
Best practice mode ls of planned change: There is a recipe that can be learned for 
managing change successfully.  
Business architecture (also known as organisational architecture): Business architecture 
can be defined as a blueprint of the organisation and all of its major co mponents 
(internal and external).  
Capabilities: The capacity of an organisation to deploy resources for a unique end result. 
The strategic value of capabilities is determined by its ability to generate revenue, its 
rarity, how difficult it is for competito rs to imitate or copy, and the extent to which the 
organisation is able to organise itself in order to exploit its capabilities.  
Competitive advantage: Organisations have competitive advantage when they achieve 
superior performance (in other words, perform ance consistently better than the market 
average) in the markets they compete in.  
Co-operative strategy: Co -operative strategies allow different organisations to form 
partnerships to share resources, capabilities or technical know -how to build a 
competitive advantage.  
371 PRACTISING STRATEGY: A SOUTHERN AFRICAN CONTEXT  
Core competencies (also known as distinctive capabilities): Those capabilities or 
competencies that distinguish an organisation from others in an industry and form  the 
basis of its competitive advantage.  
Corporate citizenship: This incorporates a concern for the social, environmental and 
economic performance of the organisation and a concern for the role, scope and 
purpose of the organisation.  
Corporate governance: A framework of rules and practices by which a board of directors 
ensures accountability, fairness, and transparency in an organisation's relationship with 
all its stakeholders.  
Corporate governance framework: A framework that consists of (1) explicit and i mplicit 
contracts between the organisation and the stakeholders for distribution of 
responsibilities, rights, and rewards; (2) procedures for reconciling the sometimes 
conflicting interests of stakeholders in accordance with their duties, privileges, and 
roles; and (3) procedures for proper supervision, control, and information -flows to 
serve as a system of checks -and-balances.  
Cost leadership strategy: A cost leadership strategy involves becoming the lowest cost 
organisation (with regard to production cost ) in a domain of activity by a significant 
margin.  
Cultural web: The cultural web shows the behavioural, physical and symbolic 
manifestations of a culture that inform and are informed by taken -for-granted 
assumptions, or paradigm, of an organisation.  
Deliberate strategy: Deliberate strategies are strategies that mostly originate from a 
central direction and organisational hierarchy in a formal setting.  
Differentiation strategy: A differentiation strategy involves uniqueness along some 
dimension that is  sufficiently valued by customers to allow a price premium.  
Divisional structure: The structuring of an organisation according to individual products, 
services, products groups, major projects or profit centres.  
Dominant general management logic: A set of broad (often flawed) assumptions that 
managers have about how their business works.  
Dynamic capabilities: Those capabilities that help organisations to learn the capabilities 
they require to adapt to environmental changes.  
Dynamic consistency: The extent t o which the strategies of the organisation match with its 
(internal) resources and capabilities.  
Economic environment: A sub -environment of the remote environment comprising the 
variables from which economic factors, conditions or trends such as economic c limate, 
economic growth, inflation rates, interest rates, exchange rates and unemployment 
rates originate.  
Effectiveness: Effectiveness means doing the right things.  
Efficiency: Efficiency means doing things right.
