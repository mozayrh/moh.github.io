They are acknowledged as engines driving economic growth, competitiveness and job creation. <br>Often, emerging economies are fuelled by a search  for growth opportunities, which leads to experimenting <br>with new busi ness models while building on and extending traditional approaches to strategy and <br>management.  <br>Critical issues such as conducting a feasibility analysis to test a business idea are discus sed. Success factors <br>and challenges linked to small business start -ups in emerging economies are also touched on.  <br>The book aims to provide a balanced theory and practical approach to help budding entrepreneurs develop <br>successful businesses. Fundamental asp ects such as innovation and creativity, as well as entrepreneurial <br>strategies are discussed. There is a focus on enterprise functions in order to ensure that there is an <br>understanding of what small -business owners should do in their respective endeavours.  <br>The analysis of the BRICS member countries adds value for the reader as it provides background to various <br>entrepreneurial environments. The book touches on current issues such as high rates of unemployment and <br>how to tackle poverty in emerging economies. B usinesses of all sizes are required to operate within certain <br>paramet ers. The importance of ethics, governance, sustainability and social entrepreneurship are explored. <br>The case studies included in the book allow for reflection, and encourage the reader to  explore the intricacies <br>of entrepreneurship in emerging economies in  the 21st century.  <br>STRUCTURE OF THE BOOK  <br>This book is divided into four sections.  <br>Section A: The entrepreneurial ideas and contextual nature of entrepreneurship  <br>This section covers  chapter 1 –10, and provides the reader with information pertaining to entrepreneurship in <br>developing economies. There is a focus on areas such as entrepreneurial skills, creativity and innovati on, as <br>well as feasibility analysis.  <br>Section B: Enterprise functions  <br>This section covers  chap ters 11–16, and gives a perspective on enterprise functions, such as human resource <br>managem ent, finance, and marketing and sales, for example, with a view to pr oviding guiding principles in <br>terms of performing them.  <br>Section C: Types of business focus  <br>This section covers  chapter 17 –21 and deals with types of businesses such as family businesse s, franchising, <br>corporate and social entrepreneurship.  <br>Section D: Plans and cases studies  <br>This is the concluding section of the book, which essentially covers the essence of the business plan as well <br>as relevant case studies.

They are acknowled ged as engines of ec onomic growth, competitiveness and job <br>creation (Wennekers, 2004). The 21st century is, however, the century of the emerging economi es, both in <br>market growth and in changes to business strategy. The 2010 gross domestic product (GDP) sta tistics <br>published by  both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank indicate that the traditional <br>BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India a nd China) are now counted among the largest economies in the world <br>respectively. While the newest member  of the BRICS, South  Africa, is among the top 30 economies in the <br>world (PwC, 2015), it is further predicted that by 2050 the economies of Brazil, Russi a, India, China and <br>South Africa will be accelerating more greatly than that of the G6 (the US, Japan, t he UK, Germany, Fran ce <br>and Italy (Wilson & Purushothaman, 2002)). The BRICS countries are important drivers of economic growth <br>and that is why they are considered as efficiency -driven economies.  <br>The prosperity of a country refers to the overall  development  of the total number  of production units that <br>prevail in that economy. An emerging economy or emerging market is a specific type of economy that is <br>entrepreneurial at its core. Thus Schumpeter (1912) emphasised the role of entrepreneurs as a prime cause of  <br>economic developmen t. Van Praag and Versloot (1934: 352) assert that entrepreneurs have a very specific <br>function in the economy. In their view, entrepr eneurs create employment and productivity growth, and <br>produce commercialised high -quality innovations. S mall businesses cont ribute not only to employment but 24 <br> are also a barometer for social and political stability as they offer innovation and competitive p ower to matters <br>of policy makers, job creation, economic growth and international competitiveness in glo bal markets (Carree,  <br>Van Stel, Thurik et al., 2002).  <br>The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) of 2013 indicates that growth expectations and aspiration s of <br>early -stage entrepreneurs are key factors in determining the entrepreneurial impact and also policy  objectives <br>that wil l help create more jobs. It is further established that the entrepreneurial activity rate (TEA) per country <br>is based on innovation -, orientation - and factor -driven scales, as discussed below.  <br>It is indicated in the 2013 GEM report that countries such as Ja pan, Korea and China showed a high degree of <br>innovative orientation and a high level of economic development as seen through their i nnovative products <br>and services. These countries were closely followed by entrepreneurs in North America  and the European <br>Union (EU).  <br>With the exception of South Africa, the sub -Saharan economies and European economies outside the EU <br>reported lower proport ions, while emerging nations such as Colombia, Chile, Taiwan and South Africa offered <br>products or servic es that are new to t heir customers and experienced few local competitors.  <br>Efficiency -driven economies (economies that focus on improving production effi ciencies to drive growth) <br>include Russia, Brazil, India, China and South Africa, as well as the BRICS co untries mentioned pr eviously. <br>Factor -driven economies, where countries compete primarily on the use of unskilled labour and natural <br>resources, revealed the lowest level of international customers on average. Often companies in these <br>economies compete on th e basis of price as they buy and sell basic products or commodities. Schwab (2012) <br>categorises countries such as Iran, Egypt, Angola and Pakistan as fac tor-driven.  <br>1.2 THE DEFINITION OF EMERGING ECONOMIES  <br>Scholars give many different interpretations of the  concept of emerging  economies. Child, Faulkner and <br>Tallman (2011) define emerging economies as complex environments in which traditional and modern <br>institutions are embedded, often seen in a combination of bureaucratic and market -based economies. PwC <br>(2015) see emerging econ omies as those searching for growth opportunities and experimenting with new <br>business models even as they build on and extend tradit ional approaches to strategy and management.  <br>It is important to note that all the countries referred to as emerging economie s are located in the “Global <br>South” known as Asia and the Pacific and they were at some stage colonised by some Western powers. Thei r <br>strengths vary from very strong, for example China and India, to very weak, such as Sudan and Bolivia.  These <br>issues are be tter understood politically since these countries are seen as having been underdeveloped by <br>colonialism: colonial powers used them a s sources of raw materials and markets for finished products. There <br>was never an attempt to develop them  as independent econ omies but they are therefore “emerging” as they <br>struggle to catch up to the Western world, in a sense, “emerging” from the shadows o f colonial domination.  <br>Urbonavicius (2015) defines emerging economies as the transitional economies of C entral and Eastern E urope, Asian nations <br>(China, India, Vietnam and others) that are increasing their free -market systems; countries in Central and Sout h America; and <br>finally, countries in Africa. Each of these regions face unique challenges. Emerging econ omies are those econ omies in search <br>of growth opportunities and offer new products and services to their customers locally or internationally. Such econ omies are <br>marked by unique challenges of culture, values and infrastructure limitations. They may experi ence challenges with  the <br>acceptance of new, nontraditional business models. (See  Figure 1.2 .) <br>As menti oned, these countries are emerging from the shadows of their colonial pasts. At some stage their <br>economies served only the interests of the Western colonial powers with little regard for local development. <br>Consequently, the concept of a n emerging e conomy i s a reflection of historical economic –political factors. <br>Colonies were sources of primary raw materials as well as markets for the products finished by European 25 <br> colonial powers. All infrastructural improvements were effected in colonies  for the sol e purpos e of taking <br>goods to the harbours and out of the colonies. The minimal education offered was also meant to ensure a <br>labour force literate enough to execute colonial instructions rather than provide sustainable skills. <br>“Emergence” then m eans success fully co ming out of these conditions.  <br>The term “emerging economy” represents those newly industrialising economies or countries (NICs) which <br>today include the BRICS and their showing in international forums such as the World Trade Organization <br>(WTO) (Piete rse, 200 9: 1–3; Palat, 2009: 39 –60). Nowadays it is loosely applied to all the global South. These <br>countries have also been called the “developing world” or “developing economies”. It is also important to <br>understand that the evolution of the te rm has been informed  by both economic and political narratives. <br>However, the choice of the term “emerging economies” shows clear concentration on the economic front <br>rather than the political one. This emergence is reflected in the postulated view that Chin a and India in <br>particular stand to overtake the leading Western economies in terms of GDP in the near future. Thus it is <br>necessary to understand the characteristics of emerging economies. In the definitions below, Pieterse (2009: <br>15–28) simplifies the char acteristics of emerg ing economies as follows:  <br>• Trade:  there is a growing trend to redefine the geographies of trade among developing countries as they <br>prefer to trade among themselves.  <br>• Finance:  the hegemonic role of money lenders (the IMF and the World Bank , both of wh ich are dominated <br>by Western leadership) is declining as developing countries choose to finance their own economies along <br>East Asian –Latin and American –African lines ( hegemony  refers to the dominance of one state or body <br>over another).  <br>• Institut ions:  the po licies o f the IMF, World Bank and the WTO have resulted in large debt burdens and <br>prescriptive policies for countries in the South.  <br>• Hegemony:  the Global South has distanced itself from the West and is pursuing South -friendly policies in <br>respons e to, for ex ample, t he primarily Western Group of Seven (an informal bloc consisting of Canada, <br>France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US).  <br>• Growing inequality:  there is clear growth of inequality in developing countries as compared to developed <br>ones , as seen in  shrinki ng agricultural produce, the often -negative role of multinational companies and <br>rising slums.  <br>1.3 SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP: THE SOUTH <br>AFRICAN PERSPECTIVE  <br>Entrepreneurship is the dynamic process of creating increme ntal wealth.  It invo lves vision, change and <br>creation. It requires an application of energy and passion towards the creation and implementation of new <br>ideas and creative solutions.  <br>The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (2015) showed that small businesses crea ted more than 50 per cent of <br>all employment opportunities in South Africa, while contributing more than 45 percent of the country’s gross <br>domestic product (GDP). According to Zulu ( Brand South Africa, 2015), South Africa’s high rate of <br>unemployment, poverty  and extreme inequal ity called for bold and far -sighted interventions aimed at ensuring <br>that small enterprises grow into thriving businesses. Government initiatives are also geared  towards providing <br>financial and non -financial support to small businesses i n order to reduce ob stacles of doing business. Given <br>this high unemployment rate, Kingdon and Knight (2004: 392) argue that one would expect a large informal <br>sector to absorb this surplus labour, but South Africa has a relatively small informal sector. The re are a number <br>of possible explanations for this phenomenon (Banerjee, Galian, Levinsohn, McLaren & Woolard, 2008; <br>Rodrik, 2008). The South African government has implemented vari ous strategies to encourage entrepreneurs <br>and small businesses without much success (Herrington,  Kew & Kew, 2009; Urban, 2010). South Africa <br>performs very poorly in international entrepreneurship surveys and has consistently been ranked near or at the <br>bottom of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) (Amoros & Bosma, 2014). Furt hermore, Herrington 26 <br> (2013) affirms that South Africa’s rate for new -business and early -stage entrepreneurs is still significantly <br>lower than for other sub -Saharan countries. He ind icates that a worrying trend is the low number of established <br>small business es in the country. T he established business rate in sub -Saharan Africa is high at 13 per cent, but <br>South Africa comes in well below the norm at 2.9 per cent.  <br>Undoing the legacy of apartheid necessitates bringing more South Africans into the mainstream econ omy, but <br>the large c orporate sector cannot absorb all the surplus labour. This means that entrepreneurial activity must <br>be an important cornerstone of any economic strategy. Noneth eless the South African Banking Association <br>Annual Review (2016), indicates that small -and-mediu m enterprises (SMEs) have been identified as <br>productive drivers of inclusive economic growth and development in South Africa and around the world. In <br>South Afri ca, SMEs make up 91 per cent of formalised businesses, and provide employmen t to about 60 per <br>cent of the labour force, while total economic output accounts for roughly 34 per cent of GDP. SMEs <br>contribute significantly to the economy, by fostering diversif ication through their development of new and <br>unsaturated sectors of the econ omy. In addition, in novative and technology -based small -and-medium <br>enterprises can provide a platform for local, regional and international growth, especially in the BRICS <br>economie s. <br>1.4 CHALLENGES FACING SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES IN SOUTH AFRICA  <br>Altman  (2013: 205 –206) and  Juma (2015: 68 –69) identified some of the challenges that South African SMEs <br>face, namely  <br>• lack of access to capital  <br>• lack of skills training  <br>• crime  <br>• capital -intensive structure of the formal economy that makes it difficult for the small b usiness to find its own <br>niche  <br>• the regulatory environment, which makes it difficult for the small business to be sustainable  <br>• high unemploy ment levels that may have a bearing on the demand for goods  <br>• reliance on exporting primary raw materials  <br>• lack of underst anding of market nee ds <br>• lack of support for research and development.  <br>Piracy and illicit trade could also be added to this list. South Afr ica has become very exposed to global <br>economic challenges to which it was less vulnerable pre -1994. Opening the economy  comes with its own <br>challenges. Piracy, especially in the arts industry, destroys emerging artists and this means they cannot live <br>sustai nable lives. The SAB (2013: 63) further shows that mentoring is lacking within the small -business sector. <br>Linking emerg ing businesses to la rge experienced partners could help ensure better skills transfer and <br>technological innovation. This initiative has t he following advantages for SMEs:  <br>• Prevention of corruption and assistance with measures to prevent crime  <br>• Provision of a ppropriate technolog y <br>• Improved production capacity (includes access to electricity)  <br>• Improved management skills  <br>• A supply of a skilled labo ur force  <br>• Access to finance and ability to obtain credit  <br>• Access to markets and developing relationships with customers  <br>• Recognition by large companies and government bureaucracy  <br>• Transfer of knowledge from large, experienced partners to SMEs  <br>• Provision of supp ort and assistance with regulatory compliance  27 <br> 1.4.1 The informal sector and local economic development  <br>According to the  Quarterly Labour Fo rce Survey  (2012), 2.1 million people in South Africa are active in the <br>informal economy and the sector contributes 2 8 per cent of South Africa’s GDP (Salga Network, 2012). The <br>informal sector plays a crucial role in job creation and po verty alleviation. I n South Africa, the informal <br>economy forms a key component of strategies to address unemployment and poverty and supp ort the creation <br>of sustainable livelihoods. National policies on Local Economic Development (LED) or on small and medi um-<br>sized enterprise development  set important frameworks and guidelines for all actors involved in this field. <br>Public funding and support  structures at national, provincial or local level also set powerful incentives.  <br>Government has a particular role to pl ay in LED by ensurin g that it leads to job creation, sustainable rural <br>development and urban renewal. LED interventions are meant to bene fit disadvantaged and marginalised <br>people and communities within municipal boundaries through an inclusive and redistri butive approach to <br>economic development.  <br>Figure 1.1 South African local economic development network  <br> <br>Source:  Adapted from  http://www.SAnews.gov.za  (2015)  <br> <br>Figure 1.1  provides the networks and functions of the LED while addressing job creation. It highlights the <br>different networks an d their responsibil ities.  <br>1.4.1.1 Main functions of local economic development and related issues  <br>• Local government is responsible for creating a favourable environment for business development and <br>success. By its nature, local economic development is a par tnership between th e business sector, <br>community interests and municipal government.  <br>• Government agencies such as the Sector Education Training Authorities (SETAs) and SEDA (Small Enterprise <br>Development Agency) all have a potential role to play in supporting  LED initiatives.  <br>28 <br> • Foreign donor organis ations have a specific focus on LED issues; the most important of which in this country <br>is Germany, whose main focal sectors are local government and good governance. The EU has also played <br>a significant role in provi nces such as Kwa -Zulu-Natal, the Easter n Cape and Limpopo.  <br>• There are currently more than 30 local economic development agencies (LEDAs), across South Africa, <br>operating at the district and local municipality level. However, they have had very different leve ls of <br>success. Ther e is not always agre ement among the various LEDA role players as to exactly how these <br>agencies should operate and how their mandate should differ from, and be integrated with, the local <br>economic development responsibilities of the local authority. Although  government initiati ves are stimuli <br>for creating a sustainable environment for business and job creation, it is necessary that challenges facing <br>the South African government be outlined and their role defined, especially with regard to e ducation.  <br>1.4.2 The  role of entrepreneu rial education  <br>Entrepreneurship is one of the means to alleviate poverty in emerging economies and transitional countries by <br>increasing the number of entrepreneurs and creating employment and innovation in individuals . In South <br>Africa, the following should  be addressed in order to achieve national goals in stimulating entrepreneurship <br>and small business in education.  <br>1.4.2.1 Technical and vocational education and training (TVET) colleges  <br>• Business must work with governm ent to adapt the sc hool curriculum, in particular the curricula of technical <br>and vocational education and training (TVET) courses, so that young people leave school ready for work.  <br>• Training programmes must be tailored to demand. If this does not happen, go vernment will be sp ending <br>money in vain . <br>• Rewrite the syllabi of TVET colleges to meet the industry’s needs thereby fostering an enabling environment <br>that will result in an increase in the percentage of graduates who find jobs.  <br>• Financial incentives should b e provided to SMEs,  as well as to big businesses that promote student <br>internships.  <br>1.4.2.2 Universities  <br>• Universities should play a critical role in redesigning the curricula to meet the needs of student <br>entrepreneurs through th eoretical and practical initi atives for skills d evelopment.  <br>• Promote an entrepreneurship ecosystem that stimulates entrepreneurship through the intervention of <br>curricula design. Mapping the entrepreneurial landscape by collectively addressing the triple cha llenges of <br>poverty, unemploym ent and inequality by looking into the role of entrepreneurship education.  <br>• An education system should equip the youth with the necessary tools to reduce high dropout rates, which <br>severely undermines skills building and employab ility.  <br>• Education systems shou ld unleash the pote ntial of student entrepreneurs; this will significantly alleviate <br>poverty and unemployment and give students the skills to create employment.  <br>• Develop the interdisciplinary skills that lead to the development of an “entrepreneurial mindse t” as a result <br>of access to facilities such as: ideation centres, entrepreneurship incubators, mentors, support and <br>funding.  <br>• Meaningful learning happens through engagement with students since everyone has things to learn. The <br>curriculum becomes nothing mor e than words on a p age if students do not have the opportunity to <br>actually engage with it. Hands -on experiential training is beneficial.  29 <br> 1.5 ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND AFRICAN INTEGRATION  <br>1.5.1 Entrepreneurs and Ubuntu values  <br>One of the characteristics of Ubuntu  is caring. Entrepr eneurs should be encouraged to have a sound <br>understanding of their impact on others and acknowledge others’ interests as being valid and as significant as <br>their own. Embracing this particular value wou ld dramatically change the way they do business. Allis’ s (2012) <br>start-up guide for entrepreneurship and small business shows how to conduct business using the values of <br>Ubuntu.  <br>Allis (2012) identified the following characteristics of Ubuntu in the indigeno us knowledge production <br>paradigm:  <br>• Acceptance:  recognise  the unique humanity of those with whom one does business; the stakeholders.  <br>• Action:  understand that deliberate and careful actions can be agents of change.  <br>• Adaptation:  maintain the ability to flow, le arn and modify yourself to fit new s urroundings or adap t to new <br>circumstances.  <br>• Analysis:  analyse what you do and do not do, and attempt to define and derive inherent laws, axioms, tenets <br>and guideposts based on the effects of these actions and inactions.  <br>• Best effort:  put forth full and best effort within the b oundaries of proper physical and m ental health.  <br>• Challenge:  regularly challenge and step outside your comfort zone to reach worthy goals.  <br>• Commitment:  uphold commitments and always underpromise and overdeliver.  <br>• Communication:  make it a pri ority to learn and communicate extremely well with ot hers.  <br>• Confidence:  always be confident and optimistic, and set realistic but ambitious goals.  <br>• Honesty:  be honest and forthright in all representations and deliberations with yourself and others.  <br>• Integrity : act with integrit y and in alignment with what you s ay you will do.  <br>• Perseverance:  do not give up nor give in too soon, as long as a goal is worthy of the effort  <br>• Work ethic:  work both hard and intelligently and do not leave for tomorrow what can be done to day. <br>The practical application of Ubuntu values in em erging African economies contributes to new business <br>methodologies and profit making, which is one of the main objectives of a business.  <br>1.6 THE SOUTH AFRICAN POSITION WITHIN BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA, CHINA , SOUTH <br>AFRICA (BRI CS) <br>The BRICS countries are said to have a lot in common in terms of population, GDP and unemployment. The <br>invitation of South Africa’s participation into BRICS is to provide a gateway to Africa. According to DIRCO <br>SA (2014), the formati on of BRICS is an e ffort by its members to foster co operation in order to meet global <br>challenges, especially those faced by emerging economies. There are arguments regarding why South Africa <br>should be included in BRICS and opposing arguments regarding why South Africa should  not be included. <br>These arguments  are summarised below.  <br>1.6.1 Arguments for South Africa’s inclusion in BRICS  <br>According to Naidoo (2012), the reasons that South Africa should be included in BRICS are:  <br>• South Africa accounts for approximat ely one -third of do mestic product in sub -Saharan Afr ica. <br>• It is seen as able to provide BRICS members with improved access to Africa’s 800 million consumers.  <br>• It has minerals and other resources that cannot be ignored with regard to accelerating new growth.  <br>• South Africa has a mature economy and sound corporate governance structures.  <br>• It has a strong regulatory framework, which can attract investors seeking a secu re investment.  30 <br> • South Africa is also the platform, through the JSE, on which investment throughout t he continent is <br>established.  <br>• Many South African companies do business in Africa and are also therefore well placed to provide <br>information to BRICS nations lo oking to invest in Africa.  <br>• South Africa has an excellent infrastructure, established corporate foot prints and a cultur e of innovation.  <br>• It has easy access to finance for business, a stable macro - and micro financial climate.  <br>• There is an advanced banking sys tem and functioning regulatory frameworks.  <br>• According to DIRCO SA (2014), South Africa is also the m ost developed count ry in sub -Saharan Africa and <br>serves as a gateway to Africa.  <br>1.6.2 Arguments against South Africa’s inclusion in BRICS  <br>The following repres ents the argument by Neill (2010) against South Africa participating in BRICS despite it <br>being a ga teway to Africa.  <br>• South Africa is by far the smallest in economic output. South Africa has therefore too small an economy to <br>justify its inclusion in the grou p. <br>• It has an economy of $286 billion, less than a quarter of Russia’s, the smallest of the original  four BRIC <br>nations,  and its population of 50 million is far below Russia’s 142 million and Brazil’s 191 million.  <br>• Many commentators have indicated that Nigeri a would have better represented the African continent since <br>it is thought to have an economy larger  than that of South  Africa as well as the largest population on the <br>continent.  <br>• South Africa is far too small to be in the top 20 global economies, and is not  even a member of the N11 (the <br>“Next 11” emerging economies with promising outlooks).  <br>• Even on the A frican continent, S outh Africa’s growth prospects are anticipated to be only 2.7 per cent in <br>2016 to 2017, while the average for the rest of Africa, in the s hort -tomedium term, is expected to be 7 per <br>cent.  <br>South Africa is also losing out in terms of forei gn investment to Ni geria, a country with a population of 155 <br>million (Naidoo, 2012). However, arguments for the inclusion of South Africa in BRICS indicate t hat what <br>South Africa lacks in demographic and economic clout, it is said to make up by representin g Africa at BRICS.  <br>Table 1.1  indicates the geographic position of BRICS nation s. It shows that Ru ssia is the biggest country, at <br>17.1 million square kilometres (km2). Due to its large area, it also has more administrative regions than all the <br>other BRICS members. The second largest country is China at 9.5 million km2, followed by Br azil (8.5 million <br>km2) then India (3.3 million km2). South Africa has the smallest area at 1.2 million km2 and the smallest <br>number of administrative regions.  According to the South African Institute of International Affairs (SAIIA), <br>the BRICS countries col lectively account f or over a quarter of the world’s land area (CIA, 2013).  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 31 <br> Figure 1.2 Levels of entrepreneurial activity (TEA) categorised by motivating fact or and BRICS <br>country  <br> <br>Note: Necessity -based TEA indicates entrepreneurial activity that is prompte d by the e ntrepreneur being unable to find work <br>elsewhere, and therefore needing to start a business to support him or herself. Opportunity -driven TEA indicates <br>entrepreneurship th at is driven by the availability of business opportunities. Improvement -driven TEA ind icates <br>entrepreneurial activity that arises when an entrepreneur is not driven by need to embark on a new business venture, but is <br>driven by the potential of increasing h is or her income, or by the benefit of being independent.  <br>Source:  GEM Global  Report (2 014) <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>32 <br> Table 1.1 Geographical position of BRICS  <br> <br>Source:  Central Intelligence Agency (CIA ) (2013)  <br>1.6.3 Economic power and what it means  <br>According to Goldman (2003), it is expected that by 2050, the four BRIC economies could be wealthier than <br>most of the current major economic powers. China and India will become the world’s dominant suppliers of <br>manufactured goods and services, respectively,  while Brazil and Russia will become similarly dominant as <br>suppliers of raw materials.

BRIC m ember <br>countries, sometimes known as the “Big Four” are referred to as emerging economies. Although the per capita <br>income levels remain lower than industrialised economie s, the aggregate wealth of the BRIC co untries will <br>exceed that of the G6 partly due to the large populations of these countries. South Africa (now a BRICS <br>member) is not doing well in relation to high unemployment and low growth. Unstable political climate s, <br>skills shortages due to its poor ed ucation system resulting from past policies, and corruption as well as crime, <br>all compromise growth potential for South Africa. Nevertheless South Africa is very well positioned for high <br>export trading and a hub or gat eway for African countries is an added  advantage to BRICS.  <br>1.6.4 Opportunities and chal lenges of emerging economies – the BRICS perspective  <br>Table 1.2 Disadvantages and advantages of different BRICS countries for entrepreneurs (see <br>also section 4.3 ) <br>Opportunities: Brazil  <br>• Rich in natural resources (minerals, oil and gas, <br>soybeans, ra inforest, water)  <br>• Diversified economy  <br>• Favourable labour costs  Challenges: Brazil  <br>• Social infrastructure lacki ng (e.g. road and rail <br>transport systems)  <br>• High tax burden on individuals and corporates (the <br>highest in emerging economies)  <br>• Low levels of investment in education and ski lls <br>development  <br>• High levels of inflation and public debt  <br>Opportunities: Russia  <br>• Rich in  natural resources  <br>• A leading economy  <br>• Has the largest consumer class  <br>• Relatively politically stable  <br>• Has a skilled labour force  Challenges: Russia  <br>• Hit hard by 2008’s financ ial crisis  <br>• High levels of inflation in comparison to other <br>emerging economies  <br>• Low level s of investment in social infrastructure  <br>• Low levels of investment in business resulting in <br>busines ses not always being competitive  <br>• Lacks institutional strength and polit ical willingness to <br>implement serious reforms that help to sustain <br>growth  <br>Opportunitie s: India  <br>• Growing young population gives a competitive <br>edge and drives economic growth  <br>• Private companies in key sectors (IT, <br>outsourcing, pharmaceuticals and textiles) <br>are a key asset  Challenges: India  <br>• Public sector finance is poor  <br>• High levels of debt  <br>• Low s pending on development  <br>• Poor infrastructure, low levels of internet penetration <br>and bur densome bureaucracy  <br>• Risk-averse environment  <br>Opportunities: China  <br>• Industrially comp etitive and diverse  <br>• High levels of economic growth (although <br>slowing)  <br>• Strong foreign in vestment  <br>• Strong levels of development with regard to <br>infrastructure and technology  Challenges: China  <br>• Environmental issues pose a threat to sustainable <br>growth  <br>• High levels  of inequality lead to social tensions  <br>• Factory employment is close to maximum capacity  <br>• The supply of cheap labour is shrinking, as urban <br>wages rise and more people leave rur al areas for <br>urban areas  <br>Opportunities: South Africa  <br>• Gateway to Africa  Challenges: South Africa  34 <br> • Good natura l resources  <br>• Relatively stable politically, mature economy <br>and sound corporate governanc e structures  <br>• Good infrastructure  <br>• Business finance available  <br>• An advanced banking system  <br>• Expanding consumer market  <br>• Youthful demography  • Skills shor tages due to  a poor education system <br>inherited from the previous dispensation  <br>• High leve ls of unemployment, poverty and inequality  <br>• Corruption and crime  <br>• Economically small in comparison to the other BRIC <br>countries  <br>• High levels of bureaucracy and regulatory <br>compliance  <br>• Natural challenges, such as drought and the spread <br>of HIV/AIDS  <br>Source:  Adapte d from  Greater Lansing Business Monthly  (2009)  <br>1.6.5 Regional imperatives  <br>Table  1.3 shows both the benefits and barriers to regional co -operation. The Southern African Development <br>Community (SADC) demonstrates that regional cooperation holds good prospects for participants.  <br>Table 1.3 Benefits and barriers to regional cooperation in the S ADC  <br>Benefits  Barriers  <br>Integration of air services  Poor connectivity and high fares  <br>Harmonised regulations and legislation  Fear of losing own sovereignty  <br>Gender e quality and empowerment  Negative traditional views of subordinating women  <br>Improved pos tal services  Labour disputes  <br>Improved telecommunications  Theft of copper cables  <br>Trade liberalisation  Dumping of cheap, poor -quality goods  <br>Labour mobility  Trafficking  <br>Loosening border controls  Threats to sovereignty  <br>Improved tourism market  Environmenta l degradation  <br>Population provides market  Unemployment and poverty make trade difficult  <br>Cultural diversity  Trade marginalises local cultures  <br>Technological transfers  Patent/intellectual property rights  <br>Source:  SADC (2012)  <br> <br> 35 <br> Table 1.3  provides a su mmary of benefits and barriers that countries of the SA DC experience. These issues <br>are not unique to this region. Trade among countries brings with it both positives and negatives, but with <br>cooperation these negatives can be successfully addressed. Similar ly, small businesses can benefit in the same <br>way.  <br>Free trade means businesses can eng age with little or no fear of the burden of taxation. Also, free trade means <br>traders are relieved from the states subsidising their country’s products unfairly. One of the  reasons the BRICS <br>was formed, for example, relates to unhappiness with the manner in  which the rich countries dominate the <br>emerging economies. This means that if the emerging economies adopt policies that favour them outside the <br>confines of the rich world , they stand more chance of doing business with each ot her without domination. In <br>this regard, regional trade tends to equate countries of similar strengths and ideologies to some extent.  <br>Explaining Asia’s regional economic integration, Das (2009) highligh ts the following as advantages of <br>regional integration:  <br>• Coherent policy mechanisms ad dress developmental asymmetries.  <br>• Helps less developed countries take advantage of global market -access opportunities.  <br>• Enhances social cohesion.  <br>• Improves social infrastruct ure including health and education.  <br>• Reduces absolute pr otectionism.  <br>• Member countries benefit from lower prices.  <br>• Development experiences get replicated.  <br>• Trade barriers are removed.  <br>• Labour movement is encouraged.  <br>1.7 POLICY IMPLICATIONS FOR ENTREPRENEURIAL D EVELOPMENT WITHIN SOUTH <br>AFRICA  <br>• South Africa has a 25 per cent unemployment rate relat ed to structural unemployment. Policy makers, <br>government and other stakeholders need to create an enabling environment for lea rning. TVET colleges <br>should be prioritised to  assist the youth with technical vocational skills, while universities should create a <br>conducive entrepreneurship ecosystem to stimulate practical learning.  <br>• Financial resources could be mainstreamed to big busin ess, which will then be used for internships.  This will <br>result in skills transfer to prospective entrepreneurs.  <br>• The contribution o f the informal sector, for instance street vending, should be recognised as this sector <br>creates employment opportunities.  <br>• Meas ures to improve access to poorly located area s due to inadequate infrastructure (in the rural areas), <br>which limits social inclusio n and faster economic growth, should be put in place.  <br>• South Africa’s growth path is highly resource intensive and hence unsust ainable. This can be changed by <br>better educat ion and training as discussed above.  <br>• Corruption, which undermines state legitimacy an d service delivery, should be kept in check.  <br>1.8 CONCLUSION  <br>In this chapter the concept of an emerging economy was outlined in  the context of BRICS. Emerging <br>economies are  those economies that offer new products and services to their customers locally and <br>internationally and as such provide growth opportunities for entrepreneurs. Challenges that are sometimes <br>faced by entrepreneu rs in small business are sometimes caused by the challenges of territorial borders and 36 <br> infrastructure. Nonetheless, in some circum stances many emerging economies are coming out from the <br>shadows of their past colonial masters. Consequently, the concept is a  reflection of historical economic -<br>political factors.  <br>REVIEW QUESTIONS  <br>1. Define the concept “emerging economies”.  <br>2.

The enhanced <br>spending power of the growing middle class in these emerging economies is responsible for the creatio n of <br>small business. Abor and Quartey (2010) suggest that , according to statistics, more than  80 per cent of all <br>businesses in South Africa are described as small and this large number of small businesses is responsible for <br>about 40 per cent of all economi c activity. Natarajan and Wyrick (2011) suggest that it i s important to know <br>that about 80 pe r cent of all new job opportunities are created in the small -business sector and that more than <br>70 per cent of South Africans are employed in small businesses. Sma ll businesses therefore form the backbone <br>of the South Af rican emerging economy.  <br>The term “em erging economy” appeared in the 90s. It is an updated term for Third World countries. It is <br>difficult to define and it is easier to remark that emerging economies include “all those countries not <br>considered developed”. E merging economies have some characte ristics of developed economies, but do not <br>meet standards to be considered developed economies yet. The characteristics of developed economies can be <br>described: as  high average income per capita and education level; with  a relatively small population growt h <br>rate per year; and offering a lifestyle market economy to its population. It is clear that these characteristics do <br>not depict a developing country like South Af rica. <br>In contrast, South Africa has an emerging (developi ng) economy, which suffers from: a g enerally low level <br>of income per capita of the population; high unemployment levels; a large informal sector; a large small -<br>business sector; and exports raw materi als instead of processed products to developed countries,  such as <br>France. Another example of a developed economy is the Netherlands, which has a successful economy and <br>well-established capital markets. It also shows openness to foreign ownership, ease of c apital movement and <br>efficiency of market  institutions. In  contrast to the Netherlands South A frica is known as an emerging <br>economy and experiences lower income per capital, rising interest rates, an unstable sociopolitical <br>environment, high unemployment an d lower levels of business activity (Abor & Quartey, 2010 ). Emerging <br>economies can be found t hroughout Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe whereas mature economies are those in 40 <br> North America, western Europe and Japan. In addition to being an emerging economy, South Africa also <br>joined the BRIC countries in 2010.  <br>Even  though it has a much smaller popula tion and economy as compared to the other BRICS countries, factors <br>such as its vast natural resources (gold, diamonds and platinum), developed infrastructure, easy  access to <br>finance for small businesses and functioning r egulatory frameworks work in its fav our to be included <br>(http://www.fairobserver.com ). It is evident that China is the most dominant constituen t of the BRICS, and it <br>is also a top investor in South Af rican banking, infrastructure, minin g, transport and renewable energy. For <br>example, Standard Bank received an investment of $4.7bn from the Industrial Commercial Bank of China <br>(ICBC), which represent s a 20 per cent share. It seems that emerging economies c ontribute to the world <br>economy by be coming important areas for global manufacturing operations. In developed countries, <br>employment is very expensive; that is how emerging economies manufacture produc ts that will be more <br>competitively priced.  <br>In emerging ec onomies products are manufactured by  small businesses. Therefore a significant characteristic <br>of a flourishing and growing emerging economy is a booming small -business sector (Fida, 2008). The <br>signif icant role that this sector plays in the South African ec onomy cannot be ignored. Van Scheers  (2011) <br>argues that, although there is recognition of the important role they play in the South African economy, their <br>development, growth and sustainability are l argely constrained by a number of factors. This chapter w ill define <br>small businesses; give id eas for small -business start -ups; explain factors contributing to small -business failure; <br>note the role of small businesses; indicate different small -business cate gories; and finally, discuss the macro <br>environment of sma ll businesses in emerging economies.  Next, we will define a small business in an emerging <br>economy such as South Africa.  <br>2.2 DEFINING SMALL BUSINESSES IN EMERGING ECONOMIES  <br>Secondary research (Phakisa , 2013) indicates that there is no universally accepted definition for a small <br>business becau se what is regarded in the US as a small business would often be regarded as a medium -sized <br>business elsewhere in the world. In South Africa, Phakisa (2013) define s an enterprise with fewer than 100 <br>employees as a small  business whereas in Egypt it is defi ned as having more than five and fewer than 50 <br>employees. This can be compared to another emerging country, for example Vietnam, where they consider a <br>SME to have between 10 and 300 employees. With regard to developed c ountries, the Inter -American <br>Developm ent Bank defines an American small business as having a maximum of 100 employees compared to <br>the European SMEs with fewer than 250 employees (Natarajan & Wyrick, 2 011). The following economies <br>are considered to be “emer ging”: Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia , Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Mexico, <br>Russia and South Africa.  <br>As mentioned, a small business is defined in different ways with reference to the number of empl oyees or to <br>turnover (as in the National Small Business Act of 1996). In South Africa, a smal l business is officially defined <br>in section 1 of the National Small Business Act of 1996 as amended by the National Small Business <br>Amendment Acts of 2003 and 2004 as a separate and distinct business entity. This include s cooperative <br>enterprises and non -governmental organisations, managed by one owner or more which, including its branches <br>or subsidiaries, if any, is predominantly operated in any sector or subsector o f the economy.  <br>The National Small Business Act categoris es South African small businesses int o the following distinct <br>groups: the survivalist, micro, very small, small and medium businesses. The term “SMME” is therefore used <br>to describe small, medium and m icro-enterprises. However, in South Africa the terms “SM ME” and “SME” <br>are used interchangeabl y. In South Africa, the SME is defined by the number of employees per enterprise -size <br>category combined with the annual turnover category and the gross assets excl uding fixed property. The <br>National Small Business Act 10 2 of 1996 provides definitions for va rious SMME categories as identified <br>in Table 2.1 . 41 <br> Table 2.1 Definitions of SME s given in the National Small Business Act  <br>Enterprise <br>size Number of employees  Annual turnover  Gross assets, excluding fixed <br>property  <br>Medium  Fewer than 100 to 200 , <br>depending on industry  Less than R4 million to R50 <br>million, depending on industry  Less than R2 million to R18 <br>million, depending on industry  <br>Small  Fewer than 50  Less than R2 million to R25 <br>million, depending on industry  Less than R2 million to R4,5 <br>million, depending on indust  <br>Very small  Fewer than 10 to 20, <br>depending on industry  Less than R200  000 to R500 000, <br>depending on industry  Less than R150 000 to R500 000, <br>depending on industry  <br>Micro  Fewer than five  Less than R150 000  Less than R100 000  <br>Source:  Dockel & Ligthelm (2012)  <br>As indicated in  Table 2.1 , a small enterprise has fe wer than 50 employees. Currently, there is  a lot of focus in <br>South Africa on the development of SMEs. SMEs in a wide variety of fields and industries are regarded as a <br>major force in economic development and wealth creation. In South Africa, the importance  of an <br>entrepreneurially driven economy is  becoming increasingly important, particularly beca use of the <br>employment -creation opportunities it offers. Globally, the small -business sector is regarded as the main <br>driving force in economic growth and job creati on (Hussaina, Si & Wang, 2013).  <br>The most w idely used framework in South Africa is the definit ion of the National Small Business Act, which <br>defines five categories of business as follows:  <br>• Survivalist enterprise:  the income generated is less than the minimum  income standard or the poverty line. <br>This category is considered pre -entrepreneurial, and in cludes hawkers, vendors and subsistence farmers. <br>(In practice, survivalist enterprises are often categorised as part of the micro -enterprise sector.)  <br>• Micro enterpr ise: the turnover is less than the VAT reg istration limit (that is, R150 000 per year). These  <br>enterprises usually lack formality in terms of registration. They include, for example,  spaza  shops, minibus <br>taxis and household industries. They employ no more t han five people.  <br>• Very small enterprise:  this category includes enterprises employing fewer th an 10 employees, except <br>mining, electricity, manufacturing and construction sectors, in which t he figure is 20 employees. These <br>enterprises operate in the formal m arket and have access to technology.  <br>• Small enterprise:  the upper limit is 50 employees. Small  enterprises are generally more established than <br>very small enterprises and exhibit more comple x business practices.  <br>• Medium enterprise:  the maximum number of emplo yees is 100, or 200 for the mining, electricity, <br>manufacturing and construction sectors. Thes e enterprises are often characterised by the decentralisation <br>of power to an additional managem ent layer.  <br>2.3 FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO START -UP FAILURE IN EMERGING ECONOMIES  <br>Starting a small business includes the possibility of success as well as failure an d because of its small size, a <br>simple management mistake is likely to lead to the failure of an SME, which therefore has no opportunity to <br>learn from its past mist akes. Rese arch conducted by Longenecker, Petty, Moore and Palich (2006) indicates <br>that lack o f planning, improper financing and poor management have been posited as the main causes of failure <br>of small businesses. Lack of credit has also been identified as one of the  most serious constraints facing <br>African small businesses and hindering their devel opment (Oketch, 2007). The National Small Business Act 42 <br> 102 of 1996 paved the way for the launch of a range of entirely new institutions within the Department of <br>Trade and In dustry (DTI) group, including the Ntsika Enterprise Promotion Agency and Khula Ente rprise <br>Finance. Ntsika, which has now been merged to follow the SEDA mission, aims to support small businesses <br>to survive and minimise SME failure. SEFA assists sm all busine sses with a business plan.  <br>2.4 THE ROLE OF SMALL -BUSINESS START -UPS IN THE EMERGING  SOUTH AFRICAN <br>ECONOMY  <br>SMEs play an important role in the development of emerging countries (Fida, 2008). They contribute to <br>economic development by creating emplo yment for  the growing labour force in rural and urban areas; they <br>also generate income, there by providing desirable sustainability and innovation for the economy as a whole <br>and eventually, leading to the reduction of poverty. Maas and Herrington (2006) con firm this  as they state that <br>SMEs are seen as a significant component of the solution to Sout h Africa’s development issues, which include <br>poverty, income inequality and unemployment. A recent study conducted by Abor and Quartey (2010) <br>estimates that 91 per  cent of formal business entities in South Africa are SMEs, and these SMEs contribute <br>between  51 and 57 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and provide about 61 per cent of the country’s <br>employment; Van Scheers (2011) also confirms these statistic s. The Ba nking Association of South Africa and <br>member banks are committed to small -business d evelopment and offer support through stakeholder <br>engagement, and involvement or ownership of several initiatives. Other initiatives described by Fatoki and <br>Akinwum i (2010) that promote the development of small businesses include the current framework of sm all-<br>business support and development in South Africa, which comprises the following:  <br>• The White Paper on National Strategy for the Development and Promotion of Smal l Busines s (DTI, 1995), <br>which sets out the government’s strategy in this regard  <br>• The Centre fo r Small Business Promotion, which has also been established by the government with the goals <br>of creating an enabling environment for the growth and expansion of SM Es and of  developing and <br>supporting the institutions involved in delivering support services to SMEs  <br>Developing economies often have high numbers of low -capital businesses that manufacture or sell similar <br>products that will decrease unemployment. Next idea s for sma ll-business start -ups will be discussed.  <br>2.5 IDEAS FOR SMALL -BUSINESS START -UPS IN E MERGING ECONOMIES  <br>Emerging markets have fast -growing low -income consumers, which could be used for test sites for innovative <br>products. Low -cost engineering product s such as  Tata’s Nano city car, to infrastructure -advancing, for <br>example, mobile banking, whi ch permitted companies to penetrate huge new emerging markets. Small -<br>business owners should offer products that will satisfy the needs of the consumers in their sp ecific em erging <br>market. Unfortunately it is impossible to satisfy all the needs of all the co nsumers in a particular market, <br>therefore the small -business owner should segment the market and target a specific customer. The aim of the <br>small business is to ma intain pr ofitability over the long term, therefore it has to do marketing research to keep <br>up to date with the changes in consumer needs and to change the product offering to satisfy the needs of the <br>customer.  <br>Ideas for new business start -ups should consid er custom ers’ needs in emerging economies such as collecting <br>and recycling waste. A good exam ple is to design a biogas container from recycled plastic that can be carried <br>on the consumer’s back like a backpack. Biogas can be used to provide poor rural hous eholds wi th an <br>affordable source of energy for lighting or cooking. Another example of a busi ness start -up idea is to create <br>online IT training courses like Hyperion Development (http://www.ventureburn .com ). This company provide <br>affordable online courses to the disadvantaged youth in South Af rica. 43 <br> Low-cost business ideas  <br>Become a computer tutor  <br>Catering business  <br>Computer repair service  <br>Become a garage cleaning service  <br>Become a handy man  <br>Start an office  and home  organizer  <br>Mobile mechanic  <br>Cover letter and résumé service  <br>Source:  Abor & Quartey (2 010) <br>2.6 SMALL -BUSINESS START -UP CATEGORIES  <br>South Africa is a country that supports the system of free enterprise. This means that any person is free to start <br>a business aimed at making a profit. Profit -seeking businesses can be classified by type of busin ess activities <br>or organisational form. The d ifferent types of businesses will now be discussed.  <br>2.6.1 Different categories of ownership  <br>Businesses can be classifie d according to organisational form. Business ownership refers to the way in which <br>a business is owned and managed. The owners have to dec ide on how to raise capital, who is responsible for <br>losses and how the profit will be divided. Common forms of ownershi p are sole trader, partnership, limited <br>liability companies and close corporations.  <br>2.6.1.1 S ole trader  <br>This business is owned by one ind ividual and managed by the same person. Many small service businesses <br>such as general dealers,  spaza  shops, plumbers, h airdressers and lawyers are sole traders. There are no legal <br>formalities other than a licence  to trade, and a limited investment is requi red to start such a business. The <br>owner is responsible for contributing the funds or capital required by the business. The owner accepts all the <br>risks involved, bears any losses and gets the profit of the busines s. The owner is also liable, in his personal  <br>capacity, for the debts of the business.  <br>The owner is also taxed on the profit of the business and the owner declares the profit on his personal income <br>tax return. This is done because the sole trader is not a j uristic person distinct from its owner. We c an say that <br>the business has no legal “personality” and cannot be summoned to court. When the owner of the sole trader <br>dies, the business ceases to exist. If the business activities are taken over by someone else , a new soletrade <br>business comes into being.  <br>Advantages  <br>The main advantages of the sole -trader business are that it is easy to set up and control the business. The  sole <br>trader  44 <br> • makes all the decisions  <br>• keeps all the profits  <br>• controls the business  <br>• starts with minimum capital  <br>• has a simple management system.  <br>Disadvantages  <br>• There is unlimited liability for debts of the business and the risk of losing personal wealth if the business <br>fails. <br>• Lack of capital means the business stays small.  <br>• There will be lack of continu ity in the busin ess if the sole trader dies and then the business will also die.  <br>2.6.1.2 Partnership  <br>A partnership is created by a verbal or written agreement betw een the partners, specifying each partner’s role <br>and the extent to which each will share in t he profits and losses of the partnership. There have to be at least <br>two partners, but not more than 20 in a partnership. Firms of medical doctors usually form part nerships so that <br>if one partner is away the other will attend to the practice.  <br>Like the sole trader, the par tners in a partnership are actively involved in the day -to-day running of the <br>business. Because of the lack of legal personality, the owners (partne rs), like the sole trader, are also liable in <br>their personal capacities for the debts of the partnership. Ta xes from partnership profits are paid by the partners <br>personally. Where a partner dies or withdraws from the partnership, or a new partner is admitt ed to the <br>partnership, the old partnership ceases to exist and a new partnership is formed. P artners share l osses and <br>profit according to the ratio stipulated in the partnership agreement.  <br>Advantages  <br>• It is easy to set up.  <br>• Professional assistance is gained through taking on an experienced or qualified partner.  <br>• More partners mean more capital.  <br>• The r esponsibility o f managing the business is shared.  <br>Disadvantages  <br>• Unlimited liability partners could lose all their personal wealth to pay for the debts of the busin ess. <br>• There is a lack of continuity if one of the partners dies, resigns or is declared bankru pt; in such cas es the <br>partnership is automatically dissolved and would have to be reformed.  <br>• Partners can take decisions without consulting the other partners and t hese decisions are binding.  <br>2.6.1.3 Limited liability company  <br>This form of business ownership  is very common in the business world. A company is formed when a large <br>amount of capital is required to establish a business, or when the owners wish to limit the ir responsibility for <br>debts to the original amount contributed . The owners of a company are c alled shareholders. People who are <br>not the owners often manage it. The rules and regulations governing the formation and running of a company <br>are contained in the Companies Act 71 of 2008, which was signed by the president on  8 April 2009 and <br>gazetted in  Gazette  No. 32121 (Notice No. 421). The Act replaces the Companies Act 61 of 1973 and came <br>into effect on 1 May 2011.  <br>Two types of limited liability companies exist  in South Africa, namely the private and public limited liabil ity <br>company. The shares of a pr ivate company like Coin Security are not traded on the stock exchange. We say <br>that Coin is unlisted and because of the restriction on the free transferability of i ts shares, it is called a private <br>company. Its full name is Co in Security (Proprietary) Limit ed. The word “Proprietary”’ (or abbreviated as 45 <br> “Pty”) denotes that it is a private company. A private company may have a minimum of one and a maximum <br>of 50 shareho lders. They are, however, often required to sign surety for th e debts of that company. The <br>shareholders and directors of the private company are often the same people.  <br>A public company can have an unlimited number of owners (shareholders). Think, for examp le, of Jet Stores. <br>Anybody can buy Jet Stores’ shares on the J SE. We say that Jet Stores is a  listed company  and because it can <br>sell its shares to the general public, it is also referred to as a public company. The full name of Pep Stores is <br>Pep Stores Lim ited. The word “Limited” (abbreviated as “Ltd”) denotes that i t is a company limited by share  <br>capital. A public company must have at least seven owners (called shareholders or members), except in the <br>case of a wholly -owned subsidiary, where another company  holds all the shares in that company. The <br>shareholders of a l isted company cannot be held li able for the debts of the company. If the company goes <br>bankrupt, the shareholders will lose only the share capital contributed by them. The owners (shareholders) o f <br>a listed company are, as a rule, not employed by that compan y; the directors of the company  will be responsible <br>for the daily business activities.  <br>Remember!!  <br>The word “Limited” (or the abbreviation “Ltd”) denotes a company limited by share capital.  <br>The w ord “Proprietary” (or abbreviation “Pty”) denotes a private co mpany.  <br>Advantages  <br>• Each sharehol der has limited liability and does not risk personal wealth.  <br>• The business has continuity.  <br>• Large amounts of capital can be raised in relatively short time periods.  <br>Disadvantages  <br>• Legal formalities need to be sorted out before t he company may trade.  <br>• There are  legal constraints on how to run the company.  <br>• The company is accountable to its shareholders and creditors.  <br>• A complex management system is needed.  <br>The sole proprie torship (sole trader), the partnership, and private and public companies are all different le gal <br>business categories. Each form has its own characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, which distinguish <br>it from the others. The main differ ences between th e various categories of business will be discussed.  <br>2.6.1.4 Legal personality  <br>Some businesses  have a legal personality or form an entity. These businesses can exist independently of their <br>owners. This means that the owners are not liable fo r the debt of th e business. These businesses have an <br>unlimited life span because they are not dependent on th e life span of their owners.  <br>Certain businesses can be formed easily without legal consideration while some can take considerable time, <br>effort and complicated proc edures to establish.  <br>2.6.1.5 Ownership and management  <br>The extent to which owners of the busin ess share in the management, income (profits) and losses, varies from <br>one type of business to another. When the business has more than one owner, a  mutual agreemen t has to be <br>reached on how the business will be managed and how the profits and losses will b e shared.  46 <br> 2.6.1.6 Obtaining capital  <br>The size and nature of the business will determine the amount of initial capital required. Some businesses need  <br>more capital th an others; for example, a  spaza  shop will need less capital than a factory manufacturing spar e <br>motor parts.  <br>2.6.1.7 Division of income (profits)  <br>The different business categories have different ways of distributing profits. The owner of a s ole trader is <br>entitled to the total income, while in other cases income is distributed according to a specifi c ratio or according <br>to shares owned.  <br>Remember!!  <br>There is no ideal form of ownership. The business owner has to take into account the specific circ umstances of his  own <br>business and choose the form that suits him best.  <br>2.7 THE MACRO ENVIRONMENT OF START -UP BUSINESSES IN EMERGING <br>ECONOMIES  <br>The management environment consists of three subenvironments namely: the micro environment, the market <br>environment  and the macro e nvironment. These three subenvironments are interdependent, and in this chapter <br>the macro env ironment will be explained. The micro environment and market environment will be discussed <br>in Chapter 8 . <br>2.7.1 The macro environment  <br>The macro environment includes all factors that can influence the organisation, but that are out of the <br>company’s direct co ntrol. A company does not generally influence any laws (although it is accepted that they <br>could lobby or be part of a trade organisat ion). The macro environment is continuously changing, and the <br>company needs to be flexible in order to adapt to change. The re may be aggressive competition and rivalry in <br>a market. Globalisation means that there is a lways the threat of substitute products and new entrants. The <br>wider environment is also ever changing, and the marketer needs to compensate for changes and challen ges <br>in culture, politics, economics and technology, which will be discussed next.  <br>2.7.1.1 Cha llenges presented by the macro environme nt <br>Changes in economic conditions are the most important factors for a small business to deal with because these <br>factors ha ve an immediate and large effect on the wellbeing of a small business. The challenge for the small <br>business is to keep up with all th ese changes and to seek new opportunities to exploit, and also to deal with <br>threats that these forces have on their busines s. Monetary, social, technological, global or international, <br>physical and political challenge s will be outlined shortly.  <br>2.7.1.2 Mon etary policy challenges  <br>The monetary policy challenges include changes in interest rates, inflation, the rate of taxation an d the <br>exchange rate. For example, interest rates: small businesses pay interest on money they  borrow and they also <br>receive interest when they invest money. Small businesses also charge interest when customers buy goods on <br>credit. Therefore an increase or d ecrease in interest  rates affects business activities as well as the buying habits <br>of their c ustomers. The rate of taxation on the c ustomer will have an impact on spending power and therefore <br>also on the survival of the business. If customers do not buy pr oducts, the small business will not survive.  47 <br> Monetary challenges such as interest rates, infl ation and exchange rates can have a neg ative impact on the <br>business when there are sudden changes or fluctuations. If the rand increases in value against our major  trading <br>partners, it will make it more difficult for local companies to compete against chea per imported goods. On the <br>other hand, a stronger currency means capital goods and resources can then be imported more cheaply.  <br>Small businesses need to focus more  on productivity in an attempt to meet the challenges of higher inflation <br>or less favourable exchange rates. Changes in the income l evels of customers will have a direct impact on the <br>sales turnover. In times of economic growth and development, more people  will have jobs, which in turn will <br>result in higher sales. The opposite is also true when th e economy is not growing or even shrink ing. In such a <br>case the overall income levels of people will be lower and fewer people can afford goods and services.  <br>2.7.1. 3 Social challenges  <br>A social force such as HIV and AIDS can be a major threat to a small busi ness in that it can result in a loss of  <br>skilled and experienced workers. The small business can deal with this challenge by investing in its workers <br>through HIV an d AIDS education programmes and the provision of anti -retroviral drugs to prolong the lives <br>of affected workers.  <br>2.7.1.4 Technologic al challenges  <br>Changes in technology also offer opportunities, such as ecommerce, where products and services can be sold <br>via the internet. The business needs to invest in its workforce to equip them with the necessary  skills to work <br>in a technological envi ronment.  <br>2.7.1.5 Global challenges  <br>Global challenges such as the threat of cheaper imported goods and little protection in t he way of import taxes <br>also present serious challenges to an enterprise. Management and the w orkers need to cooperate in order to <br>survive in a highly competitive global environment. Productivity levels and the best technology need to be <br>employed to meet th e challenge of cheap imported goods. On the other hand, globalisation offers export and <br>offsh ore investment opportunities.  <br>2.7.1.6 P hysical challenges  <br>The physical factors are scarce resources such as water, fossil oil, pollution and environmental damages.  The <br>world’s fossil -oil resources are decreasing as a result of fast -growing countries like C hina using more energy <br>to produce produ cts. The Kyoto agreement on pollution and the environment came into effect into 2005. This <br>is an agreement whereby most gove rnments throughout the world agreed to reduce carbon pollution to protect <br>the earth’s atmosph ere. Greater social awareness and gover nment commitment to reducing pollution will put <br>pressure on businesses to display greater environmental responsibilities.  <br>We have already learnt that the business will use raw material and other physical resources in the course of <br>production. The supplies of these natural resources are often not sustainable, which means that these resources <br>may become depleted and therefore nee d to be properly managed at all times. The physical challenges are to <br>try to protect scarce r esources such as water and fossil fuel,  and to reduce pollution and environmental <br>damages.  <br>2.7.1.7 Political challenges  <br>Political instability and restrictive legis lation can negatively affect investment and growth in South Africa. It <br>is therefore important  for the business community to engage w ith the government and the labour movement <br>to ensure sound macro environmental policies, which are conducive to trade and in vestment.  <br>Labour legislation, which forms part of the political environment, also presents un ique challenges to South <br>African small businesses, for example, the attainment of equity targets and black business empowerment. The 48 <br> small business can turn these challenges into advantages by entering into partnership with suitable <br>empowerment stakeholder s who can add value to the  small busine ss. An equity plan needs to be in place to <br>ensure a smooth transition of skills to equity appointees. The political factors have a huge influence upon the <br>regulation of a business and the spending power of consumers a nd other businesses.  <br>2.7.2 Strategies t o overcome macro environmental challenges  <br>Small businesses need to devise strategies to overcome macro environmental challen ges that affect their <br>business operations. The small -business sector creates employment and i ncome that the formal sector cannot <br>provide. As such, the sector provides the livelihood of many communities and it is therefore imperative that <br>finance, training and land is made available to this sector so that the self -employed can continue to drive the ir <br>own destiny. It is important that sm all businesses do not only focus on a single market but that they provide a <br>range of market goods and services to ensure tha t the whole sector does not collapse when a certain sector is <br>experiencing difficulties.  <br>The first strategy for the small -business sector is to create a means of receiving credit and funding.  <br>The second strategy is to develop training facilities and give t he small -business owners access to technology <br>and machinery. This will ensure that the sm all-business sector has a comparative advantage, in terms of the <br>product and viability, with other competing sectors within the region and outside the region.  <br>The thir d strategy is to develop community -based tourism and small -scale farming projects to enha nce small -<br>business development. Access to land, and in some instances housing, is necessary to operate such ventures.  <br>The last strategy is the target market strategy, which focuses on the target customer, the pricing structures and <br>the geographic target ma rkets to create a strategy for the small business. The more statistical information and <br>knowledge the small business has about a target market, the more precisely a ta rget market strategy can be <br>developed.  <br>2.8 CONCLUSION  <br>Small business start -ups are consid ered to be the panacea for South Africa’s emerging economy as they <br>contribute significantly to job creation, social stability and economic welfare.  <br>In this chapter, sm all businesses in emerging economies were  defined ; ideas for small -business start -ups were <br>provided; factors contributing to small -business failure were debated; the role of smal l businesses in emerging <br>economies was discussed; different small -business categories were explained; and finally, the macro <br>environment of small businesses in eme rging economies was highlighted. Throughout the chapter the link <br>between small -business s tart-ups and the emerging economy in which they operate was emphasised. It was <br>illustrated that small -business startups in emerging economies differ from start -ups in developed Western <br>countries.  <br>REVIEW QUESTIONS  <br>2.1 Compare the characteristics of developed ec onomies and emerging economies; illustrate your answer with practical <br>examples.  <br>2.2 Debate definitions of SMEs with reference to the National Small Business Act 10 2 of 1996.

Neethling  <br>LEARNING OUTCOMES  <br>After you have studied this chapter you will be able to  <br>▪ explain the importance of a feasibility study  <br>▪ discuss the elements of a feasibility study  <br>▪ conduct a feasibility study on any idea or business  <br>▪ identify and explain the typical elements  of a feasibility  study that are more common to developing economies.  <br>KEY TER MS <br>▪ Industry attractiveness  <br>▪ Technical feasibility  <br>▪ Product/service feasibility analysis  <br>▪ Concept test  <br>▪ Prototype and usability testing  <br>▪ Emerging industries  <br>▪ Declining industries  <br>▪ Financi al feasibility an alysis  <br>▪ Estimated earnings  <br>3.1 INTRODUCTION  <br>Once an entrepren eur comes up with an idea for a new product or service, the entrepreneur should conduct a <br>feasibility analysis to determine the likelihood that the perceived idea will be a succes s; that is, whether the <br>idea can be converted into a profita ble business vent ure. A feasibility analysis precedes a business plan, and <br>the entrepreneur might, after conducting the feasibility analysis, decide to drop or rethink the business idea, <br>especiall y if the product, industry or financial appeal is not attrac tive enough to su pport establishing a business <br>venture. The feasibility study may also highlight shortcomings that need to be addressed, before the <br>product/service can be successfully introduced i nto the marketplace. Alternately, the analysis could lead th e <br>entrepreneur to  conclude that a great need and therefore great opportunity exists for the idea to be successfully <br>introduced and accepted by the market.  <br>The feasibility analysis addresses variou s criteria against which the idea needs to be evaluated. A d istinction <br>betwee n developed and developing countries is sometimes necessary when conducting a feasibility study, as <br>a developing economy often does not have the same infrastructure in place as a developed economy, and <br>accordingly might not be as suitable for a particular new idea as a developed economy might be. Context may <br>therefore be important when conducting the feasibility study and budding entrepreneurs might be compelled <br>to review their mar ket entry strategies, if the market or country is not yet re ady for that inve ntion or idea.  <br>Barringer and Ireland (2012) describe the feasibility analysis in terms of four stages namely: product or service <br>feasibility; industry and market feasibility; orga nisational feasibility; and financial feasibility, which wil l be <br>discussed in  the following section. However, a developing economy requires  more aspects  to be exa mined. <br>This chapter also looks at the  technical and legal feasibilit y of an idea.  <br>CASE STUDY:  Opportunities created by crime  <br>AGV Security Services is a business venture that was formed with the specific aim to provide protection and medical services <br>for tourists t ravelling within the Western Cape. Two of the founder member s were employed i n the security industry where 54 <br> they were sometimes called out to perform special duties such as protecting tourists at business venues. Experience in the <br>protection industry, and e xtraordinary services rendered to tourists in the course of their work, indic ated to the members of <br>this organisation that perhaps there existed a need for a specialised service for the protection of tourists to South Africa.  <br>The founding members approache d the Small Enterprise Development Agency (SEDA) for support , which assisted them in <br>drafting and conducting a feasibility study.  <br>After describing the need for the service, namely the protection of tourists visiting South Africa, the members had to identi fy <br>how they were going to sell this particular service. Durin g the deliberatio n process, the following potential buyers of their <br>services were identified:  <br>• Foreign tour groups/tour organisers  <br>• Locally organised tour operators  <br>• Wine -route establishments  <br>• Municip al districts offering popular tourist attractions  <br>• Businesses  housing and serv ing tourists  <br>As the group lacked contact with foreign -based tour organisers, they decided to approach local tour operators and local bus <br>companies providing guided tours in the We stern Cape.  <br>They also approached local municipalities housing popular tourist  sites to enq uire whether such institutions were willing to pay <br>for additional security for tourists during designated times. Their thinking was that institutions could either inc lude in the <br>admission costs a charge for the provision of security services, or alternatel y that the security services could be seen as an <br>operating expense for the local authorities.  <br>Local restaurants, wine farms and guesthouses were also approached with the intention of offering a perimeter of secure <br>wining and dining and accompa nied security  for the guests on their way home.  <br>As part of the analysis on the market structure and size, the members acquired statistics from various sources, identifying t he <br>numbers of tourists to South Africa annually and more particularly to the Wester n Cape. Data was also gathered on the profile <br>of tourists visiting the province.  <br>As part of their financial feasibility analysis, the members sought to explore whether tour operat ors were willing to add a levy <br>to their services, to cover the costs of provi ding a differ entiated product, namely a secure and safe tour experience. The service <br>was offered on an hourly basis and income calculations were done on the basis of the number of  tours they could <br>accommodate per day. Start -up and operating expenses were k ept to a mini mum and founding members initially provided <br>transport at a cost to the business when workers needed to be transported. Registration with the Security Services Board w as <br>one of the big start -up expenses that AGV had to incur.  <br>The security servi ces industry is a highly regulated industry with various prescriptions that have to be met in order to offer <br>services in this industry. In terms of technical and legal feasibility , the team realised that one of the operational requirements <br>was that all emp loyees operat ing within the sector had to be formally registered. Regulations made under the Private Security <br>Industry Regulation Act included: applications for registration as a security service provider; training requirements for <br>registration; clearance certificates;  infrastructure and capacity necessary to render a security service; a register of security <br>service providers; certificates of registration; and various prescriptions  relating to the management of and record -keeping of <br>employees.  <br>Besides the m anagement of the firm that was addressed by the organisational feasibility section, the team also had to identify <br>how they were going to acquire and maintain the necessary skilled  staff, and provide the services that were prescribed by <br>legislation. The tea m also needed  to acquire suitable premises as prescribed by the Act.  <br>The feasibility analysis revealed that tour operators were not interested in providing security services as pa rt of their tour <br>package. The team faced similar reluctance from municipal au thorities own ing popular tourist destinations, who expressed <br>that they either did not see the need for such protection and security services or felt that existing security provide d was <br>adequate. Only for ad hoc major events would they consider beefing up t he security p rovided. The team got the greatest <br>support for their idea from business owners such as restaurant owners, who wanted to provide a safe and secure environment <br>for tour ists visiting their establishments. This then enabled the team to identify th eir staff req uirements and offer a focused <br>service in order to provide the services demanded by the market.  <br> 55 <br> 3.2 PRODUCT/SERVICE FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS  <br>The aim of the product or service feasibility analysis includes:  <br>• To determine whether the planned product or service is  attractive to the envisaged market in the form and <br>price intended  <br>• To determine the ease of use, suitability for purpose, or challenges potential users might encou nter when <br>using the product for the first time  <br>• To gather feedback from the consu mer, which ca n be used to make the necessary adjustments to the <br>product or service before releasing it to the market  <br>• To determine whether forecasts can be made to reflect the e xpected demand for the product.  <br>The steps followed in this process are: to condu ct market res earch to determine if there is a need for the product <br>or service; to undertake a concept test (utilising a concept statement); to develop a prototype and conduct <br>usability testing; and to use the feedback gathered to determine whether or not t o proceed wit h a business idea. <br>If the research or test indicates that there is no need or demand for the product or service, the budding <br>entrepreneur might decide not to imple ment the rest of the steps listed above.  <br>Barringer and Ireland (2012) identified  two components to a product or service feasibility analysis, namely <br>product/service desirability and product/service demand. An inventor or entrepreneur is often excited about  <br>an idea but that excitement does not nec essarily translate into interest on the  part of the consumer. The <br>entrepreneur needs to determine whether it is possible to provide the product or service at a profit, and whether <br>there is sufficient demand by custo mers to ensure that the product/service c an be delivered at a profit in an <br>ongoi ng manner. Scarborough (2011) states that the easiest way to answer these questions is to engage in <br>primary and secondary research. Primary research could be conducted where  <br>• data is collected using customer surveys an d questionnaires  <br>• focus group discussion s are used by enlisting a small number of potential customers (8 to 12) to give the <br>entrepreneur feedback on what they liked or disliked about the product/ service.  <br>Secondary r esearch could entail accessing informatio n from sources such as trade and indust ry associations, <br>published reports including market research reports, newspaper reports, trade magazines and journal articles <br>and well as the information on the internet.  <br>An al ternate manner of determining the desirab ility of a product or service is to con duct a concept test, which <br>involves an instrument called a concept statement.  <br>3.2.1 Concept test  <br>Before money is spent on building a prototype of the new product, the idea or c oncept should be tested, by <br>presenting a concept statement to  selected individua ls. Once satisfactory feedback has been received, the <br>entrepreneur will then go ahead and develop a prototype, which can then be tested for its suitability and ease <br>of use. The  concept statement can be presented to in dustry experts and individuals who are familiar with the <br>industry and might be interested in the product or service offered. The concept test can then be used to serve <br>the following purposes:  <br>• To validate the assumpt ion that has been made regarding the prod uct/service: by providing individuals w ith <br>the concept statement, potential customers can be asked to complete a short questionnaire that will <br>assist the entrepreneur to determine whether the assumptions he or she m ade regarding the consumer <br>and the produc t/service were correct.  <br>• To use customer  feedback to help tweak the idea: by asking potential customers to offer comments or make <br>suggestions on how the idea could be improved, potential customers could contribute to wards tweaking <br>the product into its final  format.  <br>• A buying intentions survey cou ld also be attached to a concept statement, to determine if there is a demand <br>for the product or service. Such a survey would ask whether the potential customer “would definite ly <br>buy”, “would probably buy”, “might” or  “might not” buy the envisaged product or service. In assessing 56 <br> customer interest, the scores of respondents who have indicated that they definitely and probably would <br>buy, are tallied and used as an indication of c ustomer interest and how many people woul d actually buy <br>the product or service.  <br>3.2.2 Concept statement  <br>The concept statement is a short, preliminary description of the product or service idea. The concept statement <br>includes the following items:  <br>• A descript ion of the product or service being offer ed: this section often includes a sketc h in the case of a <br>product, so that the prospective customer could see how the intended product would look. It would also <br>include features of the product or service that would enable the prospective consumer to expres s an <br>opinion on his or her attitude tow ards the intended product/service. The response received at this stage <br>would assist in building the prototype that incorporates the feedback and intention that the entrepreneur  <br>had in mind.  <br>• The benefits of the product  or service:  this section highlights th e benefits and value that the product or <br>service offers potential users as well as the needs and wants that it aims to address or problems that it <br>seeks to solve.  <br>• The intended target market:  this section lists the con sumers or businesses that are expected to be <br>interested in the product or service to be offered.  <br>• A description of how the product will be positioned relative to its competitors:  by utilising a positioning <br>map, the e ntrepreneur is forced to think of the cri teria that would be used to distinguish  his or her <br>product or service from that of competitors.  <br>• A description of how the product or service will be sold or distributed:  this section forces the entrepreneur <br>to think of strategies and channels of distributio n that need to be utilised in order to get a product or <br>service to the consumer.  <br>• A brief  description  of the company’s management team.  <br>3.2.3 Prototype and usability testing  <br>After conducting a concept test, a prototy pe model of the product could be develope d. The prototype is the <br>first depiction  of the new product; it is a model of the eventual product, and is designed so that potential <br>customers can see what the final product could look like and how it is likely to w ork. Prototypes could be <br>given to potenti al customers to use in order to get fee dback on the product. (Websites to visit <br>include  http://www.rapdasa.org/  or http://www.ideaprototype.co.z a/). Feedback would include impressions  <br>by the consumer on the ease of use, preference (e.g. size, colour), what worked well and what the consumer <br>did not like. The aim of usability testing is to identify problems u sers experience and express while using t he <br>product. This will enable the entrep reneur to incorporate the feedback from the usability testing process before <br>the final product is released to the marketplace.  <br>Another technique that could be used is  “in-home trials”, where researchers are sent into customers’ homes to <br>observe how custome rs use the entrepreneur’s products or services, and in so doing identify difficulties <br>experienced when using the product so that improvements can be made to the product.  <br>3.3 IN DUSTRY AND MARKET FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS  <br>When conducting an industry analysis, the  potential and attractiveness of the industry is examined. An industry <br>consists of a group of firms producing similar products or providing similar services that distingu ish <br>themselves from other types of businesses or services. The manufacturing or techni cally productive enterprises <br>in a particular field, collectively, therefore form an industry, for instance: the music industry; fitness and <br>health; security (protection s ervice s); or the building industry. A firm may compete in a particular industry, <br>but d ecide to focus on a particular market within that industry.  57 <br> It is useful to know which type of industry the business is competing in as each type of industry exhibits <br>different  characteristics in terms of the adoption of new products or new ideas. With hig hly innovative <br>products, best described by the technology adoption life cycle, an innovation is adopted at different rates. In <br>such cases the first group of people to ado pt or use a new product is referred to as innovators, followed by the <br>early adopters, early and late majority, with the last group to adopt the product being referred to as laggards.  <br>3.3.1 Types of industries  <br>There are various types of industries, with eac h type  of industry offering different opportunities. The following <br>types of industries  can be identified:  <br>• Emerging industries:  an emerging industry is a new industry in which standard operating procedures have <br>yet to be developed. A high level of uncertainty cha racterises emerging industries, yet many new ventures <br>enter emerging industries as the barriers to entry are usually low with no established pattern of rivalry. <br>Due to the high level of uncertainty in these industries, success may be short -lived with new i nnovations <br>constantly changing the nature of competition, for example the cellul ar market.  <br>• Fragmented industries:  a fragm ented industry is one that is characterised by a large number of firms of <br>approximately the same size.  <br>• Mature industries:  a mature indu stry is an industry that is experiencing slow or no increase in demand, has <br>nume rous repeat customers, and has limited pr oduct innovation. A challenge in this industry for a new <br>entrant is the cost associated with marketing and distributing, in order to ac hieve awareness and a <br>presence in the market.  <br>• Declining industries:  a declining industry is an industry that is experienc ing a reduction in demand and is <br>therefore not an attractive industry to enter. An opportunity here would be to revolutionise the indus try <br>by becoming the leader in a niche segment of the industry by creating uncont ested new market space <br>that makes the com petition irrelevant, for instance, Cirque du Soleil. See the reference to Cirque du Soleil <br>at the end of this  chapter for more information . <br>• Global industries:  a global industry is an industry that is experiencin g significant international sales. A start -<br>up entering this industry usually tri es to appeal to an international market f rom the very first day of <br>operation and is typically found in internet -based businesses.  <br>3.3.2 Attractive industries  <br>An industry is sai d to be attractive if it fulfils one of the following characteristics:  <br>• Is large and growing (with growth being more impo rtant than size)  <br>• Is not crowded (not too many competitors)  <br>• Is fairly young rather than older and more mature  <br>• Has high operating margins – high profit margins are typically associated with large and growing industries  <br>where the level competition is still lo w. <br>• Is considered to be an important industry to the consumer. Owing to the changing demands and lifestyle of <br>consumers, certain services  have become critically important to consumers,  for example cooked meals at <br>stores such as SPAR and Food Lover’s Market as opposed to the unhealthier fast -foods option.  <br>3.3.3 Nature of competition  <br>When conducting an industry feasibility analysis, the entre preneur would also explore the nature and degree <br>of competition in that industry . The following types of competition can be identified:  <br>• Direct competition:  direct competitors are businesses offerin g identical or similar products to one’s own <br>business. Dire ct competitors target the same customer.  <br>• Indirect competition:  indirect competit ors are businesses offering close substitute products. Indirect <br>competitors compete against each other by aiming to s atisfy the same need, for example a need for <br>entertainment.  58 <br> • Future competition:  future competitors are businesses that are not yet direct o r indirect competitors but <br>could become competitors at any time, for example books being sold via the internet.  <br>3.3.4  Profitability of the industry  <br>When conducting an industry analysis, one could also examine the profitability of the industry, which would <br>also be another way of looking at the impact of competition on the industry. Porter’s Five Forces model <br>relating to i ndustry competitiveness looks at the level of competitivene ss in an industry and can be used to <br>determine the possible impact the level of competitiveness can have on the profitability of a firm in an industry. <br>Factors that affect the profitability of an i ndustry are:  <br>• Threat of substitutes:  the higher the level or  availability of substitute products, the less attractive the <br>industry becomes a s consumers might opt for substitute products, especially when price becomes an <br>issue. By acquiring a patented new pr oduct, a firm may be protected for a limited period of time , in order <br>to exploit the benefits of patenting, before the patent expires.  <br>• Barg aining power of buyers:  if a firm is dependent on a few large clients for the bulk of its sales, that firm <br>may be vul nerable to the demands of such buyers, for example price re ductions, especially where there is <br>a large amount of supplies. The more standar dised a product is, the easier it is to be substituted.  <br>• Bargaining power of suppliers:  where there are only a few sup pliers that offer a critical component or <br>product to the in dustry, those suppliers can manipulate the price and quality supplied to firms, as there <br>are no alternative suppliers from which to purchase the product. This can therefore be a threat to the <br>profi tability of firms in an industry, as exorbitant costs might  drive clients away from that industry.  <br>• Threat of new entrants:  where the threat  of new entrants is low, for example as a result of high barriers to <br>entry, the industry would be attractive and the threat to profitability low. If an entrepreneur introduces a <br>new product to the market that can be easily duplicated, his level of profitab ility will be threatened by <br>new firms entering the industry.  <br>• Rivalry among existing entrants:  the level of competitio n within an industry directly affects the profitability <br>of the firm. In a highly competitive industry, with many identical products for con sumers to choose from, <br>a high level of price competition and aggressive marketing may exist, which will affect one’s profitability in <br>that industry.  <br>3.3.5 Market factors  <br>Most n ew businesses do not have the resources to target the entire market and would us ually identify a target <br>market. A target market is a segment of the larger market, at which a firm directs its goods/ services and <br>marketing efforts. It is important that the co rrect target market is chosen as a target market could indicate the <br>type of part ners that the firm would need to approach for example the appropriate firm to approach to assist <br>with a promotional c ampaign. This section looks at the market that the entrepre neur hopes to attract to <br>purchase the product or service. It also forces the ent repreneur to compare the new product/service to those <br>being offered in the marketplace that seek to address the same or similar needs.  <br>One way of entering a market, especially in a developing economy, is to try to identify a small yet profitable <br>segment of  the market, often  referred to as a niche market. By focusing on the needs that are deemed to be <br>important to a certa in group of consumers in a niche market, an entrepreneur ca n focus on efficiently adding <br>and creating value to a profitable smaller group o f clients. The following section describes aspects of the <br>market of which budding entrepreneurs need to take cognisan ce. <br>3.3.5.1 Market size and structure  <br>Budding entrepreneurs  would look at the size of the market in order to identify and determine whether  they <br>could capture a segment of that market. The target market that the entrepreneur identifies is those potential <br>consumers that he hopes would purchase his product. In the A GV case study , the own ers decided that the <br>market they would be targeting would b e tour operators servicing tourists visiting the Western Cape. They <br>also identif ied other segments of the market that they could target, if the primary target market was too small. <br>The mere fact th at the feasibility study indicated that the business could not be successfully launched in the 59 <br> manner that they had envisaged does not mean  that the idea in itself was a bad one. Eventually the owners <br>decided on a different target market when they started the business. The same idea could have been <br>successfully im plemented in another market, for example in Gauteng. Likewise if the market that  an <br>entrepreneur has identified is too small, the entrepreneur should think of ways of expanding the target market, <br>to include other segments of the market, in order to make th e business financially sustainable.  <br>The structure of the market refers to the nu mber of buyers and sellers in the market and when analysing the <br>structure of the market, one should also look at the influence that these players have in the market, as their <br>strength could influence the entrepreneur’s perception of the attractiveness of t he market.  <br>A five percent market share of a large market could be insignificant to the large players in the industry but a <br>profitable share for a small growing company, thus th e entrepreneur should try to determine how the players <br>in the industry (large bu yers and sellers) would respond to a new entrant into the marketplace. Strategies used <br>in other parts of the world by  these dominant players could give an entrepreneur an indic ation of the reaction <br>he could expect from these players.  <br>3.3.5.2 Growth and cap acity of the market  <br>A large and growing market creates opportunities for new firms to enter the marketplace. If existing players <br>do not have the capacity to satisfy the demand,  opportunities arise for new firms to enter the industry.  <br>3.3.5.3 Market share  <br>When entering a marke t, an entrepreneur might target a market share that is attainable and profitable for the <br>firm. The entrepreneur could also choose to initially target a nich e segment within the market, provided that <br>the niche segment is large and profit able enough to enter . In a large market, existing competitors might not <br>pay too much attention to a small firm focusing on a niche segment of the market, as the niche segment i s too <br>small a component of the large firm’s market share. With time the firm can  then expand into mo re segments <br>of the market.  <br>3.4 TECHNICAL AND LEGAL FEASIBILITY  <br>Before a new product is introduced to the marketplace, it must be suitable and safe for peopl e to use. Besides <br>the product requiring to meet certain design specifications, a s concluded from the  product feasibility section, <br>the product should be able to be used within the area and market that the entrepreneur has identified. One does <br>not expect to sell electrical appliances in an area where people do not have electricity – unless the product is <br>purchased as a gift or for some other purpose, in which case the demand is unlikely to represent a sustainable <br>business opportunity.  <br>Aspects to be discussed under technical feasibility include the following:  <br>• Availability of infrastructur e: often new product s and services cannot be introduced into an area where <br>there is no infrastructure supporting or enabling the use of the device for instance, electricity, an d <br>information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure.  <br>• Health, safety  and reliability:  a product should be safe to be used when manufactured or sold; for example, <br>the fear that radiation emitted by cellular phones could cause brain cancer initia lly hampered acceptance <br>and adoption of cellular phones.  <br>• Product design and prod uct testing facilit ies: products need to be able to function and should be able to <br>perform under normal operating conditions, as well as under different weather conditions and not pose <br>any danger to consumers when used; for example, clinical trials have to  be conducted to ex amine the <br>effects and potential risks of new drugs and pharmaceutical products, before they will be approved by the <br>relevant authorities.  60 <br> • Technical specifica tions  with regard to product design, as mentioned above: which includes safety, quality <br>and any oth er standards set in that particular country where the product is to be marketed. This includes <br>material used in the production of other goods and services th at need to meet certain minimum <br>standards of production, for example SABS approv al. <br>• Permits and lic ensing:  licences are often required before a business is permitted to operate in a particular <br>industry and failure to acquire a licence can prevent a busines s from starting, for example in the taxi <br>industry.  <br>• Compatibility:  in the case of  supplementary prod ucts (e.g. for cell phones or electronic equipment), the new <br>product must be compatible with the products in the marketplace.  <br>• Legislation preventing the emis sion of harmful gases:  in the manufacturing or application phase, this may <br>also hamper production of the planned product.  <br>• Legislation protecting local industries:  for example, in some countries such as China, foreign firms would <br>only be allowed access to t he local market if they  partnered with a local firm.  <br>• Location of the manufacturi ng unit or sales outlet:  factors that should be considered with regard to location <br>include  <br>– distance from the consumer  <br>– distance from raw material or supplies  <br>– ease of trans portation and service delivery from the intended location  <br>– environmental issues  and legislation.  <br>• Staff availability:  any product needs competent, technically trained staff familiar with the productio n <br>methods or service standards required by the industry.  <br>3.5 FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS  <br>The financial analysis looks at whether it’s  financially feasible to start and operate the business. The aspects <br>to consider in this section include the initial cap ital requirements, estimated earnings from operations an d the <br>resulting return on the investment.  <br>3.5.1 Capital investment  <br>The nature of  the business would give an indication of the capital investment required. Generally service -<br>related businesses require less capital to start operations than manufacturing or r etail-industry businesses. <br>Financial feasibility analysis includes analysing req uired financial resources to acquire the non -current assets <br>such as equipment, building and technology, as well as other  operational costs.  <br>3.5.2 Estimated earnings  <br>The aim of any business is that the income generated by the business should exceed expenses  incurred in the <br>running of that particular business. Two important components used to determine the financial feasibili ty of a <br>business are the income that the business is abl e to generate, and the expenses that the firm needs to incur in <br>order to provide  the goods or services to the marketplace.  <br>One way of determining the financial potential of a new business is to look a t the performance of similar <br>already established busines ses. The prices that existing business charge for their products gives the poten tial <br>entrant an indication of the selling price of goods and services that he or she would have to compete against. <br>The profitability of the venture is a function of the income  generated (the volume of sales at a particular price) <br>less the costs incurred ( the cost of sales and other operating expenses). The entrepreneur should determine the <br>volume of sales the business is a ble to generate in order to determine the income that ca n be generated from <br>sales. The market feasibility gives a good indication of the  potential demand and acceptance of the new 61 <br> business idea that can assist the entrepreneur in estimating potential sales . In determining the estimated <br>earnings of the venture, the entrepreneur should look at the following:  <br>• Profitability:  revenue and cost f orecast.  <br>• The cost of supplies and manufacturing  (providing the service): if manufacturing costs are high, the selling <br>price will accordingly also be high.  <br>• Sales price:  “price” at which the product or service would be sold that would be attractive for the c onsumer <br>as well as profitable for the entrepreneur.  <br>• Profitability of similar businesses in the industry:  this would also  include the prices at which similar <br>products or service s are being sold by competitors. This will also enable the entrepreneur to deter mine <br>whether he would be able to provide a competing product or service at a price equal to that being <br>charged by compet itors.  <br>• Anticipated profit:  whether the anticipated profi t justifies the investment or risk undertaken.  <br>• Breakeven point:  the breakeven po int indicates how many goods or services must be sold or provided at a <br>particular price in order to prevent the company from running at a loss.  <br>• Establishment costs:  discussed i n detail in  section 3.5.2.1 . <br>• Operating costs:  discussed in detail below in  section 3.5.2.2 . <br>• Financing requirements:  the total amount of money needed to start a business a s well as so urces of capital.  <br>3.5.2.1 Establishment costs  <br>Establishment costs ar e the costs related to the start -up of the business. Establishment costs include:  <br>• Product development costs, which includes research and development  <br>• Product testing and buildin g of a proto type  <br>• Market research costs  <br>• Legal costs (intellectual property (IP) p rotection, for example costs relating to the registration of a patent)  <br>• Rental of premises (costs relating to this)  <br>• Costs of machinery and equipment  <br>• Installation, programming an d operationa lising machinery and equipment  <br>• Provision for operating costs, for ex ample salaries and wages, rent, advertising, etc.  <br>– For retail outlets, cash flow for a period of three months should be budgeted for.  <br>– For a manufacturing concern, cash flow should be pr ovided for at least six months.  <br>The determination of establishment c osts indicates to the entrepreneur the total costs required to start a <br>business. This will enable the entrepreneur to determine whether he or she has sufficient funds or the ca pacity <br>to raise sufficient funds to start the business.  <br>3.5.2.2 Operating costs  <br>Whereas establishment costs refer to costs incurred at start -up only, operating costs refer to costs that are <br>incurred regularly during the operation of the firm. These include  the followi ng: <br>• HR-related costs, for example salaries, wages, pensions and medi cal contributions. The higher the costs to <br>employ experienced, qualified staff, the higher the sales figures need to be to cover these expenses.  <br>• Facilities -related costs, for e xample rent,  water, electricity, insurance, instalment payments, security and <br>maintenance. The business cannot exist without these facilities, therefore entrepreneurs need to <br>determine these costs in order to see whether they can operate a profitable busin ess, conside ring that <br>these costs have to be incurred.  <br>• Marketing costs, for exam ple sales promotion, advertising, sponsorships. People need to be made aware of <br>the new product or service entering the marketplace, in order to attract customers away from com peting <br>produ cts or services.  62 <br> 3.5.3 Return on investment  <br>Once the entrepreneur ha s determined what his total costs (investment) would be, he can then determine what <br>return he would get if he were to invest the same amount in a different venture. Each altern ate investment <br>places different demands on the entrepren eur’s time and effort, a nd exposes the entrepreneur to different levels <br>of risk. After conducting the financial analysis,  entrepreneurs should determine whether the return they expect <br>is adequate comp ensation for the time, effort and risk that they are con sidering undertaking.  <br>3.6 ORGANISATIONAL FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS  <br>An organisation has to be formed by the entrepreneur in order to exploit the idea and bring the idea to the <br>marketplace. After this, resou rces need to be acquired and allocated to the organisati on in order for it to op erate <br>effectively.  <br>Organisational feasibility is determined by evaluating management aspects (management prowess), <br>organisational structure as well as the non -financial resourc e requirements of the firm.  <br>3.6.1 Management aspects  <br>Management prowess includes  <br>• the passion of the entrepreneur or management team  <br>• knowledge and understanding of the market by the management team  <br>• the management team’s professional and social networks.  <br>Whe n entrepreneurs plan to start a new business, as part o f this organisational fea sibility, they should evaluate <br>the prowess, or ability, of the management team they plan to put together to make sure that the management <br>team has the requisite passion for the  business idea and relevant industry knowledge and expe rtise to launch <br>the ventu re. <br>Venture capitalists are more likely to invest in the team that seeks the financing than in the idea itself. The <br>passion of the entrepreneur would be the force that drives t he new business through stormy and turbulent <br>times. Lik ewise the expertise and s kill of the management team would be critical to ensure that the business <br>is able to respond to any challenges and changes in the market. If entrepreneurs wish to venture into an industry <br>that is unfamiliar to them, it would be wis e to partner with, or to acquire someone with knowledge of, and <br>networks in, the industry, as part of his management team. Entrepreneurs who wish to launch their own <br>business and have the knowledge and  expertise of the industry should consider the contribu tion and value that <br>any p otential partner brings to the business before deciding on whom to partner with.  <br>3.6.2 Organisational structure  <br>The entrepreneur needs to know how the business is going to oper ate. The organisational structure informs <br>entrepreneurs  of the number of staff m embers the organisation requires to generate sales and ensure that the <br>business operates effectively. This information is used to determine the costs relating to the appointmen t of <br>staff as part of the financial feasibility analysi s. <br>3.6.3 Resource suffici ency  <br>Resource sufficiency refers to the ability of the firm to obtain sufficient resources other than financial <br>resources. In a developing economy, the availability of some of the resources listed below might be difficult <br>to obtain, especially if the firm compe tes both locally and internationally. Non -financial resources include  <br>• affordable premises from which to run its office/lab/operations  63 <br> • ability to attract and employ skilled  employees  <br>• willingness of highly qualified employees to join the firm  <br>• available netwo rks and the likelihood of establishing favourable strategic partnerships  <br>• proximity to similar firms for the purpose of sharing knowledge  <br>• possibility of obtaining intellect ual property protection in key areas  <br>• proximity to key suppliers and customers.  <br>3.7 CO NCLUSION  <br>A feasibility analysis is a preliminary evaluation of a business idea. The feasibility analysis is conducted after <br>the entrepreneur has identified an opportunity and decided to explore the probability that the opportunity could <br>lead to a viab le bu siness. The feasibility analysis precedes the business plan and the business plan will only <br>be drafted once the entrepreneur is satisfied with the outcome of the feasibili ty analysis. The feasibility <br>analysis examines the product or service,  organisat ional , financial, technical and legal aspects, and the market <br>and industry feasibility of a business opportunity. Where the analysis indicates that the idea or opportunity is <br>not feasible, the entrepreneur can decide to amend the strategies he or she had i n min d when the feasibility <br>analysis was conducted. The feasibility analysis enables the entrepreneur to tweak the idea and make the <br>necessary changes in response to the feedba ck received before resources are committed to the exploitation of <br>opportunity. T he fe asibility study requires the budding entrepreneur to look at the following:  <br>• Aspects of the product or services to determine whether it is suitable for the consumer in the manner <br>intended or whether the planned product should be modified to appeal to t he ne eds of the consumer  <br>• Aspects of the market, such as the size of it and the potential market share the firm hopes to acquire.  <br>• The industry analysis looks at how attractive a nd profitable the industry is.  <br>• The financial feasibility analysis requires the e ntrep reneur to determine whether the product can be <br>introduced to the market at a competitive and attractive price to the consumer, and generate a <br>satisfactory profit.  <br>• The orga nisational feasibility analysis determines whether the business has sufficient m anage ment <br>expertise, organisational competence, and non -financial resources to successfully start the business.  <br>• The technical feasibility analysis examines aspects such as lega l and technical requirements, available natural <br>resources and infrastructure. Th is item of analysis is most relevant in a developing economy, as it is often <br>assumed that these aspects are present and considered not to be a challenge to a developed country.  <br>• By conducting a feasibility analysis, entrepreneurs can identify flaws in their  designs, assumptions about <br>consumers, etc., and make the necessary adjustments before going ahead to start a business.  <br>REVIEW QUESTIONS  <br>3.1 How would you classify the taxi ind ustry in terms of industry type?  <br>3.2 What are some of the technical feasibility challenges a student hoping to install coffee -vending machines in the hostels <br>and faculty buildings of a university might expect to face?  <br>3.3 What is a feasibility analysis and  what does it seek to accomplish?  <br>3.4 What are the criteria that you would use t o determine whether an industry is attractive?  <br>3.5 How would you go about determining whether an industry is profitable or not?  <br>3.6 Which aspects would one look at when conduct ing a market feasibility analysis?  64 <br> 3.7 What is an organisational feasibility ana lysis?  <br>3.8 Briefly describe elements of an organisational feasibility analysis.  <br>3.9 Discuss the various elements of a financial feasibility analysis.  <br>REFERENCES  <br>Barringer, B.R.  & Ireland, R.D. 2012.

This chapter contains some po inters regard ing essential success factors required by <br>entrepreneurs in an emerging market such as South Africa.  Section 4.2  highlights some uniqueness in <br>emerging market entrepreneurs hip and opportunities and challenges facing business in an emerging market <br>such as in South Africa. Thereafter, the subsequent sections of this chapter highl ight the impo rtance of learning <br>or possessing important success tools such as partnership, leadersh ip, innovation and planning.  <br>4.2 THE UNIQUENESS OF AN EMERGING MARKET FOR AN ENTREPRENEUR  <br>4.2.1 Untapped abundant resources  <br>Emerging markets such as South Af rica and othe rs draw their uniqueness from an apparently yet untapped <br>abundance of resources (human  and natural). In contrast, these opportunities can scarcely be found in <br>developed economies. Entrepreneurs in developed economies quickly realised that the developed mar kets are <br>heavily saturated with depleting resources and opportunities – a reason why e merging markets have become <br>a choice destination in recent years.  <br>4.2.2 Business value exists in low -income communities  <br>Firms that adopt entrepreneurship as a strategy of  growth have enormous value in emerging economies <br>(Pisano, Ireland, Hitt & Webb, 2007) . For instance, it is possible to fashion a profitable entrepreneurial venture <br>even in poor communities in emerging markets by moving away from the status qu o to apply mo dels that <br>uniquely address poor people’s needs and still provide financial gains for t he entrepreneur. A typical example 66 <br> of such a viable entrepreneurship strategy for emerging markets is the Base of the Pyramid (BOP) strategy <br>(Seelos & Mair, 2007). This i s unique to entrepreneurship in emerging economies, and may not easily fit into <br>the sa turated developed markets. Opportunities and new market niches are untapped and readily available with <br>even cheaper resources for the entrepreneurs. This mea ns that it is  much easier to develop and successfully <br>launch new brands into the emerging market as  many of the customers are less aware of existing diverse <br>brands (Roberts, Kayande & Srivastava, 2015).  <br>4.2.3 Government institutions offer opportunities  <br>There is also th e uniqueness stemming from opportunities offered by government institutions in emergin g <br>economies, which are investing in the underdeveloped markets with an emergence of the small middle class <br>with a taste for luxury goods. Entrepreneurs can t hus take this  opportunity and launch goods and services to <br>provide for such a middle class and make  financial gains to grow the entrepreneurship (see, for example, <br>Roberts et al., 2015).  <br>4.2.4 Competition among entrepreneurs  <br>Other dimensions of uniqueness include the c ompetition among emerging entrepreneurs that grabs market <br>segments for their brands. T his is because the awareness of opportunities is spreading globally and <br>international en trepreneurs are responding aggressively to take advantage. One might then wonder w hy the <br>rush to emerging markets, which includes even Africa – tagged previously as a “ hopeless continent” (The <br>Economist Intelligent Unit, 2012: 2). The United Nations Confer ence on Trade and Development estimates, <br>perhaps correctly, that, on a global comp arison, Africa provides one of the highest returns on foreign direct <br>investment – more  than other continents. While acknowledging the high return on investment in Africa, the  <br>UNCTAD indicates:  <br>Since 1990, the rate of return in Africa has averaged 29 per ce nt; since 1991, it has been higher than in any <br>other region, including developed count ries as a group, in many years by a factor of two or more (UNCTAD: <br>17). <br>4.2.5 Distinct p olitical institutional establishments  <br>Apart from the uniqueness embedded in the op portunities, resource abundance and mode of doing business, <br>emerging markets are also unique from developed markets from the context of their distinct political <br>institutional  establishments, economic development ideology and cultural norms (Alon & Rottig, 2013). <br>Therefore, potential entrepreneurs must be aware of these as they form part of the new learning that must be <br>embraced to navigate the new market terrain and take advan tage of the enormous opportunities. This genre of <br>distinctiveness in emerging mark ets might foster new thoughts and debates to innovate entrepreneurship <br>theories that h ave existed and guided enterprising strategies in the developed markets (Alon & Rottig, 2013). <br>Another unique aspect of emerging market entrepreneurship is the workforce category. While South Africa <br>has a youthful labour force with growing feminisation (Ca sale & Posel, 2002), China, on the other hand, has <br>an aging labour force (Alon & Rottig,  2013). These affect the distinctiveness of emerging market <br>entrepreneurship with respect to impacts on the human resource availability, quality and cost (Alon & Rottig , <br>2013). Given the uniqueness of human resources availability, labour tends to be more c ostly in China while <br>cheaper in South Africa.  67 <br> 4.3 OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN SOUTH AFRICA  <br>4.3.1 Expanding consumer market  <br>As an emerging market , the South African market has many opportunities amid few challenges. Given that <br>South Africa is the  one of  economic  giants of Africa, discussion of the opportunities an d challenges of <br>entrepreneurship here has a much broader tone, which also encompasses Africa. The middle class in South <br>Africa is increasing remarkably; this affords entrepreneurs the opportunity to provi de this market segment <br>with its concomitant quest fo r consumer products and services. Apart from the middle class opportunities, the <br>South  African market and Africa in general provides one of the biggest consumer markets in the world. Take, <br>for example, th e telecommunication business, which has proved how w ide the consumer market is in Africa. <br>Between 1999 and 2004 the use of the cell phone in Africa grew more than that in Asia at a rate of 58 per cent <br>per annum while the use of cell phone in Asia grew at a  much lower rate of 35 per cent per annum. Africa, <br>therefore, ranks as the second largest consumer of cell -phone services in the global co mmunity after China <br>(VenturesAfrica, 2016). Indeed, while almost half the African population live on a dollar a day, t he other half <br>are not necessarily poor. There is abu ndant growth in the middle class eager for new products and services. <br>This therefore p resents entrepreneurship opportunities from retail and/or services to small -scale <br>manufacturing. Even among the poor c ommunities, enterprising opportunities do exist, alt hough returns might <br>be comparatively low, but the “Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyrami d” theory does prove that the large number <br>of poor consumers will eventually contribute a large pool of profit to entr epreneurs who venture into the <br>bottom of the economi c pyramid (Africaopenforbusiness, 2016).  <br>4.3.2 Youthful demography of the African mark et <br>Another opportunity is the demography of the African market, which is highly populated, with an alluring mix <br>of you ng people below the age of 24, accounting for about half the population. This offers continuous <br>opportunities for enterprises to venture i nto goods and services channelled toward a youthful consumerist <br>appetite with its longevity propensity; age is very mu ch on the side of youthful African market. World <br>population forecasts indicate that by 2050, the population of Africa will increase to abo ut 2.4 billion ( The <br>Telegraph , 2016) with a possibility of African youths below 15 constituting half of its population  (The <br>Economist Intelligent Unit, 2012). This is an indication of a resilient entrepreneurship market opportunity now <br>and even into the ne ar future offering current and potential entrepreneurs the opportunity of long -term <br>investment founded on realistic pr ojected returns, since the future market is guarante ed. The youth market, <br>therefore, means the education industry and allied skills, as we ll as employment and diverse youthful <br>consumerism for goods and services will continue to bolster and sustain entrepre neurial returns. In addition, <br>Africa’s rate of urban isation is increasing tremendously, higher than in India, with about 40 per cent of Af rican <br>consumers living in urban areas – this is an opportunity for entrepreneurs to capture a cluster of target market s <br>as the demand for new goods and services by new ur ban arrivals increases (The Economist Intelligent Unit, <br>2012).  <br>4.3.3 Apparent risk wit h alluring returns  <br>While there is abundant enterprising opportunity in Africa, entrepreneurial business risk is still high. However, <br>expert opinion from top business exec utives is that the alleged risk of entrepreneurship in Africa is far greater <br>than the actual risk with potential for encouraging sustained returns after the waning of risks (St -Pierre & <br>Bahri, 2006; Afric aopenforbusiness, 2016). According to the The Econom ist Intelligent Unit.  <br>The key economic risks range from weak fiscal and monetary polic ies, high inflation, volatile currencies, high <br>taxes, nationalisation issues, skills shortages, inadequate infrastruct ure and red tape (Economist Intelligent <br>Unit, 2012: 7). <br>Inflation in Africa is high from a global lens comparison – especially within the commodity and product <br>markets. The inflation problem is and will continue to be compounded by power shortages, high ta xes and 68 <br> inadequate infrastructure for business. Alth ough South Africa is more developed than other African countries <br>with a comparatively better infrastructure, there are still sporadic power problems and an inadequate transport <br>system to support business (Economist Intelligent Unit, 2012). While big busine sses can survive transport and <br>power inadequacies, smaller businesses may not be able to, and generating their own electricity is expensive.  <br>4.3.4 Business climate  <br>As regards the climate for doing busine ss, Africa ranks very low when compared to other regi ons of the world <br>with regard to ease of doing business. The greatest of the problems i nclude irregular socioeconomic policies; <br>weak regulation of labour, which is often detrimental to the employers of la bour and deters young businesses <br>from early employmen t of labour; a shortage of critical skills; and corruption. Despite these inhibitors, South <br>Africa, Botswana and Mauritius are rated the best places to invest as they offer a relatively better environmen t <br>for business than other African countries (Economis t Intelligent Unit, 2012). However, this rating does not <br>dispel the aforementioned cha llenges.  <br>4.4 ENTREPRENEURIAL MANAGEMENT AND LEADERSHIP  <br>There have been a lot of discussions about exactly what constitutes skills that are essential for successful <br>entrep reneurship in any context. Several researchers have shown a myriad of skills, success factors and traits <br>that are essential for people who wa nt to enter into entrepreneurial ventures. Such skills include, but are not <br>limited to: creativity and innovation; motivation, with a high need for achievement; independence and <br>autonomy; as well as no t being afraid to take calculated risks (Caird, 2013). The personal traits include: <br>proactivity; high energy; self -confidence; high tolerance for ambiguity and/or uncerta inty; self -reliance, as <br>well as the ability to be a team player; determination, commit ment and the ability to persist against all odds; <br>and a  positive attitude. In addition to the traits mentioned for any business to prosper and be sustainable, <br>networking,  strategic thinking and management of risk, as well as basic management and leadership  skills are <br>crucial (Botha, 2014; Daft, 2014; European Union [EU] Skills Panorama, 2014; Venter, Urban & Rwigema, <br>2008).  <br>4.4.1 Management and leadership knowledge  <br>An idea l entrepreneurial venture starts with a good, viable idea and/or an opportunity that n eeds to be managed <br>well, in order for it to flourish an d be sustainable. Organisations, big or small, utilise financial, human, <br>technological and infrastructural/physical  resources to achieve goals of producing products or rendering <br>services. This manageme nt of resources is more challenging for small businesse s in emerging markets as the <br>resources are limited. Therefore, effective and efficient management of these scarce r esources becomes crucial <br>to achieve the entrepreneur’s vision. Management is a process  that entails planning, organising, leading and <br>coordin ating organisational resources to achieve organisational objectives.  <br>• Planning , which is the first step in the manag ement process, involves being able to scan the environment, <br>both internally and extern ally, to find out the strengths and weaknesses of the o rganisation, as well as the <br>opportunities and threats that are outside the organisation, which may facilitate or hi nder the prosperity <br>of the organisation. Being able to identify what opportunities the re are can help the entrepreneur <br>respond to customer ne eds and thereby build and maintain a competitive advantage. In addition, if <br>entrepreneurs are able to assess the th reats and opportunities, they are able to make <br>projections/forecasts in terms of busin ess prospects. Projections help in drafting informed bu siness plans <br>to help convince potential financiers in cases where finance is required. This points to the fact that  <br>entrepreneurs need, in line with strategic planning, to be able to draft clear and in formed business plans. <br>The end -product of planning is t o come up with the vision, mission, goals, and strategic and operational <br>plans for how the entrepreneurial venture is going to be executed.  69 <br> • Organising , the second phase of the management process, follo ws once the goals and plans of the <br>entrepreneurial vent ure have been outlined. This second step involves indicating how the available <br>resources are going to be allocated and utilised to achieve the set goals. For instance, organising involves <br>checking if m oney/finance, or properly qualified human resources are  available to be able to execute the <br>set plans effectively and efficiently. In addition, during organising, differe nt employees who have similar <br>skills and competencies can be grouped together to achie ve specific operational goals. These <br>categorisations of  people with similar skills and competencies show the levels of skill as well as reporting <br>structures, thereby resu lting in organisational  structures and hierarchies. The structures are also essential <br>for people to take responsibility and be accountable fo r the execution of plans and goals as set out during <br>the planning session. Having organisational structures is impo rtant for entrepreneurs to allocate/delegate <br>and monitor progress of duties that need to be performed. How well duties are performed is impor tant <br>for the prosperity of any organisation, as well as its competitive advantage. The organising function <br>includes  having policies and standards of operations on, for instance, recruitment and selecti on, <br>promotion, remuneration and labour relations, which  guide employees on what to do and how to do it. <br>Entrepreneurs need these guides that can help them in interactions  with all their stakeholders, existing <br>and potential.  <br>• Leading  involves influencing emp loyees towards achievement of the set goals. The leadin g role requires that <br>the entrepreneur communicates the vision of the business, as well as goals and plans to all th e employees <br>and other stakeholders in such a way that they will be motivated to achiev e those goals. Therefore, <br>interpersonal skills of commu nication and motivation of the self and others are very important in all <br>businesses, including small businesses.  <br>• The control  function is there mainly as a way of monitoring and evaluating progress in t erms of the <br>execution of plans as laid out, checking wh ere mistakes have been made and taking corrective measures <br>to remedy such mistakes. In start -up ventures especially  not everyone has the same understanding of the <br>business owner’s vision of the busines s. So by controlling all other employees, the small -business <br>manager or owner makes sure that all employees do what they are supposed to do.  <br>In addition to small -business  managers being able to apply the fundamental management principles as <br>indicated above , they should have the following skills:  <br>• Financial mana gement:  small -business owners/managers need to know what they can afford in terms of <br>resources such as equipment an d infrastructure, how much profit/loss they are making, and be able to <br>forecast the fu ture financial health of their business.  <br>• Managing peopl e and change management:  the ability to recruit the right people, train them and retain <br>them is crucial especially for small -business owners as they cannot afford frequent recruitment costs and <br>ad hoc training of new employees. Just like big businesses, sm all businesses operate in turbulent <br>environments. This turbulence is felt more in emerging markets as they are chal lenged by several factors <br>that include a lack of skills/expertise and resources. Conti nuous scanning of the environment is therefore <br>crucial so that the small -business owner can grab opportunities that present themselves while at the <br>same time respond to c ustomer needs, which are also frequently changing.  <br>• Marketing management:  entrepreneurs  need to keep in mind that attracting customers involve s a lot of <br>work and financial demands. Therefore it is important to do market research, which will inform the small -<br>business owner of whether or not there is a need for their business idea or not, as w ell as finding out <br>what the customers for that idea rea lly need. If effective marketing is not instituted, the survival of the <br>business may be seriously compromised.  <br>• Risk management:  risk is the likelihood that something untoward may happen in the course o f running a <br>business that can have a negative effect on  achieving the goals of that business. So possibilities of risk <br>need to be identified, analysed and managed wheneve r possible. According to a PricewaterhouseCoopers <br>(PwC) Report (2012: 7), “the balance  between risk and reward is the very essence of busines s: without <br>taking risks, companies cannot generate profits”. Thus businesses are often encouraged to take calculate d <br>risks.  <br>It is imperative for all organisations, small businesses included, to careful ly differentiate between calculated risks and entering <br>into reckless and irresponsible ventures. The type of risk an organisation faces depends on several factors, which include the <br>size of the business and its location. Small businesses are especially vul nerable to cash flow problems, which according to <br>the P wC Report (2012) are some of the major factors that have contributed to small -business failure.  70 <br> Additional factors that threaten the survival of small businesses, especially in emerging economies, are theft <br>and vandalism of equipment and/or property. Unfor tunately should these happen, many small businesses <br>struggle to recover as they have limited financial resources. T here are financial risks when venturing into <br>business, as well as reputational risks f or those stakeholders – people or organisations, invest ing in any new <br>venture, i.e. should anything go horribly wrong their reputation is at stake (Wickham, 2006). Other risks to <br>contend with include credit risk, the ever -evolving cyber risks, political ri sks, as well as environmental liability <br>risks. Therefor e it is crucial that all businesses, especially small businesses, develop risk -management <br>strategies. These risk -management strategies, if developed and managed effectively, help businesses to detect <br>potential threats and to devise plans for mitigation. Ef fective risk management can substantially reduce costs <br>and insurance premiums, which if not handled well, can drown  the small business.  <br>4.5 THE RESOURCE DEPENDENCY THEORY AND RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT  <br>An organisation is an open system. The operational activi ties that take place within any organisation are <br>dependent upon the inputs (that is, resources in the form of, for instance, raw materials, finance and competent <br>people) that are obtained from the exte rnal environment and the final products/services of the  organisation are <br>consumed/utilised by people/stakeholders external to the environment. This implies that the inter nal activities <br>of the organisation depend on the external environment, while the exter nal environment depends on the <br>organisation for product s and/or services. However, resources are limited, particularly in emerging economies. <br>There is constant competitio n for these resources. Small businesses have to compete with big and established <br>busin esses for these limited resources. This highlights the importance of the strategic management of <br>resources, especially for small businesses.  <br>The planning stage of managem ent (as explained above) requires that the manager of an organisation analyse <br>the inte rnal and external environments for availability of resources. Internal analysis entails looking at the <br>resources that the organisation posses ses, while external analysis checks the kind of resources that are <br>available that the organisation can utilise for its production or service rendering. Proper knowledge of the <br>internal and external circumstances, in terms of the resources that the organisa tion has or does not have is <br>essential for any organisation. This enables it to be able to take advantage of the re sources and/or opportunities <br>that are out there to eventually function effectively and efficiently and achieve its goals. According to the <br>resourcebased view “resources, organisational capabilities and competencies must be seen as the foundation <br>characteri stics that make up the competitive advantage of an organisation” (Ehlers & Lazenby, 2010: 114). <br>The resources that can help an organisation t o realise a competitive edge can be in terms of  assets  (tangible <br>and/or intangible) or organisational capabilities.  <br>• In terms of  tangible assets  organisations need to have a clear picture of their financial situation, the type of <br>materials, equipment, infra structure and/or technology t hey have that they can utilise to achieve a <br>competitive advantage.  <br>• Intangible assets/r esources  include the type of employees the organisations have employed, the image of <br>the organisation or reputation with customers. A negativ e/poor image or being perceiv ed negatively by <br>the customers can be damaging for an organisation if the organisation  is not aware and does not rectify <br>the poor perception.  <br>• Resources are not enough by themselves for an organisation to be competitive.  Organi sational capabilities , <br>in the form of processes, as well as talents, competencies and skills are essential to proces s the inputs <br>effectively and efficiently into products and/or services that are required by customers. The competency <br>and quality with which  these products and services a re processed/managed will assist in achieving a <br>competitive edge (Ehlers & Lazenby, 20 10; Myers, Hulks & Wiggins, 2012). Competencies develop over <br>time with experience, as well as education and training. Unfortunately most sma ll, medium and micro <br>enterpris es (SMMEs), especially in emerging economies, can often not afford to  employ experienc ed <br>personnel because firstly, they do not have the finance to afford the experience and secondly, emerging <br>economies often function in areas  that have scarce skills. Ther efore, it is important for managers/owners 71 <br> of SMMEs to try to maintain a balance betwe en their scarce resources (finance, for instance) with <br>procurement of yet another scarce resource (capabilities).  <br>One of the strategies that  SMMEs can use to access scarc e resources can be through the formation of <br>partnerships or collaborations that are es sential in improving their competitive edge.  <br>4.6 NETWORKING AND COLLABORATION/PARTNERSHIP ESSENTIALS  <br>For better prosperity, sustainability a nd to achieve a competitive ed ge, SMMEs need to network and form <br>partnerships and collaborations among themselves, a s well as with other stakeholders. Mullins (2010: 828) <br>defines network -building as a process that “involves individuals interacting with oth ers establishing a network <br>of co-operative relations. These networks are outside of the formal structure …” Collabor ations and networks <br>can help discover what is happening outside the day -to-day running of one’s business, identifying resources <br>and taking a dvantage of them, thereby bein g able to build a competitive edge. The importance of forming <br>networks can further be emphasised by the fact that “A leader or employee with many relationships knows <br>what’s going on in the organization and industry, whereas on e who has few interpersonal co nnections is often <br>in the dark about important activities or changes. … people with th e greatest power are those who cultivate <br>relationships with individuals at all levels, both in and outside the organization” (Daft, 2014: 43 6). In addition, <br>according to Hurry (2012: 4) “… by default (SMMEs) will collaborate because they themselves do not have <br>all the resources to engage in continuous innovation”.  <br>4.6.1 Motives for collaborations  <br>Following a review of the literature, Hurry (20 12: 83) compiled a list of com mon motives for collaboration <br>including the following:  <br>• Accessing technology  <br>• Accessing expertise  <br>• Building knowledge and learning  <br>• Accessing core competencies  <br>• Coordinating and speeding up the value chain in order to enjoy first -mover advantage  <br>• Colluding again st common rivals or reducing competition  <br>• Cost saving due to synergies via process rati onalisation and systems improvement, etc.  <br>• Economies of scale  <br>• Economies of scope  <br>• Increased flexibility, efficiencies and rewards  <br>• Inventory savings  <br>• Improvement of competiti on position  <br>• Improvement of quality  <br>• Reaching new markets/customers  <br>• Reducing transaction  costs/coordinating costs  <br>• Reducing risk and uncertainty  <br>• Sense of community and l egitimacy  <br>• Sharing R&D costs and legitimacy  <br>• Sharing resources/resource access  <br>4.6.2 Who to collaborate with  <br>Collaboration and networking opportunities can be with governmental o r non -governmental organisations <br>whose mandates include SMME support and develo pment; private businesses; or personal relationships with <br>other SMMEs, customers and/or sup pliers (Senik, Scott -Ladd, Entrekin & Adham, 2011). Thus, the <br>partnerships and collabo rations can take several forms as follows:  72 <br> • Firstly, networks with  bigger corpor ations  can afford the SMME managers/owners an opportunity to get <br>access to coaching and men toring by people who have more experience in running businesses in their <br>area of inter est and, importantly, in their geographic area.  <br>• Secondly, SMMEs can form networ ks and/or agreements with their  suppliers . This kind of agreement can <br>provide them an oppor tunity to negotiate for better deals and better prices; they can have some <br>influence o n the quantity of the materials and/or services they get from their suppliers, and should <br>situations call for it, they may be able to get materials quickly  (just -in-time) , which is something that can <br>be difficult to negotiate if there is no continuous rela tionship with the suppliers.  <br>• Thirdly, networks can be formed with  customers , both current and potential. The advantages of having a <br>relationship with customers include th e fact that:  <br>– It is easier to know the customer’s needs and whenever possible tailor -make products and services to suit <br>those customer’s needs;  <br>– Customer satisfact ion can be better monitored;  <br>– Frequent contact with a customer will likely promote custome r loyalty.  <br>– Customers can also include the  communities  within which businesses operat e. Usually they have <br>expectations in terms of social responsibility. Forming some form of relationship with them can assist <br>businesses to know what communities expect. Th is type of relationship can also promote support by the local <br>communities.  <br>• Fourthly, n etworking with  support and development initiatives  (from both the public and private sectors) <br>that are in place in South Africa would help the small business to know the type of services offered by <br>these organisations and thus  take advantage of the service s. Such services include, for instance, assistance <br>with the registration of their business; training in business skills; facilitating networks and collaborations <br>among va rious businesses through the databases that these organi sations have; and financial as sistance. <br>Forming close partnerships with such government organisations can help small businesses to know what <br>type of legislation there is in the country and what they n eed to do in order to be compliant.  <br>• Lastly, network with  peers, or similar small busin esses, as well as competitors to form collaborations in the <br>form of  strategic partnerships and alliances  that can help SMMEs achieve a competitive edge.  <br>Figure 4.1  illustrates the types of networks that businesses can form.  <br>From  Figure 4.1  it can be seen that there are various types of organisations and/or peo ple/stakeholders, with <br>which the small business can form networks and that these are also interconnected, dir ectly or indirectly. For <br>that reason, networking with the one can potentially result in relationships with the other(s).  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 73 <br> Figure 4.1 Networks that c an be formed  <br> <br> <br>Network s and collaborations can be in the form of social contacts. Social contacts,  according to Dani s, De <br>Clerq and Petricevic (2011) are: “… (people who an individual knows, or who are known by people the <br>individual knows) that an actor may leverage during the process of  establishing new business”. Danis et al. <br>(2011) found that these social networks ar e especially important in emerging markets as they help SMMEs in <br>getting access to the kind of knowledge needed to see new opportunities and know how to exploit t hose <br>opportunities. With modern technology and better access to such technol ogy, social networ ks are getting easier <br>to establish through social media, and small businesses should take advantage of the opportunity to network.  <br>Networking can also be enhanced  by attending business and entrepreneurial seminars (Danis, De Clerq & <br>Petri cevic, 2011), conf erences and/or exhibitions that are offered every now and then. Subscribing to <br>membership of business organisations is also an important consideration whenever po ssible. All these efforts <br>will go a long way to help small businesses to ide ntify relevant pla yers in their business industry, as well as <br>business opportunities, suppliers and customers.  <br>4.6.3 Formal collaborations  <br>More formal and/or strategic collaboratio ns can be in the form of joint ventures or strategic alliances. They <br>can be between small busi nesses themselves or the small business can try to partner with bigger businesses.  <br>• Joint ventures:  a joint venture is “a temporary partnership formed by two or mo re organisations for the <br>purpose of capitalising on a particular opportunity ” (Ehlers & Lazenb y, 2010: 211). Joint ventures are <br>especially attractive when the two businesses that are coming together have unique skills and/or <br>competencies that complement on e another. Usually businesses enter into joint ventures to learn unique <br>skills that the partne r has so they can improve their own skills, or take advantage of newer technologies, <br>or increase their ability to penetrate newer markets that they would not have  been able to access if they <br>were operating on their own. The ultimate goal of entering into a  joint venture is to enhance the <br>competitiveness of both businesses (Ehlers & Lazenby, 2010; Haberberg & Rieple, 2008). According to <br>Ehlers and Lazenby (2010: 212 ): “smaller organisations can increase their competitiveness by joining <br>forces against larger organisations”. In addition, small businesses in joint ventures can “… lower business <br>74 <br> risk by partnering with local entrepreneurs who have knowledge, contacts and  experience of the domestic <br>market” (Rwigema, 2006: 225).  <br>• Strategic alliance s: in strategic al liances, small businesses can enter into partnership agreements to share <br>knowledge, expertise and skills; share and reduce costs when dealing with suppliers or re duce costs in <br>terms of research and development; work together on the develo pment of new produ cts and <br>technologies; and share the benefits of new businesses while they each remain independent and do not <br>necessarily share ownership. Strategic alliances may be shorter term compared to joint ventures (Ehlers & <br>Lazenby, 2010; Elmuti &  Kathawala, 2001; Išoraite·, 2009; Rwigema, 2006). Išoraite· (2009: 39) defines a <br>strategic alliance as “an agreement between two or more organizations to cooperate in a specific b usiness <br>activity, so that each benefits from the strengths of the other, and  gains competitive  advantage”. More <br>and more companies are encouraged to enter into strategic alliances to enhance their ability to respond <br>effectively to globalisation as well as the ever -increasing uncertainty and turbulence of the business <br>environment. Strategic alliance s are especially good when small businesses want to grow by venturing <br>into new and unfamiliar markets while coping with the increasing costs that come with resear ch, <br>development and management of such growth (Ehlers & Lazenby, 2010; Rwige ma, 2006).  <br>Therefo re, it is important to realise that for small businesses to survive, they need to collaborate and form <br>partnerships with other small businesses, as well as with o ther stakeholders. However, management of these <br>partnerships is also crucial  for survival. Bef ore entering into any form of commitment it is important to <br>carefully assess the other partner in terms of whether the two companies are able to work together or not, then <br>jointly agree on the vision and purpose of the relationship, as we ll as on the roles  and responsibilities of both <br>partners and what resources (human resource skills, finance, technology, infrastructure) each partner brings <br>to the table. Misunders tandings, disagreements and/or conflicts between business partners can  event ually <br>cause more h arm to any small business than provide benefits, if not well managed. The harm can be <br>detrimental especially for a small business in an emerging market due to the  fact that resources, especially <br>financial, are already limited.  <br>As resource s are scarce espec ially for small businesses in emerging economies there is constant competition <br>for them. Companies therefore need to be able to negotiate access to these resource s as they are essential for <br>survival.  <br>4.7 NEGOTIATION SKILLS AND RELATIONSHI P MANAGEMENT  <br>In order to be competitive and sustainable, entrepreneurs in all organisations, especially small businesses from <br>emerging economies, need to learn negotiation skills t o gain access to scarce but vital resources. Negotiation <br>is unavoidable in a ll situations , personal or business. In the personal space one can negotiate with one’s spouse, <br>friend, child or parent. In the business environment negotiation can be with supplie rs, customers, business <br>partners or rivals or any other stakeholder. So nego tiation is in tegral to all collaborations and is necessary as <br>a business adaptive strategy “… since it is through this process that a common ground between actors is <br>identified, ne w understandings emerge, and joint or individual actions are decided upon” ( Hurry, 2012: 6). <br>Moreover, entrepreneurs who do not have negotiation skills will likely fail in issues of business sustainability <br>(Hurry, 2012). “Effective negotiation is the key t o the improvement of organizational effectiveness” (Chebet, <br>Rotich & Kurgat,  2015: 31).  <br>People negotiate because they want something that they value and quite often are willing to pay for it. When <br>managing a business, success and sustainable resources and competencies can be some of the things people <br>negotiate for. According to Ch ebet, Rotich and Kurgat (2015: 23), negotiation can be defined as the “process <br>of getting the best terms once the other side starts to act on their interest … The negotiating proce ss involves <br>balancing matters between two parties so that the negotiator not  only gets wh at he wants but also gets what he <br>wants in the best possible way”.  75 <br> According to Artinger, Vulkan and Shem -Tov (2013) effective entrepreneurial negotiating behaviour in cludes <br>being persuasive, expressive, adaptable, willing to bargain and to ac cept risk and  uncertain payoffs. In <br>addition, for the negotiation process to be effective Chebet, Rotich and Kurgat (2015) suggested that <br>negotiators need to do the following:  <br>• Prep are and plan thoroughly prior to entering the negotiation relationship so th ey have a cle ar idea of what <br>they would like to get or settle for from the negotiation.  <br>• Adopt a win -win situation; practise how to communicate competently, which can include learni ng the <br>language (verbal and nonverbal) of the negotiating partner.  <br>• Be willin g to ask ques tions and listen effectively, i.e. for verbal and non -verbal cues/information.  <br>• Maintain personal integrity while at the same time building strong relationships with ne gotiating partners.  <br>• Exercise patience.  <br>• Learn the culture of the negotiating partner and, as much as possible, be flexible and adaptable.  <br>According to Hurry (2012), the advantages of effective negotiation for businesses are countless. Entrepreneurs <br>can achi eve improved competitiveness by developing better strategies following what they get from  <br>negotiation, thereby improving their revenues. Through negotiation, entrepreneurs can strive to reduce costs, <br>resulting in greater efficiency in their operations. “Kn owing how to be influential can allow them to build new <br>businesses; gain acc ess to the be nefits of other firms’ assets, e.g. production capacity, technology, market <br>access, capital, products; to reach new markets quickly; and finally to fight against same competitors” (Hurry, <br>2012: 7). In addition, the negotiation process evolves thorough prep aration and planning, which helps the <br>negotiator access information about the strategic positions of both their organisation as well as that of their <br>negotiating partn er. This knowledge can enhance their strategic position, thereby enabling th e organisatio n to <br>adapt well to fluctuating economic and market conditions.  <br>Building a relationship with stakeholders is crucial to achieve competitiveness. Retaining that relation ship is <br>just as important. So managing  any relationship is important from th e onset. Thi s management of a business <br>relationship starts with selecting a partner that the business is likely to have a long -term relationship with. <br>This means that partners shou ld have  <br>• shared business values and ethics  <br>• a common understanding of the visi on and objec tives of the partnership  <br>• commitment to the objectives of the partnership  <br>• trust for one another.  <br>Constant monitoring of how the partnership is unfolding and working is n ecessary, as is continuous <br>communication of future needs. Feedback can help in retaining  and strengthening most relationships. Should <br>any relationship not work out as initially envisioned, it is always advisable for partners to talk about their <br>relationshi p and part ways amicably so that they leave room for future collaborations.  <br>4.8 CONCLUSI ON <br>The South African entrepreneurial landscape, like most circumstances in emerging markets is faced with <br>challenges, which can have negative effects on the success of small businesses. These negative effects are a <br>matter for concern as they ha mper economi c growth and development. Although there are a lot of <br>opportunities for new businesses in South Africa, taking advantage of those opportunities is hampered by a <br>pervasi ve lack of resources. Therefore to be able to thrive in underresourced emerg ing markets,  entrepreneurs <br>need to engage in several strategies that include partnerships/collaborations. Entrepreneurs also need to <br>negotiate to get the right resources for their business visions. In addition, entrepreneurs need to be innovative. <br>Technolo gical advanc ements present an opportunity for new businesses and/or potential to grow current <br>businesses. So there are a lot of considerations that small -business owners within eme rging markets should <br>consider and can take cognisance of for them to thrive and achieve a competitive edge.  76 <br> REVIEW QUESTIONS  <br>4.1 Discuss the types of partnerships and/or collaborations that small businesses can form.  <br>4.2 What are the benefits of a business  entering into a collaborative relationship with its suppliers?  <br>4.3 What are  some of the steps that business negotiators can follow in order for the negotiation process to be effective?  <br>REFERENCES  <br>Africaopenforbusiness. 2016.

Small businesses <br>play a significant role in creating employment opportunities and compared to large companies, they e mploy <br>more women, young people and part -time employees. They are als o closely connected with the region in <br>which they operate and therefore have significant influence on the region’s development. Van Scheers (2011) <br>observes that the small -business se ctor c omprises over 90 per cent of South African business operations, <br>contributes over 50 per cent towards gross domestic product (GDP), and employs over 50 per cent of the <br>workforce. The small -business sector has shown some positive signs in South Africa,  Mauri tius and North <br>Africa, and Van Scheers (2011) states that small busi nesses constitute 55 per cent of all jobs provided. <br>Research by Bowler, Dawood and Page (2007) revealed that 40 per cent of new business ventures fail in their <br>first year, 60 per cen t  in their second year, and 90 per cent in their first 10 years of existe nce. All these facts <br>illustrate the importance of the small -business sector as well as the difficulty in starting a small business in <br>emerging economies. Therefore, although starting  a new  small business can lead to personal and financial <br>rewards in the fu ture, the small -business owner will face a number of challenges when starting out. General, <br>financial, managerial skills, marketing skills challenges and challenges evaluating new bu siness  opportunities <br>were outlined in  Chapter 4 . The following general challenges for a start -up bu siness in developing economies <br>have been identified and will be disc ussed next.  <br>5.2 GENERAL CHALLENGES FOR STARTING A BUSINESS IN A DEVELOPING ECONOMY  <br>Kanchana, Divya and Beegom (2013) note that challenges faced by all new small businesses,  regardles s of <br>which economy they start the business in are the following: overestim ating success; misplaced purpose; <br>negative mindset; poor organization; Jack of all trades; employee motivation; and lack of family support. 80 <br> However, in emerging economies the list is  much longer, because these economies bring with them more <br>challenges as t o what business start -ups in developed economies experience. It is a fact that emer ging <br>economies usually present viable business opportunities to small businesses since they have la rge consumer <br>populations with new consumer needs or wants. Unfortunately, emerging economies also bring different <br>challenges for small -business startups, suc h as: challenges inhibiting small -business growth; globalisation; <br>poor infrastructure; product or s ervice demand challenges; limited protection from corruption; cultural ris ks; <br>issues finding qualified staff; and crime.  <br>5.2.1 Challenges inhibiting small -business growth  <br>Despite the importance of small businesses and their contribution to the economic gro wth of South Africa, <br>they still face numerous challenges that inhibit grow th as observed by Hussaina, Si & Wang (2013). Apart <br>from funding and limited access  to finance, the  Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Report  (GEM, 2012) noted <br>that South Africa’s small  businesses also suffer from poor management and marketing skills. South A frica has <br>one of the highest small -business failure rates in the world due to these  factors (Strydom, 2013: 2863 –2871). <br>Dockel and Ligthelm (2012) emphasise that marketing decisions are essential to small businesses if they want <br>to succeed. Successful mark eting will generate crucial sales but unfortunately, marketing expenditure makes <br>up only a small portion of their budget. Chimucheka and Rungani (2011) argue that the probability of a new <br>small business surviving beyond 42 months and becoming an establishe d business is less likely in South Africa <br>than in any other Global Entrepreneurship  Monitor participating countries. These arguments illustrate how <br>difficult it is to start a busines s in emerging economies.  <br>The challenges facing entrepreneurs and small bus iness in Africa are varied and many. Lack of financial <br>support, weak economic infra structure, and lack of policy coherence for small -business support need to be <br>addressed quickly if small firms are not to fall far behind their counterparts in other parts o f the world. Given <br>the small number of indigenous African small businesses compared  to businesses from other parts of the <br>world, education and training support will help establish a good foundation for small -business growth (Abor <br>& Quartey, 2010). Students  in universities and technical schools should be encouraged to become <br>entrepreneurs  because of their potential to explore non -traditional small -business models.  <br>5.2.2 Globalisation o f markets and production globalisation challenges  <br>Globalisation of markets  may assist small businesses that have challenges with limited market access to <br>expand their businesses. Globalisation of markets refers to a fundamental shift in the world economy i n which <br>nations are moving toward an interdependent global economic system  (Hamisi, 2011). Globalisation has <br>resulted in previously historically separate mar kets having become one huge global marketplace as a result of <br>reductions in trade barriers and adva nces in information and transportation technologies. As a result, the smal l <br>business can now participate in international trade right from inception.  <br>Another  facet of globalisation is globalisation of production. Companies can locate production facilities in <br>countries where labour and other production inputs are cheaper. The end  result is that globalisation presents <br>new threats for small business in Africa in the form of increased competition from foreign entrants. Locally <br>manufactured goods now compete wit h cheaper, good quality products from other emerging economies, such <br>as Ch ina, India and Brazil. These inexpensive imports are rapidly replacing locally made  goods and shutting <br>down small -scale manufacturers.  <br>5.2.3 Poor infrastructure challenges  <br>Basic phys ical infrastructure required for economic development, such as good roads,  ample power supply, <br>and good rail and river transportation facilities, are in ver y poor shape in most African countries. A study <br>conducted in Tanzania by Hamisi (2011) observes that  deplorable roads, deteriorating rail lines, inadequate <br>power  supply and u nusable waterways (Gordin, 2011) have combined to make small -business operations <br>difficult. Mambula (2013) indicates that damage to equipment because of power surges and down time du e to <br>unavailability of electric power during production hours are major pr oblems for small manufacturers in some 81 <br> African countries. To overcome this problem , entrepreneurs need to pay for their own private generators to <br>power their manufacturing operations , thus their production costs are increased and their products become <br>less competitive.  <br>In addition to the problems noted above, the information and communi cation infrastructure in most African <br>countries is weak. Access to information infrastructure is con sidered an indispensable condition for <br>widespread socioeconomic developmen t in this age of globalisation and in the information economy (Gordin, <br>2011). The result of poor communication networks in most African countries is the low level of internet usage. <br>Also, Africa has low telephone penetration, and inadequate broadcasting fa cilities, computing infrastructure <br>and other consumer electronics. Although these are general shortcomings for African countries, it should be <br>noted that African countries exhibit di ffering levels of information infrastructure, with North African countries  <br>and South Africa at a higher level of information technology preparedness than mo st African countries. Power -<br>supply problems are the leading challenge in most African countries.  <br>5.2.4 Limited protection from corruption challenges  <br>Gordin (2011) discusses p roblems that many US companies face in emerging markets because of limited <br>protect ion from corruption. Emerging countries often have less evolved legal and ethical protections, forci ng <br>businesses to risk encounters with criminals or crooked law enforcement  agents. Stealing or unscrupulous <br>business transactions are common, but violence a nd even murder can happen in some countries.  <br>5.2.5 Cultural risks  <br>A disadvantage of trying to do bus iness in emerging economies is the challenge in overcoming cultural risks.  <br>Cultural perspectives, rituals and product usage vary around the world and when n ew economies emerge, they <br>may have different expectations than ones in which a business is establish ed. An American small business for <br>instance, may struggle with understandi ng how to do business in China, Brazil, or South Africa because of <br>cultural challe nges.  <br>5.2.6 Challenges in recruiting qualified staff  <br>In emerging economies it is difficult to find e mployees with the proper skills for the small business. Employees <br>need to understand the vision of the small business and should be committed to making it a success. Finding <br>employees who can be trusted with t he valuable task of creating a successful busin ess is difficult. The small -<br>business owner needs to take extra care when h iring and carefully evaluate potential employees. Employed <br>staff should be provided with strong guidance and mentorship so that they fe el empowered to perform their <br>roles effectively . A good strategy for the small business is to create a solid and comprehe nsive human <br>resources policy so that problems can be managed if they do arise.  <br>5.2.7 Crime  <br>The World Bank’s Investment Climate Report ( 2005) rated crime as one of the four major cons traints on <br>small -business growth. About 30 per cent of small businesses su rveyed for the World Bank study (2005) <br>indicated that crime was a major problem. A study conducted by Van Scheers (2011) rates crime am ong the <br>top four constraints of operating a sma ll business.  <br>Viswanathan (http://www.quora.com , 2016) gives a summary of typical challenges faced by business start -ups in developing <br>countries:  <br>• Unfavourable g overnment regulations  <br>• Poor implementation of re gulations and laws (weak judicial system/corruption)  <br>• No proximity to other  successful ventures  <br>• Unavailability of talented human resources  <br>• Poor communications and technological infrastructure  <br>• Cultural issues di ssuading individuals from entrepreneurship  <br>• No social support from the government in case of failure  82 <br> • Poor linkages and ava ilability of quality educational institutions  <br>• Financial institutions not keen on supporting technology -related ventures  <br>• Expensive real estate and frauds  <br>5.3 FINANCIAL CHALLENGES FOR STARTING A SMALL BUSINESS IN A DEVELOPING <br>ECONOMY  <br>The Economic Development  Department (http://www.economic.gov.za , 2014) focuses on the challenges <br>faced by South African small business, noting that th e main and common problem remains access to finance. <br>Access to capital; fi nancial -support challenges as well as financial assistance available for small business in <br>South Africa, and government -initiated financial options to support small business will be discussed next.  <br>5.3.1 Access to capital  <br>Access to new capital is what driv es many small businesses to take on the risks of doing business in emerging <br>markets. As new eco nomies emerge, untapped capital is up for grabs and building and maintaining a pipeline  <br>to those funds helps companies not only expand abroad, but also bring in new resources for domestic growth. <br>Emerging market capital can breathe new life into companies that have maxed out potential for new capital <br>domestically. Small businesses may have o pportunities to grow in emerging markets not available to them in <br>domestic  markets.  <br>5.3.2 Financial -support challenges  <br>Despite existing policies on financial support for small businesses, very few entrepreneurs receive financial <br>help when they need it. For  example, Neneh (2011) observes that 72 per cent of the entrepreneurs he s tudied <br>in Nigeria considered lack of financia l support as the number one constraint in developing their business. <br>According to Terblanche, Moeng and Macleod (2011), small businesses consider procedures for securing <br>business loans from banks cumbersome and the collateral demanded for such loans excess ive. Banks, on the <br>other hand, defend their behaviour by noting that most small businesses that apply for a loan do not present <br>an accept able feasibility study or a good business plan. Furthermore, many small -business owners do not even <br>have a deposit acco unt in a bank, a condition for advancing a loan to an applicant. To complicate the problem, <br>there is no law to protect a bank against a l oan default. Banks, as Hussaina, Si and Wang (2013) state, also <br>point out that entrepreneurs are unwilling to acquire f ormal training in how to run a business. Although in <br>some African countries banks are by law required to set aside a certain percentage o f their profits for small -<br>business loans, many banks would rather pay a fi ne than make what they believe to be a high -risk loan.  <br>5.3.2.1 Financial assistance available for small businesses in South Africa  <br>The following financial institutions in South Afric a will consider lending money to small -business owners in <br>assisting busine ss start -ups as well as for expanding existin g businesses.  <br>ABSA Bank  <br>ABSA bank has for a long time been active in financing small enterprises. There is an ABSA division called <br>New En terprise Banking (NEB), which deals with entrepreneurs who do not have eno ugh collateral for normal <br>business loans and who require Khula credit guarantees. Unfortunately, the criteria for this loan are a 100 per <br>cent BEE ownership and full -time involvement  in the business. Small businesses do not qualify for traditional <br>bank cre dit due to a lack of a credit rating, securit y or their own capital. They also have to bank only at ABSA <br>(http://www.entr epreneurmag.co.za ). Absa has dedicated banking products such as special c ards and accounts <br>for business owners.  83 <br> First  National Bank (FNB)  <br>FNB has made substantial progress towards recognising the importance of small businesses  and has started <br>taking small -business development seriously. It has launched the Progress Fund, which is an equity investment <br>scheme aimed at busi nesses owned by black entrepreneurs who are younger than 35 <br>(http://www.so wetanlive.co.za/sowetan ). The age limit is a criterion because the fundin g for the Progress Fund <br>is assisted by the N ational Youth Development Agency, which has very strict requirements and generally <br>disqualifies most entrepreneurs. Although evidence all over the world has clearly shown that serious <br>entrepreneurship usually sta rts after 30, most financial institutions te nd to favour younger entrepreneurs (Von <br>Broembsen, Wood & Herrington, 2013).  <br>People’s Bank  <br>This bank is a subsidiary of Nedcor and holds N edbank’s old Nedenterprise unit, which deals with small -<br>business finance ( Pakisha, 2013). To date, the unit’s impact h as been slow, including its use of Khula <br>enterprise guaranteed loans. But there is hope yet, because the bank has been said to be assistin g small <br>businesses that have won tenders by supplying bridging financing t o them.  <br>Standard Bank  <br>Standard bank has been  at the forefront of small -business support and was the first bank to offer small -business <br>banking in South Africa (http://www.standardbank.co.za ). For m any years they have had a small -business <br>division as well as small -business accounts and cards. They also introduced other services to small businesses <br>like bulk cash deposit machine s, for small -business owners who cannot go into the bank during normal <br>banking hours to deposit the cash. Standard Ban k has the best developed infrastructure for dealing with small -<br>business owners but unfortunately they are no longer part of the SEDA and S EFA schemes (see page  56), so <br>the chances of getting a loan without collate ral are now extremely slim.  <br>Business start -ups can qualify for a BizLaunch  account. A BizLaunch account will assist sm all-business <br>owners to keep accurate banking records. It will also produce statements for easy reference and assist in <br>building up a banki ng relationship and credit -risk profile.  <br>A recent initiative, which shows that Standard Bank remains in touch with the  needs of small businesses, is <br>their new transaction account for blacklisted business owners (http://www.pixel pusher.co.za/tag/standard -<br>bank -personal -loans-blacklisted/ ). At most South African banks it is almost impossible to open even a savings <br>account if you are blacklisted. Macleod, Moen g and Terblanche (2013) mention that Standard Bank’s new <br>account for black listed business owners is opened without ove rdrafts, which assist small businesses to conduct <br>business and rehabilitate their financial record.  <br>5.3.2.2 Stokvels and micro -finance ins titutions  <br>Small entrepreneurs in black communities in South Africa can bor row money from microfinance institutions <br>such as stokvels . As a way of saving money, a group of people, who contribute an amount of money every <br>month, form a money  stokvel . Each memb er then receives the total amount saved once or twice a year, <br>depending on  how many members the  stokvel  has. The membe rs may also borrow money from <br>the stokvel  without paying interest. This type of micro -finance assists SMEs to survive and expand their <br>businesses.  <br>5.3.3 Government financial initiatives to support small businesse s <br>Most governments have a policy towards enc ouraging the growth and development of small businesses, for <br>obvious reasons. The motivation behind government’s initiative in European co untries is driven by the belief <br>that the small business is handicapped by type of business and location. European coun tries state that the <br>market mechanism has failed to address the capital needs of small businesses in emerging economies. The <br>landscape of government funding initiatives directed at the small -business community is  a complex one and <br>subject to the political situation prevalent at the time. Different governments have a variety of complexities 84 <br> and usually the most developed countries differ in t heir emphasis, targeting, commitment and approach to <br>financing small -busin ess start -ups. <br>Most governments have tried to stimulate and encourage small businesses and enterprise development by <br>creating and supporting financing schemes that should alleviate t he present market deficiencies. In the United <br>Kingdom (UK) as well  as in m uch of the Euro pean Union (EU), funding initiatives have been created and <br>introduced to provide for both equity and debt finance. The Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme was <br>introduced  in 1981 to address the perceived gap in the provision of loan finance for  small enterpri ses. This <br>involves the government underwriting or guaranteeing a percentage (75 –85 per cent) of the loan made to a <br>small firm by a bank to fund a viable project, which  would otherwise not normally qualify for debt finance on <br>commercial terms . Another UK go vernment initiative was introduced in 1994 and caters for the lack of <br>appropriate equity finance. The Business Expansion Scheme (http://www.financial -dictionary.com ) provided <br>tax advantages for individuals to invest in qualified unquoted companies. It was designed to stimulate small <br>equity investments in businesses seeking to expand but, in reality, became  a vehicle for tax avoidance for the <br>wealthy. As Storey (2011)  notes, it i s highly questionable that it came anywhere near to achieving its <br>objectives of injecting equity into those small businesses. Mason and Harrison (2013) suggest that there were <br>indeed  a number of very real benefits to the scheme, such as raising  the profile  of the small enterprise as <br>representing the appropriate investment vehicle for private investors.  <br>In South Africa, the Small Enterprise Development Agency (SEDA) was established in December 2004 as an <br>agency under the Department of Trade and I ndustry (the  DTI). The establishment was done by merging three <br>organisations, namely the Ntsika Enterprise Promotion Agency, National Manufacturing Advisory Centre <br>(NAMAC) and Community Public P rivate Partnership Programme (CPPP). The GODISA Trust and Nati onal <br>Technol ogy Transfer Centre were integrated into SEDA in April 2006, becoming the SEDA Technology <br>Programme (STP) (http://www.thedti.gov.za/agencies/seda.jsp ). SEDA provides busines s developmen t and <br>support services for small enterprises through its national network, in partnership with other role players. It <br>also implements programmes targeted at business development in a reas prioritised by the government.  <br>The Small Enterprise Finan ce Agency (S EFA) was established in 2012 as a result of the merger of South <br>African Micro Apex Fund, Khula Enterprise Finance Ltd and the small -business activities of IDC. SEFA’s <br>mandate is to f oster the development, survival and growth of small business i n South Afri ca and to contribute <br>towards poverty alleviation and job creation. SEFA has a regional footprint of nine offices around the country.  <br>SEFA focuses on small -business challenges such as  weak small -business performance, duplication of services <br>amon g government  agencies and the high cost of delivering financial services to small business. Its mission <br>and vision are to offer a range of finance from loans of R500 up to R5 million. It provide s finance directly to <br>small business that could not access pri vate-sector funding, through more simple procedures and it aimed to <br>improve its processing times and pricing of products. It introduced a Co -Operatives Support Programme, and <br>had a set target fo r numbers to be supported, and the values. Of the funding disb ursed, 30 pe r cent was targeted <br>towards youth -owned enterprises, 45 per cent towards priority rural provinces, 40 per cent of funding towards <br>women -owned businesses, progressively increasing in subsequent years, and 70 per cent towards black -owned <br>business es (http://www.pmg.org.za ). <br>5.4 MANAGERIAL SKILLS CHALLENGES FOR STARTING A SMALL BUSINESS IN A <br>DEVELOPING ECONOMY  <br>Managerial skills are requir ed to manage a small business and in an emerging economy many  small -busine ss <br>owners lack managerial skills because they have never received managerial training. These small -business <br>owners need to survive after losing their jobs. They become small -business  owners because the formal system <br>does not create formal work  opportunitie s. Examples of managerial skills are the following: managing <br>personal stress; managing time; doing performance appraisals; motivating people; managing conflict; solving 85 <br> problems; mar keting; book -keeping; record keeping; writing business plans;  and pricing.  Managerial skills <br>could be sorted into four main groups. The first group focuses on participation and human relations skills, e.g. <br>constructive communication and team building, whil e the second group focuses on competitiveness and <br>control, e. g. assertiven ess, power and influence skills. A third group focuses on innovativeness and <br>entrepreneurship, such as creative problem solving, while a fourth group focuses on  maintaining order and  <br>rationality, e.g. managing time and rational decision making . Managers re quire certain managerial skills to <br>manage a business successfully, namely technical, conceptual, interpersonal, communication, analytical, <br>decision -making, administrative and problem -solving skills. Technical skills; conceptual skills; interpe rsonal <br>skills ; communication skills; decision -making skills; analytical skills; administrative skills and problem -<br>solving skills are the different types of skills that will be highlighted next.  <br>5.4.1 Technical skills  <br>Technical skill is the ability to perfo rm a speciali sed task that involves certain methods or processes (Pearce <br>& Robinson, 2010). Most people develop a set of technical skills to complete activities that are part of their <br>daily work lives. For example, the accountant will develop the basic ski lls needed to  conduct an audit while <br>marketers may know pricing, market research and sales concepts. It is apparent that managers rely less on <br>their basic technical skills as they advance to high er levels of management but these basic skills supplied the <br>background to manage their businesses (Bateman & Snell, 2011). Managers on the operational level of <br>management in an organisation, for example, use more production skills and need a higher degree of technical <br>skill.  <br>5.4.2 Conceptual skills  <br>These involve the  manager’s ab ility to adopt the perspective of the organisation as a whole to see the big <br>picture. The manager with a high level of conceptual skill is able to plan achievable goals and arching <br>strategies for the organisation. When greater responsibility i s required, c onceptual and decision -making skills <br>are used with increasing frequency. As managers advance to higher management levels in an organisation, <br>they exercise their conceptual and decisi on-making skills with increasing frequency (Bowler, Dawood & Page, <br>2007).  <br>5.4.3 Interpersonal skills  <br>Interpersonal communication is an interactive process between individuals that involves sending and receiving <br>verbal and non -verbal messages. Effective com munication between individuals, especially between a manager <br>and subordina te, is critical to achieving organisational objectives (Rue, Byars & Nabil Ibrahim, 2014). <br>Interpersonal skills influence the manager’s ability to work with people. It involves manag erial ability to deal <br>effectively with employees. This skill is acknowledg ed as a key to a small business’s future. Small -business <br>owners spend half of their working day in interaction with other people. In many organisations, the reason a <br>small business f ails is not because of technical skills, but lack of interper sonal skills.  <br>5.4.4 Communication skills  <br>The key to any successful small business is its communications. It involves the small -business owners’ ability <br>to transmit their ideas and preferences to others in both oral and written forms. Without communication skills, <br>the small business will not be successful. Skills in communicating effectively in meetings, through letters and <br>memoranda are consistently important throughout their careers (Pearce & Rob inson, 2010). Small -business <br>owners must develop their abilit ies to lead, motivate and communicate effectively with those around them. <br>Every function of small -business management (planning, organising, leading and controlling) requires <br>effective communicat ion skills.  86 <br> 5.4.5 Decision -making skills  <br>Decision -making skil ls involve th e small -business owner’s ability to choose an appropriate course of action <br>from two or more alternatives. Subordinates perform the task directly required for production, but the owne r <br>must still decide what strategy to implement, what resource s are acquire d and how they are to be allocated <br>(Terblanche, Moeng & Macleod, 2011). Small -business owners use these skills when they consider the overall <br>objectives and strategy of the business,  the interactions among different parts of business, and the role of the <br>business in its external environment. The key to decision making is the ability to select the appropriate <br>decision -making style for each decision faced. Successful small -business owne rs learn to match the <br>appropriate decision -making style with the situation . <br>5.4.6 Analytical skills  <br>Analytical skills show an ability to properly use scientific and quantitative approaches, techniques and tools <br>to solve management problems. Small -business owners need to diagnose problems and identify alternative <br>solutions before  selecting and implementing a corrective plan of action. This is the primary indication of the <br>level of their analytical skills.  <br>5.4.7 Administrative skills  <br>Administrative skills are  the ability of small -business owners to execute business rules, regulatio ns, policies <br>and procedures to operate effectively within budgetary constraints. It also involves coordinating information <br>flow in the business.  <br>5.4.8 Proble m-solving skills  <br>Problem solving is the process of determining the appropriate response or action n ecessary to alleviate a <br>problem. Small -business owners need to have the ability to sort out the issues being discussed and to recognise <br>which business issues  are crucial. Successful small -business owners will contribute to sustainable <br>development in South Africa.  <br>Next, marketing skills challenges will be outlined.  <br>5.5 MARKETING SKILLS CHALLENGES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES IN A DEVELOPING <br>ECONOMY  <br>The American Market ing Association (2006) sug gests that marketing is “the process of planning and <br>executing the pricing , promotion, and distribution of goods, ideas, and services to create exchanges that satisfy <br>individual and organizational goals”. Marketing begins with a n eed which must be satisfie d by the selling of <br>a specific product or the rendering of a service to a consumer. In developed economies such as Ireland, Hills <br>(2001) observes that small businesses engage in fairly sophisticated marketing planning with many co mmitted <br>to three -year mark eting plans and reviewing their plans annually. In contrast in South Afric a, Van Scheers <br>(2010) indicates that a lack of marketing skills has a negative impact on the success of small businesses and <br>contributes to their high failu re rate. Strydom (2013) st ates that small -business owners exhibit certain <br>personality traits that ar e responsible for the success or failure of their businesses. Inadequate marketing skills <br>of small -business owners create marketing problems in South Africa . Some of the marketing sk ills challenges <br>have been addressed in the various studies on small busine ss. These relate to the following:  <br>• Gaining an understanding of the market and potential for growth  <br>• Market segmentation  <br>• Market needs analysis  <br>• Competitiveness  87 <br> • Marketing of products and  services  <br>The small -business owner also needs to constantly study the macr o environment; seek attractive opportunities, <br>and plan new strategies. The business has to offer the product to consumers to make them aware that the <br>produc t can satisfy their needs.  To make this offer, the small -business owner has to make a decision about  the <br>following four factors:  <br>• What will the product consist of? (Product)  <br>• Where will it be purchased? (Distribution)  <br>• How should it be promoted? (Marketing co mmunication)  <br>• How much will  it cost? (Price)  <br>Small businesses in South Africa experience the followin g marketing -skills challenges:  <br>• Social -media platforms  <br>• Building customer loyalty  <br>• Low demand for products  <br>• Poor locality of the small business  <br>• Ineffective marketing of products and lack  of market knowledge  <br>• Products pricing  <br>5.5.1 Social -media platforms  <br>Small -business owners experience challenges in choosing the correct social -media platforms to promote their <br>businesses. Social -media platforms can be used for different marketing activities . Using social networks can <br>make the small business more visible. Engaging  with customers online can raise awareness of product range <br>and build the business’s reputation as a tru sted supplier.  <br>Social networking can improve a business in a number of key are as: <br>• Marketing of products or services  <br>• Brand building  <br>• Customer interaction  <br>5.5.2 Building customer loyalty  <br>Small -business owners experience challenges when trying to build custome r loyalty. The ability of a small <br>business to not only attract, but retain cus tomers can make the difference between success and failure. <br>Regularly deli vering a high -quality product or service is important but in an increasingly competitive <br>environment the  small business cannot rely on that alone to retain a customer base. The small -business owner <br>needs to conduct constant research to establish its custom er base and its accompanying needs. Innovative <br>rewards programmes, added convenience in the form of home  deliveries or extended hours, or comprehensive <br>aftersales service can assist the small -business owner in retaining customers.  <br>5.5.3 Low product demand  <br>Strydom (2013) observes that ensuring that consumer demand matches product supply is one of the primary  <br>tasks of a small business. Consumers expect high product availability and low prices and small businesses in <br>return tend to focus more on increasing pro duct variety and expanding logistical activities. The level of <br>products demanded from a small business is a further function of many different factors. Pakisha (2013) <br>suggests that t he small business is experiencing demographic changes in South Africa, whi ch could result in <br>too small a population to support the small business in a specific region. The commu nity could also experience <br>social change, which could further affect the needs of consumers and result in increased competition from <br>other small business es in the region. Other important marketing challenges small businesses are exposed to <br>include increase d traffic congestion, parking restrictions in urban areas and rising petrol pri ces affecting <br>customer’s willingness to travel to them.  88 <br> Chiliya, Herbst an d Roberts -Lombard (2009) support this view and explain that the trading environment in <br>South Africa has  changed to a great extent in the last few years. Significant developments have  occurred in <br>the economic and social environment, which has affected the a bility, perception and behaviour of consumers <br>regarding shopping and retailing. Consumers have differen t needs and desires and their consumption patterns <br>vary considerably. There is a likelihood that smaller small businesses are less able to satisfy the de mands of <br>the modern customer than larger retail stores.  <br>5.5.4 Poor locality  <br>Strydom (2013) explains that the choice of a small -business selection is influenced by its location. Custo mers <br>are more likely to select a small business while considering a number  of shopping activities that they must <br>execute. For example, they might purc hase a product at a small business only because it is close to another <br>one they planned to visit and not b ecause of its attractive characteristics. The proximity of other small <br>businesses can therefore be regarded as an important determinant of store choic e. <br>Levy and Weitz (2012: 218 –220) highlight a number of additional factors that small businesses should <br>consider when determining location. For example, the small -business owner wo uld need to examine the <br>planned area’s level of population and employment gr owth to make certain the market to be serviced is <br>sustainable. A competitor analysis would need to be cond ucted, since this will affect the demand for the small <br>business’s products . The proposed target market would need to be attracted to its offering.  <br>Jobber (2010) further notes that geographic information systems (GIS) can assist a small -business owner in <br>selecting the most appropriate store location. The system is designed to pro file geographical areas according <br>to factors such as disposable income, fami ly size, age and rates of birth. Following this approach could help <br>the small -business owner to identify t he best location for its specific target market.  <br>5.5.5 Ineffective marketi ng of products and lack of market knowledge  <br>Many research studies have shown  small businesses often under -utilise and misunderstand marketing (Fuller, <br>2012: 34; Hogarth -Scott,  Watson  & Wilson, 2006: 6; Mackintosh & Tynan, 2011). Some small -business <br>owners view marketing as expensive and time -consuming, requiring specialised expert ise and therefore only <br>relevant for larger businesses. There is also a tendency among small -business owner s to view advertising as a <br>waste of money and to consider “word -of-mouth” communications as more effective for their businesses <br>(Hogarth -Scott et al.,  2006: 14). Kroon and Moolman (2012) have the opinion that the initial costs of getting <br>any SME up and run ning are high and, as such, marketing costs do not take priority.  <br>Parrot, Roomi and Holliman (2010) highlight an additional number of mistakes that ha ve been made by small -<br>business owners, including: insufficient knowledge of customer’s behaviour and attit udes; failure to segment <br>the market effectively; absence of a planning pro cess; misunderstanding their marketing strengths; and <br>adapting a narrow and short -term approach to promotion. Marketing activities have also not been <br>comprehensively recorded and mon itored and limited flexibility was demonstrated to develop new ideas. The <br>small -business owners they investigated did not have a commercially valid un derstanding of their customers <br>and marketplaces and failed to monitor customer behaviour.  <br>Parrot et al. (2 010: 198) continue that “… in essence, SMEs are repeating the ‘classic’ mi stakes of larger <br>organizations in assuming, guessing and making gut -feel dec isions. If these decisions are misplaced the <br>consequences could be and often are grievous”. They believe t hat if small -business owners keep on <br>overestimating the effectiveness of t heir marketing programmes, they may not reach their full potential. Their <br>ability to have an in -depth understanding of their marketplace and become competitive in the true sense of t he <br>word is dependent on them developing a deeper and systematic understand ing of their current marketing <br>decision -making processes.  89 <br> 5.5.6 Product pric ing <br>Small businesses experience problems in establishing product prices, which can be a challenging part o f <br>running a successful small business. The small business needs to be comp etitive, but also needs to be profitable <br>to survive. The owners should give answers to the following questions:  <br>• Should prices be based on their competitor’s prices?  <br>• Should prices be based on costs?  <br>• Should prices be based on what the buyer is willing to pay ? <br>The answers to these questions show that small -business owners need to und erstand not only direct costs and <br>indirect expenses but also the competitive market price. The offerings a nd prices of competitors should be <br>compared and the business owner should also establish where the products fit into the existing market. The <br>owners n eed to determine whether they can add value without adding cost. This will enable them to promote <br>those el ements, such as personal customer service, which will enable them to price  products more profitably. <br>Every pricing decision made should offer a win -win outcome so that their customers receive value for their <br>money and the small business receives reasonable  profits. As an example, pricing arts and craft products give <br>a bigger pro blem because the direct costs are not that clear. A simple formula to use ma y be: labour costs plus <br>material used times two, which will give the wholesale price. Pricing products sti ll seems to be one of the <br>biggest problems faced by a small -business owner . <br>5.6 CHALLENGES WHEN EVALUATING A NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY IN AN <br>EMERGING ECONOMY  <br>Every business venture starts with an idea. The idea may be as simple as opening a shop that featur es local <br>artwork or as complex as creating a new biotechnology company. Ei ther way, the success depends on the <br>strength of the idea, how well it fits  the temperament of the small -business owner and the resources available. <br>All ideas will unfortunately not realise a feasible small business. Although emerging economies offer great  <br>new business ideas, it is not easy to start a successful small business. W hen considering starting a small <br>business the business’s potential and owner’s abilities to make it work sh ould be evaluated. Also the risk and <br>benefits should be analysed to minimi se the failure of the business. Usually, small -business owners will start <br>a business, taking into account the technical and managerial skills they possess. However, ideas can also co me <br>from inefficiency in the marketplace. The  business owner may have an in teresting idea of how to do so and <br>has the resources and capability to corr ect that inefficiency. In addition, when conducting market research and <br>it becomes clear that a product or service that is being consumed in one market is not offered in the small -<br>business owner’s market, there is then an opportunity to offer that product.  Self-analysis; prior business <br>experience; market research; risk assessment; support from family and commun ity; and competition analysis <br>are all factors that need to be analysed bef ore starting a small business. These will be described next.  <br>5.6.1 Self -analysis <br>Most small businesses fail because of poor management and the owner’s inability to manage resources ( Van <br>Scheers, 2011). Therefore, before small -business owners start research ing the feasibility of business ideas and <br>their potential markets, they nee d to evaluate their own talents, desires and goals. Their willingness to take <br>risks as well as the amount o f time and energy needed to develop a new, successful business should be <br>evaluated. The owners’ financial, personal and marketing skills should also be assessed to ensure that they <br>have the necessary background to make a success of the new venture. Since a n estimated 90 per cent of all <br>small businesses fail within the first few years, the small -business owner needs to have a plan on how to <br>survive if t he new business fails. Writing a self -assessment in the form of a detailed curriculum vitae (CV) <br>will help to establish a realistic picture. It should list the entrepreneur’s educat ional background and <br>professional experience, hobbies and outside interests . This document may be helpful in separating <br>professional attributes by functional area for example marketi ng, accounting and human -resource skills. A list 90 <br> of personal attributes, f or example, knowing how to work with numbers, communication skills, organis ational <br>skills and people skills will all be useful in starting a small business.  <br>5.6.2 Prior business expe rience  <br>Owning or running a business does not make a person an entrepreneur . Many business owner are really <br>managers in that they run a business that they have copied from someone else. In connection with this <br>observation by Weeks (2002), it is also signifi cant to  note that most respondents of his research study indicated <br>that th ey had a general idea of what management of a business entails, even if they had no previous business <br>experience and though they were not always able to express their ideas in “acade mic ter ms”. The research <br>also indicated that 71.6 per cent of the responde nts were first -time business operators. This reflects relatively <br>low experience in running a business when evaluated in tandem with the number of years the small businesses <br>have oper ated. T he demographic factors indicated that the older the owners, the les s likely they were to leave <br>and the more successful they become. From Weeks’s (2002) study, only 28.4 per cent of the respondents <br>indicated that they had prior business experience. I t seems  that prior experience in running a business is not <br>always an indic ator that the business will be successful. Many factors will determine the success of a small <br>business, such as the economic climate of the country, demand for a product or service a nd disp osable income <br>of consumers, among other factors.  <br>5.6.3 Market resea rch <br>Extensive market research to establish the demand for a product or business and to determine the feasibility <br>of the planned business should be performed. In addition to statistic s of tr ends and current customer buying <br>patterns, the small -business owner  should also know who the customers are, where they are located and what <br>kind of competition exists in the area.  <br>5.6.4 Risk assessment  <br>A complete evaluation of a business opportunity  includ es a risk assessment. An honest appraisal of the <br>potential risks in herent in a new business can assist in preparing for possible problems and a decision on <br>whether the risks are worth the investment. The risk -assessment process includes factors that  could negatively <br>affect the business, such as the general state of the ec onomy and competition. Internal considerations should <br>include the owner’s health, the level of credit available and the number and type of employees needed to run <br>the business effici ently.  <br>5.6.5 Support from family and community  <br>The small -business owner sh ould also evaluate the amount of support expected from family and the <br>community. Usually, an inordinate amount of time will be spent in the initial stages of opening a new business, <br>which c ould affect family relationships. Attitudes and cultural preference s in the community can have an <br>impact on the ability to grow and sustain a small business.  <br>5.6.6 Competitor analysis  <br>The small -business owner should conduct a competitor analysis. Qu estions  to assist the small -business owner <br>are: <br>• How many similar small bus inesses are in the market?  <br>• Which product or service are they offering?  <br>• Does this business idea meet a need or solve a problem?  <br>• Does the small -business owner understand the customer n eeds be tter than other small businesses at the <br>moment?  <br>Positive answers wi ll give the small -business owner the opportunity to zero in on the price points and feature <br>points that will differentiate it from existing players in the market. It is important to remembe r that customers <br>spend money because they believe that what they bu y can solve their problems, fulfil their needs, or satisfy 91 <br> their desires. If the business idea does not address a real problem, need, or desire, getting it off the ground will <br>be dou bly dif ficult. Another important question to be asked is: Will this busine ss idea make money and how <br>fast? The following questions need to be answered:  <br>• How long will it take before the business idea will generate profits?  <br>• Who specifically will spend money on the product or service?  <br>• After the sales start rolling in, can the small -business owner sustain profitability over time?  <br>5.7 CONCLUSION  <br>It is clear that the small -business sector contributes to the economic growth of emerging nations and alleviates <br>unemp loyment in South Africa. Although it is an important sector, research indi cates that it is very difficult <br>to start a small business in an emerging economy. Starting a new business can lead to personal and financial <br>benefits but the small -business owner wil l face a number of challenges when starting out. General, financial <br>and ma nagerial skills; marketing -skills challenges and challenges eval uating new business opportunities were <br>identified and outlined in this chapter.  <br>REVIEW QUESTIONS  <br>5.1 Write short notes  on general challenges for starting a small business.

Uncertai nty can be used to your benefit <br>if you create and employ an entrepreneurial mindset – a way of  thinking that captures the benefits of <br>uncertainty. Entrepreneurial strategy is important for business in the 21st century. Entrepreneurship is a bout <br>creation, a nd strategic management is about how advantage is established and maintained from what is crea ted. <br>Research shows that traditional approaches and strategies can also apply to new venture firms and small <br>businesses. Business survival is lowe st when business es are small and young, and thus the development of <br>effective strategies is critical for the c ontinuity of the business (Lechner & Gudmundson, 2014: 36).  <br>Entrepreneurs are pivotal as agents of change to transform local communities. Entrepre neurs recognise <br>opportunity, mobilise resources and create value and therefore are key to the creation of inst itutions and the <br>building of capacity that will sustain economic development.  <br>Resources are defined as tangible or intangible assets that are tied  semi -permanentl y to the firm. These include <br>all assets, capabilities, organisational processes, firm attribut es, information, knowledge and so on, that are <br>controlled by a firm. Resources enable a firm to conceive and implement strategies that improve eff iciency <br>and effe ctiveness.  <br>6.2 ENTREPRENEURSHIP  <br>As explained in  Chapter 1 , entrepreneurship is the  dynamic process  of creating incremental wealth. It involves <br>vision, change and creation. It requires an appli cation of energy and passion towards the creation and <br>implementation of new ideas and creative solutions. An entrepreneur must have some essential  characteristics  <br>which include  <br>• the willingness to take calculated risks  <br>• the ability to formulate an effective venture team  97 <br> • the skills to marshal the needed resources  <br>• the knowledge to build a solid business  <br>• the capability to plan  <br>• the vision to recognise opportunity where o thers see chaos, contradiction and confusion (Kuratko, 2009: 5).  <br>Entrepreneurship has emerged as a focal point for economic policy as an instrument for generating growth, <br>jobs and economic development. Innovation is the source of growth and competitive adv antage. A new venture <br>is typically created to pursue the realisation of innovations into the m arketplace.  <br>6.3 ENTREPRENEURIAL STRATEGY  <br>6.3.1 Definition  <br>Entrepreneurial strategy is defined by Morris et al. (2010: 1 94) as a vision directed, organisation -wide  reliance <br>on entrepreneurial behaviour that purposefully and continuously rejuvenates the orga nisation and shapes the <br>scope of its operations through the recognition and exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunity . <br>Entrepreneurial strategy is the component  of corporate strategy that promotes the persistent search for <br>competitive advantage through i nnovation (Russel & Russel, 1992: 640). Without specific goals and strategies <br>for innovation, entrepreneurship in an en terprise will happen by chance or haphazard ly. Some emerging <br>countries, for example Zimbabwe, have a diverse number of indigenous entrepr eneurs who have established <br>successful enterprises, which have gone through the established obstacles for entrepreneurs . <br>Entrepreneurial strategy is concerned wit h applying creativity and entrepreneurial thinking to the development <br>of a core strategy for t he firm. Entrepreneurial and strategic actions are often intended to find new markets or <br>competitive space for the firm  to create wealth. The degree to which the firm acts entrepreneurially in terms <br>of innovativeness, risk taking and proactivity is related  to dimensions of strategic management.  <br>Dominant logic refers to the way in which managers conceptualise the business a nd make critical resource -allocation <br>decisi ons. Managers will often consider only information that is believed to be relevant to the firm ’s prevailing dominant logic. <br>Morris, Kuratko and Covin (2010) suggest creating a dynamic dominant logic in order to ma ke entrepreneurship the basis <br>upon which th e organisation is conceptualised and resources are allocated. As a dominant logic, entrepreneu rship promotes <br>strategic agility, flexibility, creativity and continuous innovation throughout the firm. When entrepren eurship is introduced to <br>strategy, the poss ibilities regarding where the firm can go, how fast and how it gets there are greatly enhanced . <br>6.4 ENTREPRENEURIAL VARIABLES  <br>There are entrepreneurial variables that make up the entrepreneurial strategy mix and t hese will now be <br>discussed. According to Lu mpkin and Dess (in Lechner & Gudmundson, 2014: 38), entrepreneurial <br>orientation is now afforde d five dimensions, which are discussed below. There is a positive link between firms <br>exhibiting innovativeness, risk ta king and proactive action, and firm growth and performance.  <br>6.4.1 Innovativeness  <br>Innovativeness is the ability to introduce a new product , service or process (Iakovleva, 2013: 18). <br>Innovativeness is the predisposition to engage in creativity and experiment ation through the introduction of <br>new produ cts/services as well as technological leadership via research and development in new processes  <br>(Lumpkin, Moss, Gras, Kato & Amezcua, 2013: 769). Innovativeness entails supporting and encouraging new <br>ideas as well as experimentation and creativity and is se en as the key element of the entrepreneurial orientation <br>concept. Innovativeness is said to be  present when firms pursue active implementation of new ideas, products, 98 <br> processes and not merely their generation. Cre ativity is the source of innovativeness, wh ich leads to innovation <br>of products, services, processes, markets and technology. Innovativene ss is usually characterised by  <br>• a strong research and development emphasis  <br>• technological leadership  <br>• the introduction of new products  <br>• the degree of changes to produ ct or service lines.  <br>Innovativeness can be used to create differentiation advantage through un iqueness. It is also a chief means by <br>which firms can create differentiati on and develop solutions that undermine those of competitors. Innovation <br>is often viewed  as the root of entrepreneurship, which often leads to sustainable growth and development. The  <br>stimulation of innovation activity is crucial for the competitive advanta ge and growth of companies and, <br>eventually, the economy. Innovations need not always be spectacular technological breakthroughs; the bulk <br>of innovations in modern society consists of  small improvements that come from day -to-day learning <br>(Iakovleva, 2013: 1 7). Moreover, a sustainable competitive advantage can only be achieved through <br>continuou s innovation and the creation of new ideas.  <br>Smaller firms may face difficulties in scaling up their internal innovation efforts to achieve radical innovations. <br>This may  be due to  <br>• a lack of an internal R&D department  <br>• a limited resource base and therefore ac cess to economies of scale  <br>• having a small strategic focus, and risk being locked into their pr esent strategy.  <br>This is also the reason why a small enterprise needs an en trepreneurial strategy. The scarcity of resources <br>makes the task of innovation extremely  challenging for small firms. Some research has suggested open <br>innovation as one of the ways i n which a small enterprise can overcome some of the above -mentioned <br>challe nges. Open innovation refers to the use of purposive inflows and outflows of knowledge t o accelerate <br>internal innovation and expand the markets for external use of innovation (Iakovl eva, 2013: 18). This means <br>that enterprises should use external as well as  internal ideas in order to advance their technology. Innovations <br>can easily transfer be tween inward and outbound, between firms, or between firms and creative consumers. <br>Open innova tion supports the notion that competitive advantage often comes from inbou nd as well as <br>outbound connections. Thinking in terms of open innovation may provide new  ways of solving the specific <br>challenges facing a small enterprise. If there is little innovat ion, there is little that one can gain from <br>participating in the market. A  society gains from innovative and highly competitive entrepreneurs because <br>they will pr oduce more innovative and competitively priced products. Below is an example of how an <br>entrepr eneur or small business manager can come up with innovative ideas to solve  everyday problems.  <br>CASE STUDY  <br>The story of 23 -year-old innovator Harald Oswin and his l ight-bulb moment is no different. As the country faces ongoing load <br>shedding Oswin believes he  may have come up with a way to lower the strain on the country’s energy grid during peak hours. <br>He and his team have made energy -sector role players sit up and t ake notice after creating a device that switches <br>homeowners’ geysers on and off at preprogramm ed times. Oswin is the chief executive of FNS Energy, the company behind <br>the gadget dubbed the Geyserflicker. Oswin says that the idea for the device was sparked during an internship in Cape Town <br>in 2012 when he was sharing a flat with several students. “M y flatmates were very concerned about conserving energy and <br>shifting elec tricity usage out of peak demand periods. They therefore switched the geyser off as much as they could and then <br>switched it back on before they needed a warm shower,” recalls Oswin. A s it takes up to two hours to reheat the water, this <br>meant he had to wake  up during the early hours of the morning to ensure he had hot water by 6 a.m. – by when he needed to <br>get ready for work. “I realised that this was not an efficient way of doing thing s and on further investigation I realised that it <br>was not just us, it was  a hassle that my neighbours, my colleagues and my community faced.” And so the idea for the device <br>was born.  <br>Source:  Small Business Connect, 2015.  <br>Questions  <br>1. Do you think Oswin was in novative? Describe how, using the case study.  <br>2. What other entrepreneurial variable(s) did he possess in launching his idea?  <br>3. How does Oswin’s idea make a difference  to you personally?  99 <br> A strong emphasis on innovativeness mobilises entry into new arenas, renew s the firm’s presence in existing <br>ones and emb odies a capability to explore new possibilities. Innovativeness can have a positive impact on <br>performance and contri butes to competitive advantage by facilitating creative thinking within a firm’s learning <br>activities. Therefore it improves the application of market intelligence acquired through market -orientation <br>activities, which can, in turn, benefit performance. Smal l firms often develop as a result of new innovations <br>and they can benefit and grow from remain ing innovative and relevant in the market. Bei ng innovative is <br>clearly a creative undertaking. While it is not possible to force creativity, it is possible to cre ate an environment <br>that is more supportive of fostering creativity.  <br>6.4.2 Risk taking  <br>One of t he characteristics of entrepreneurship is taki ng risks. Risk taking involves taking bold actions by <br>venturing into the unknown, borrowing heavily and/or committin g significant resources to ventures into <br>uncertain environments (Lumpkin et al., 2013: 769). R isk taking represents a willingness to commit resources <br>to implement projects, activities and solutions that inherently contain a high level of uncertainty regard ing the <br>likely outcomes. Small -business managers may differ in their risk -taking behaviour and  perception of <br>affordable loss, which influenc es entrepreneurial choices. Risk taking is a principal characteristic of an <br>entrepreneur.  <br>Risk-taking orientation is  the willingness of an entrepreneur to invest resources in a venture or project where <br>the outc ome may be highly uncertain or unknown. Positi ve risk taking often leads to entrepreneurial success. <br>A good entrepreneur must  <br>• be calculative  <br>• possess risk -taking b ehaviour in all aspects of business.  <br>Baird and Thomas (1985) propose three types of risk takin g of an entrepreneurial organisation.  <br>1. The firs t risk is associated with obtaining a loan to fund a project or to start up in the case of a new <br>venture. When firms  borrow heavily, it places huge financial pressure on the firm and can erode <br>profitability and  performance; the inability to repay may lead to the dilution of the entrepreneur’s <br>equity in the venture.  <br>2. The second type of risk taking is associated with exces sive commitment of resources into a particular <br>project or investment. In other circumstances, it is possible for a firm to start with few fu nds for a <br>particular project and, as it continues, more funds need to be committed if the expected result has not <br>been achieved.  <br>3. The third type of risk is the risk of venturing into the unknown. This is common when a firm commits <br>resources to research aime d at a positive result; if the result is negative the amount invested goes down <br>the drain, leading to a loss. Implem entation of any strategy is not without risk – an important decision <br>variable for any entrepre neur is potential loss in the event of failure . <br>Furthermore, when deciding to take risks, firms must be able to tolerate one of two possible scenarios: the <br>first being the risk of failing and the second being the risk of missing out on an opportunity. The first one is <br>caused by fear of venturing into the unknown and the second is caused by not taking any action when an <br>opportunity arises in the market. A tolerance of risk taking orients the firm toward action and induces it to <br>embrace uncertainty. A firm ne eds to master the art of taking timely risks i n order to reap the full benefits of <br>taking that particular risk. Timely risk taking is associated with speedy strat egy decision making and both <br>have been  subsequently linked to improved business performance. W ithout a degree of risk taking, firms delay <br>or refrain from introducing innovations, undertaking exploitative activities and react conservatively to <br>changing mark et conditions. The result in this case would be weaker performance as the firm would be doing <br>little to seize customer and market opportunit ies. <br>A firm should therefore be able to manage its risk. Risk management usually involves seizing opportunities <br>and committing resources before fully understanding what action needs to be taken. Such an approac h seeks <br>to take advantage of evolving situatio ns by capitalising on the fact that markets rarely stabilise for any length <br>of time. Risk aversion renders firms pas sive to developing new market opportunities, which is likely to 100 <br> deteriorate performance in an age of rapid change. Small businesses in emerg ing economies must therefore <br>be able to manage their risk and position themselves to exploit opportunities when they  arise in the market.  <br>6.4.3 Proactiveness  <br>Proactiveness is an opportunity -seeking forward -looking perspective characterised by the introduct ion of new <br>products and services ahead of the competition and acting in anticipation of future demand (Lumpkin et al ., <br>2013: 769). This refers to the process that anticipates and acts on future needs by seeking  new opportunities, <br>which may or may not be re lated to the present lines of operations, the introduction of new products and brands <br>ahead of competition, and stra tegically eliminating operations that are in the mature or declining stages of <br>their life cycl e. <br>Proactiveness anticipates competitive moves  and maintains first -mover advantage and it involves the <br>identification and evaluation of new opportunities and the monitoring of marketing trends. Proactiveness in <br>firms is characterised by intentional change that forcibly acts on information to make chan ges rather than <br>merely anticipating it. This alleviates the risk of complacency by ensuring that firms are better pl aced to serve <br>markets in the short term and shape them in the longer term. The emphasis on ant icipating and acting on future <br>needs orients t he firm to seize initiative and act opportunistically in the marketplace, thereby shaping demand. <br>The proactive firm  adopts continuous environmental scanning and acts in advance to change in order to serve <br>customers and markets better, rather than allow it s destiny to be guided by external forces. Proactiveness <br>leverages the firm’s responsiveness capability and propensi ty to act to meet new circumstances. For example, <br>a shoemaker observed how much the shoes of s ecurity guards were worn out (the shoes form p art of their <br>uniform). When the shoes were worn out, he contacted the head office to make an offer to produce shoes for <br>this company.  <br>At the early stages of an enterprise, proactiveness is critical for performa nce improvement. Small and <br>resource -constraine d enterprises, in particular, have an interest in exploiting time advantages. Proactiveness <br>deals with anticipating and creating future demand, pre -empting competition and favouring uniqueness.  <br>A firm with stro ng proactive tendencies tends to be able to  <br>• anticipate changes in the market and customer needs  <br>• forge a new market segment  <br>• introduce new products and services ahe ad of competitors.  <br>A proactive firm is expected to: take the initiative and anticipate future problems; pursue new activities; and <br>introdu ce new products and services. As a result, proactive firms become first movers and are rewarded with <br>a marketplace pos ition of competitive advantage with higher returns, distribution channels and brand <br>recognitio n. Increasing the firm’s receptiveness to ma rket signals and awareness of customers needs <br>(expressed or latent) are two of the main advantages offered by proactiv eness. Proactive firms, through <br>proprietary learning and experience gained over time, tend to be more attuned to changes and trends in the  <br>marketplace, which yields opportunities to the firm to meet expressed and latent needs before competitors do.  <br>6.4.4 C ompetitive aggressiveness  <br>This refers to the intensity of a firm’s efforts to outperform compe titors, gain an ambitious market share, set <br>goals or take aggressive action such as price cutting or building larger production capacities. Competitive <br>aggressive ness is characterised by a  strong offensive posture or aggressive responses to the actions of <br>competitors  (Lumpkin et al., 2013: 769). Competitive aggressiveness can take the form of deliberate action as <br>well as reactive action. In this way, a business can  outdo competitors. This i nvolves taking an offensive stance <br>at overcoming threatening competi tors in order to control larger market shares. An aggressive firm stepping <br>in and taking over markets might result in product price cuts and securing easy access to rival -based markets. <br>The aggressive marketing of products or services and the improvement o f product or service qualities are often <br>embarked upon to drive competitors out of the market. There are three possible ways for firms to aggressively <br>compete, wh ich are  101 <br> • doing it different ly <br>• refining the product and/market  <br>• outspending the industry leader w ith the aim of becoming the industry leader.  <br>Higher investments means that the stakes require strategic decision makers to have a higher tolerance level <br>for affor dable loss while low risk -taking entrepreneurs tend to underinvest. The actions above enable f irms to <br>acquire a substantial share of the market, outperform competitors and increase income.  <br>Firms that are highly aggressive see competitors as enemies that mu st be conquered. Aggressiv eness can be <br>implemented through the mobilisation of resources to la unch direct attacks on competitors with the aim of <br>overwhelming their market efforts, steadily erode their competitive strengths or establish advantage through <br>continuous offensive tactics . The aggressive firm also sees value as accruing from leveraging ad aptive <br>capabilities to consistently undermine competitors’ effects in the market as opposed to adopting a passive <br>stance to competition.  <br>6.4.5 Autonomy  <br>Autonomy r efers to the ability to wo rk independently, make decisions and take actions aimed at bringing forth <br>a business concept and carrying it through to completion (Lumpkin et al., 2013: 769). Autonomy reflects the <br>strong desire of a person to have freedom in the  development of an idea an d its implementation within an <br>organisation. It also connotes the wi ll and ability to be self -directed in the pursuit of environmental <br>opportunities and the associated challenges. It allows employees to be self -directed, exercise creativity, pursue <br>opportu nities and champion new ideas that are essential for effective entre preneurial activity to occur. This <br>enhances a firm’s ability to make quick and self -reliant decisions to provide the market with new products and <br>services. Autono my is a necessary conditio n for customer orientation and allows employees to  <br>• be creative  <br>• devel op new ideas and open communication  <br>• be focused on customer interaction and orientation.  <br>Employees in an entrepreneurial firm need greater autonomy and self -regula tion to determine what act ions <br>are required and when and how to execute them. This translates to quicker decision making that enhances <br>positive performance. Autonomy also drives flexibility and creativity. Flexibility, in turn, allows businesses <br>to react f aster to customer needs wh ile creativity drives innovation and uniqueness. Small firms are com monly <br>characterised by less formalisation and unsophisticated control systems, which lead to greater autonomy.  <br>Two types of autonomy have been identified in entre preneurship literature; th e autocratic mode and the generic <br>mode.  <br>6.4.5.1 Autocratic mode  <br>The autocratic mode refers to an entrepreneurial decision -making strategy that allows a strong leader to take <br>decisive risky actions for an enterprise. This type of a utonomy occurs often in smaller enterprises and may <br>refer to the style of certain owners o r managers of firms. Most entrepreneurs with an autonomous orientation <br>maintain a higher level of entrepreneurial activity, which gives them an edge over their compet itors.  <br>6.4.5.2 Generic mode  <br>The generic mode refers to decentralisation of expected action s am ong staff members of a firm. Ideas <br>generated by members of staff are passed through to management for consideration. This usually happens in <br>bigger organisations where ideas need to be approved by senior management.  <br>Therefore, firms need to put in plac e policies of empowerment, open communication, unrestricted access to <br>information and the authority  to think and act without interference. By establishing autonomy, m anagers <br>demonstrate to employees their faith in their ability to perform effectively outsi de the rubric of firm <br>constraints. Such autonomy, in turn, encourages employees to participate in change and become actively <br>involved in entrepreneurial activity. If there are constraints in the actions and activities that employees can 102 <br> take, entrepreneuri al activity is likely to fail and the performance of the firm is likely to suffer as employees <br>fail to deviate from established practices when necessary. Autonomy wil l allow the firm to implement change <br>quickly when the need arises.  <br>For emerging young firm s with limited resources, understanding which of the five entrepreneurial orientations <br>are most valuable to secure improved performance at their potentially vulnerabl e stage of development is an <br>important priority. Liabilities of newness may explain why sm all firms sometimes struggle to achieve strong <br>business performance. With weak resources and knowledge base, these firms may be unable to make full and <br>effective use of an entrepreneurial orientation, which is resource intensive when implemented.  <br>6.5 ENTR EPREN EURIAL STRATEGY MATRIX  <br>Sonfield and Lussier (1997) developed an entrepreneurial strategy matrix (ESM) to provide an alternative to <br>more complex models that existe d earlier. The matrix measures risk and innovation. The entrepreneurial <br>strategy matrix i s a s ituational model in which the identification of levels of innovation and risk lead to <br>prescriptions of appropriate strategies.  <br>Innovation  <br>Innovation is defined as  the creation of something new and different.  <br>Risk  <br>Risk is defined as the probability of major  financial loss.  <br>The matrix consists of appropriate strategies that small businesses can choose from and the mix between <br>innovation and risk (variables).  <br>The entr epreneurial strategy mix suggests appropriate strategies for both new and ongoing venture s in <br>response to the identification of different levels of venture innovation and risk. The ESM is appropriate for <br>small -business managers and entrepreneurs to use as it allows even the most inexperienced entrepreneurs to <br>characterise their new or existing  venture situations and identify appropriate strategies; most strategy models <br>tend to be too complex to use in a small -business setting.  <br>The ESM: Independent variables  <br>RISK  <br>LOW     High innovation  <br>Low risk  High innovation  <br>High risk  <br>HIGH  Low innovation  <br>Low risk  Low innovation  <br>High risk  <br> <br> <br>Source:  Sonfield & Lussier (1997: 74)  <br>The four cells in the ESM derive from two axes, innovation and risk. The top -left cell of the m atrix (I -r) is the <br>most desirable cell for an entrepreneurial venture with high innovation and  low risk. The top -right cell of the 103 <br> matrix represents high risk an d high innovation (H -I) and is therefore less desirable. These ventures often <br>include unique pr oducts or services, but the risk is high, because of initial high investment or because of <br>competition. The lower -right cell, low innovation and high risk, is pr obably the most familiar to small firms. <br>Most new business start -ups involve somewhat conventio nal entries into well -established fields. Low <br>innovation and low risk is when minimal investme nt is required, or market demand is strong and competition <br>is weak.  Therefore risk will not be very high. Some businesses, such as service businesses, may require  <br>minimal financial investment. The matrix suggests to both new and ongoing entrepreneurs that some ventures <br>are more desirable than others in terms of likely out come, success and rewards. Furthermore, it suggests <br>strategy modification so as to move within the matrix from a less desirable cell to a more desirable cell.  <br> <br>The ESM: Appropriate strategi es <br>RISK  <br>LOW  • Move quickly  <br>• Protect innovation  <br>• Lock in investment and operating costs via <br>control systems  • Reduce risk by lowering investment and <br>operating costs  <br>• Main tain innovation  <br>• Outsource high investment operations  <br>• Joint -venture options  <br>HIGH  • Low innovatio n <br>• Defend present position  <br>• Accept limited payback  <br>• Accept limited growth potential on Low risk  • Increase innovation; develop a <br>competitive advantage  <br>• Reduce risk  <br>• Use business plan and objective analysis  <br>• Minimise investment  <br>• Reduce financing costs  <br>• Franchise opti on <br>• Abandon venture?  <br> <br> <br>Source:  Sonfield & Lussier (1997: 75)  <br>The value of the matrix is that it suggests appropriate strategies for different entrepreneurs. The small firm <br>can choose from the matrix which strategy would be most appropriate given the circu mstances of the business  <br>at a particular time. The entrepreneur must therefore identify the cell that best describes the new or existing <br>venture and choose a stra tegy that is more likely to be effective. The matrix answers these questions: what <br>venture sit uation are you in? What are the best strategic alternatives for a given venture? An entrepreneur <br>therefore first evaluates the levels of innovation and risk for t he venture and identifies which of the four cells <br>it is in. Then the entrepreneur decides whic h of the strategies sugg ested in that cell to use. Entrepreneurs and <br>small -business managers will find the above matrix valuable in strategic decision making.  <br>Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that are often confronted with resource scarcity can make use  of <br>networking, which is  associated with the sharing of resources, capabilities, technologies and access to markets. <br>Networking allows firms to access resources t hey do not own or control but are necessary for a firm’s <br>competitive advantage. Networking can  also be imperative in s haring risk and resources in capital -intensive <br>ventures or in an environment with weak regulatory frameworks, as found in Tanzania where e ntrepreneurs <br>feel less protected.  104 <br> Entrepreneurial strategy making reflects the extent to which  a firm is committed to risk taking, innovativeness <br>and proactiveness in developing and implementing its strategy. As seen before, entrepreneurial strategy is <br>resource consuming and therefore small firms can benefit from networking.  <br>6.6 CONCLUSION  <br>In suppo rt of the growth of smal l businesses, it will be essential for a broad array of policy instruments to be <br>put in place so that it will stimulate R&D activities and  science and technology in the country. As an emerging <br>economy, South Africa will benefit from  innovation. It is not a lways easy for small firms to engage in the <br>practices discussed in this chapter, mainly due to a lack of resources. Support in terms of re sources could assist <br>entrepreneurs and small -business managers to develop strategies that will  ensure their survival a nd ultimate <br>success. The government could set up assistance in the form of what each small business needs specifically; <br>this will also ass ist in creating jobs in the economy where unemployment is on the rise. Encouraging <br>innovation in small - and medium -sized businesses remains at the front of policy initiatives for stimulating <br>economic development in emerging economies. The emerging -markets environment is considered a growing <br>market where many emerging opportunities exist in which en trepreneurial -oriented f irms, through proactive <br>behaviour, can take the advantage to exploit and enhance the firm’s performance.  <br>REVIEW QUESTIONS  <br>6.1 Define entre preneurial strategy.  <br>6.2 Describe the terms: innovativeness, risk taking, competitive aggressi veness, proactiveness, a utonomy.  <br>6.3 Briefly discuss the different entrepreneurial variables.  <br>6.4 What are the characteristics of innovativeness?  <br>6.5 Describe the  difficulties small businesses often face in achieving innovativeness.  <br>6.6 Explain the three t ypes of risk -taking actions in an entrepreneurial firm.  <br>6.7 Name the benefits of proactiveness in an entrepreneurial firm.  <br>6.8 Describe the three poss ible ways in  which firms can aggressively compete.  <br>6.9 Discuss the two types of autonomy.  <br>6.10 Describe ne tworking and the advantages associated with it.  <br>REFERENCES  <br>Baird, I.S. & Thomas, H. 1985.

Str ategic planning is one of the most used tools in large and successful <br>organisations across the globe (Rigby, 201 5). Strategic planning could benefit sma ll firms and help them grow <br>beyond the average failure period. Strategic planning is a comprehensive pro cess for determining what a <br>business should become and how it can best achieve that goal. It appraises the full potential of a business and <br>explicitly l inks the business’s objectives to the actions and resources required to achieve them. Strategic <br>planning  offers a systematic process to ask and answer the most critical questions confronting managers <br>(Rigby, 2015: 54 ). <br>7.2 DEFINITION  <br>There is no commonly a ccepted and universal definition of strategic planning. However, for the purpose of <br>this chapter, the fo llowing definition is useful: strategic planning is the formulation of long -range plans for <br>the effective manage ment of environmental opportunities and threats in light of a venture’s strengths and <br>weaknesses. The value that can be derived from the strateg ic-planning process is the strategic thinking that it <br>promotes among business owners. Although not always articu lated formally, especially in small firm s, <br>strategic thinking synthesises the intuition and creativity of an entrepreneur into a vision for the future.  <br>A variety of tools and techniques have been developed to help managers identify and deal with strategic -<br>planning decisions. The benefits of thes e various tools include increasing awareness about the business <br>environment, strategic issues, and oppor tunities and threats, which help reduce the risks involved in making <br>certain decisions.  <br>The best strategic plan for a business is influenced by many fac tors. These include: the abilities of the <br>entrepreneur; the complexity of the venture; and the nature of  the industry in which the business operates. 107 <br> Whatever the specific situation of a business, there are five basi c steps that can be followed in strategi c <br>planning (Hitt, Ireland & Hoskisson, 2009):  <br>1. Examine the internal and external environments of the vent ure (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, <br>threats).  <br>2. Formulate the venture’s long -range and short -range strategi es (mission, objectives, strategies, pol icies).  <br>3. Implement the strategic plan (programmes, budgets, procedures).  <br>4. Evaluate the performance of the strategy.  <br>5. Take follow -up action through continuous feedback.  <br>In more detail, a successful strategic -planning pro cess should  <br>• describe the organisation’s mission, vision and fundamental values  <br>• target potential business arenas and explore each market for emer ging threats and opportunities  <br>• analyse the company’s strengths and weaknesses relative to competitors  <br>• identify and evaluate alternative strategies  <br>• devel op an advantageous business model that will profitably differentiate the company from its competitors  <br>• prepare programmes, policies and plans to implement the strategy  <br>• allocate resources to develop critical capabilities  <br>• plan for, and respond to, contingenci es or environmental changes  <br>• evaluate an d monitor performance.  <br>The final steps in the strategic -planning process involve implementing and controlling strategies to ensure that <br>the mission and objectives are achieved. Successful implementation of strategies requires effective and <br>efficient suppor t systems throughout the firm, which is easier for most small fir ms since they don’t have <br>sophisticated management functions.  <br>Robinson and Pearce (1984) argued that strategic planning is not a popular practice among s mall and medium <br>enterprises (SMEs), bec ause they do not have the time or staff to invest in strategic pl anning. They further <br>argued that research on the impact of strategic planning for SMEs has been inconclusive because many SMEs <br>do not plan. Verreynne, M eyer and Liesch (2014: 3) suggest that SMEs use informal approaches to strategy <br>making, which will reduc e complexity and allow firms to compete efficiently. A study by Dincer, Tatoglu and <br>Glaister (2006) showed that Turkish SMEs were increasingly turning t heir attention towards strategic -<br>planni ng practices. This was probably because of the many benefits of s trategic planning for SMEs. <br>Furthermore, Wang, Walker and Redmond (2007) have established that strategic -planning practices are more <br>common in better -performing SMEs. This shows that planning , in any form, can be useful for the success of <br>a small business.  <br>7.3 STRATEGIC -PLANNING TYPES  <br>According to Mintzberg and Waters (1985), there are different ways a firm can approach strategic planning, <br>which are discu ssed below.  <br>• Planned:  in this case the strategy is crafted by authority/leadership with precise intention s and goals. All <br>actions are backed by a control system leaving no flexibility for actions not included in the strategic plan. <br>The environment needs to be controlled by the organisation in o rder not to disrupt the actions and a <br>planned approach is consider ed to be the most deliberate. This type of strategic planning is mostly seen in <br>large, well -established organisations where there are many systems in pl ace and a “way of doing things” <br>within  the organisation. Most of these systems do not allow flexibility or innovation and creativity to take <br>place.  <br>• Entrepreneurial:  the strategy is the vision of the business owner and has very little tolerance for disrupti ons <br>to the intended strategy. This way  of thinking is usually common in young entrepreneurial organisati ons <br>where not much structure has been established. The participants in the strategic -planning process need <br>to adopt the leader’s vision.  108 <br> • Ideological:  the vision of the organisation is collec tive and is communicated to such a large extent that it <br>becomes an  ideology. The behavior in the firm becomes very strong and formalises a pattern and because <br>of the shared collective vision, it becomes very hard to ch ange.  <br>• Umbrella:  general guidelines are  set for the employees by management, which the employees of the <br>organisation can move within. In this case, the strategy is neither emergent or deliberate because <br>strategies can emerge from the freedom that the employ ees have within the established bounda ries.  <br>• Process:  today’s business environment is turbulent and unpre dictable, therefore management  does not set <br>up a control system; instead the employees are indirectly influenced by the strategy. Management <br>controls th e process of crafting the strategy but  not the content of it.  <br>• Unconnected:  one of the direct strategies where the employee has full power over his or her actions. <br>Strategies can be unconnected from management and can be both deliberate and emergent.  <br>• Consen sus: a strategy without central direct ions from top management, instead the employees are <br>following and learning from each other’s decision patterns in response to the environment.  <br>• Imposed:  the strategy is imposed on the organisation by the environment and  its force is what makes up an <br>organisational pattern. This means that the organisation acts in accordan ce with what the environment <br>dictates at a particular point, therefore it is the most emergent.  <br>A business can choose any of the above strategic -plannin g types to suit its situation and environment. When <br>done well, strategic planning offers a number of ben efits which include  <br>• promotion of strategic thinking, acting and learning  <br>• improved deci sion making  <br>• enhanced organisational effectiveness, responsiveness and resilience  <br>• enhanced organisational legitimacy  <br>• direct benefits for the people involved as it improves  their performance, helps them meet their <br>responsibilities and enhances teamwork and e xpertise.  <br>7.3.1 Strategic planning in small businesses  <br>Strategic p lanning provides comprehensive long -term direction to help a business accomplish its mission. <br>Planning i s one of the key managerial functions and is important because everything else depends  on it. <br>Planning can assist in establishing the direction of a sma ll firm and also set up goals and objectives. However, <br>planning seems to be difficult for most small fir ms as most small -business managers get caught up in the day -<br>to-day activities of runni ng the business.  <br>To become effective in running a small business, managers need to be able to look ahead because before <br>taking any action they must know where they are go ing and how to get there. A well -developed plan has <br>advantages which include  <br>• guidance for the owner and managers in operating the business  <br>• direction and  motivation given to employees  <br>• possible attraction of investors  <br>• creation of a conducive environment to l ure more customers.  <br>Planning requires thinking, takes time and is difficult to do but it helps the small business take advantage of <br>opportunities and co pe with unexpected problems. For strategic planning to be successful, small firms should <br>make use of emp loyee participation, implementation, evaluation and control as capabilities that augme nt each <br>other in successful business strategies. An effective stra tegic -planning process might necessitate or require a <br>change in organisational culture and new skills ac quisition. It is therefore imperative that small firms adjust <br>their activities in tand em with the challenges that come with the key objectives of the st rategic -planning <br>process.  <br>This may be relatively easy to achieve in small firms because planning is usua lly informal and happens as <br>needed. Many small -business managers do not have the time to sit and draft or formalise their plans. Most of <br>the planning ha ppens informally and usually only in the mind of the owner or manager of the firm. This may <br>be because  109 <br> • the day -to-day activities are so time consuming there is no or little time left for pla nning  <br>• there is a lack of knowledge on how to plan  <br>• sometimes manage rs feel that future changes cannot be planned for  <br>• a change in the environment may require a business man ager to act quickly and change certain things in the <br>business.  <br>Some scholars argue that this may be the best kind of planning for small businesses since  it leaves room and <br>flexibility to make changes quickly when the need arises. Therefore the flexibility of small firms is appropriate <br>for informal planning. This, howe ver, does not mean that small firms cannot plan formally. The amount of <br>planning in small  firms is often less than ideal.  <br>7.3.1.1 The different approaches to planning  <br>Firms approach planning di fferently because of the circumstances in which the firm finds  itself. The two basic <br>approaches to planning are formal and informal. Small firms appear to enhance their effectiveness through the <br>informal application of basic strategic decision -making pract ices. Not much benefit is derived from a formal <br>planning proce ss for small businesses. The research by Verreyne et al. has shown that small firms withou t a <br>formal planning process performed just as well as their formal -planning counterparts (Verreyne et al ., 2014: <br>420).  <br>Formal planning  <br>Formal planning places signific antly greater emphasis on specifying goals and objectives, which are <br>prerequisites to a me aningful planning process. A critical aspect of any formal strategic -planning process is <br>thorough scanni ng and analysis of the external environment. This involves the  search and collection of data <br>related to the external environment. The information collec ted can influence planning decisions by providing <br>evidence of customer needs, exposing new technologies or shedding light on future market or technological <br>trends, wh ich are important inputs with regard to the innovation process.  <br>Benefits of formal plannin g <br>Formal planning has the following benefits:  <br>• Compels an organisational approach  <br>• Develops specificity  <br>• Helps identify sources of competitive advantage  <br>• Helps secure res ources  <br>• Sets specific objectives and strategies  <br>• Secures coordination of interrelated activi ties <br>The benefits of formal planning, however, seem to be enjoyed by large organisations. Smaller firms tend to <br>engage in informal and irregular planning activities, if at all. A formal strategic -planning process creates a <br>degree of inflexibility and rigid ness, making efforts to adapt to changes in the external environment difficult <br>especially when managers become strictly tied to their strategic plans. When the overal l environment in which <br>strategic planning takes place becomes overly formalised, the proce ss is likely to become too complicated, <br>inflexible and a restraining factor in participants’ creativity.  Firms, therefore, should strive to create a <br>structured planni ng process while concurrently building more flexible decision -making processes.  <br>Informal p lanning  <br>Informal planning does not include formal written documentation, reports or activities. There is  minimal <br>emphasis on broad goals, company mission and long -term objectives, which are crucial in a formal plan. In <br>informal planning the emphasis is on resource evaluation, assessment of capabilities and environmental <br>analysis. The fact that the process is  informal does not mean that it is not comprehensive. Planning  in this case <br>is not documented and usually happens in the “head” of the small firm owner/ manager.  110 <br> Benefits of informal planning  <br>• Does not interfere with the day to day running of the business.  <br>• Small firms are often unsophisticated therefore informal planning is sufficiently effective.  <br>• The small firm environment is dynamic and may make a formal plan redundant.  <br>The success of informal planning in some firms does not, however, mean that less planni ng/formal planning <br>is unnecessary.  <br>Both formal and informal planning require the small -business owner or manager to scan the environment, <br>identify a dist inctive competence, deploy financial or physical resources and monitor/control the <br>implementation. This  usually happens over a long -term period. Small firms’ orientation is more short term; it <br>may be that planning more than six months ahead would be redund ant for any small firm in a fast -evolving <br>market. To support the informal approach often employed by sm all firms, another perspective on strategy was <br>established and is discussed in the  next section . <br>7.3.2 Strategy as practice (S -A-P) <br>Relatively little is known about the actual activities that lead to the formation of a strategic plan  or the purposes <br>that these activities serve within the organisation. These gaps in knowledge are reflected in the S -A-P-<br>approach perspective, which analyses the micro processes involved in strategic planning. The strategy -as-<br>practice approach is an emerging fo cus aimed at understanding the detailed processes and practices that <br>constitute the day -to-day activiti es of organisational life and which relate to strategic outcomes.  <br>Traditionally, strategy research has mainly focused on firm level; that is, studying or ganisational processes or <br>macro -level positions, for example corporate -level strategy. Macro level expl ores and attempts to explain <br>strategy at the institutional level; which is most typically associated with explaining patterns of action within <br>a specific  industry (Jarzabkowski & Spee, 2009: 73). Recently, a new perspective has emerged within the <br>strategy field, placing the micro -level activities of the “actual work of strategy practitioners” into the centre <br>of consideration. The focus is on strategy as pr actice (S -A-P), aimed at understanding “the detailed processes <br>and practices which constitute the day -to-day activities of organisational life and which relate to strategic <br>outcomes” (Nordqvist, 2012: 26).  <br>Therefore, strategy is increasingly being seen not  only as a process but also as a practice: strategy is something <br>people do (Hambrick, 2004; Jarzabkowsk i, 2004). This view is consistent with the idea that strategy is the tool <br>organisations use to achieve their goals (Ansoff, 1965; Andrews, 1987; Tassiopo ulos, De Coning & Smit, <br>2016). It stands to reason that strategy does not happen by itself – people at all hierarchical levels participate <br>in varying degrees of planning, implementing and controlling. At the core of this approach, as the use of <br>strategisin g might suggest, is a concern about what strategic actors do and the kinds of activities they perform <br>when they strategise. The strategy -as-practice approach has defined its broad research parameters as studying <br>practitioners, praxis and practices (Jarzabk owski & Spee, 2009: 70).  <br>• Practitioners  are the people (actors) who are actually doing the strategic wor k in all its aspects (Whittington, <br>2006; Jarzabkowski & Whittington, 2008).  <br>• Praxis  is defined as the actual work that constitutes strategy and is the flo w of activity through which <br>strategy is accomplished. These activities often take place in a series of o ccurrences and include formal <br>and informal elements as well as routine and non -routine elements.  <br>• Practices  are common habits, behaviours and procedures of thinking, acting and using symbolic objects, and <br>material tools through which strategy is done; theor etically and practically derived tools that have <br>become the everyday lexicon and a ctivity of strategy. Citing Reckwitz’s (2002) work on practice, <br>Jarzab kowski et al. (2007: 9) equate practice with routinised types of behavior, which consist of several <br>elem ents, interconnected to one another. The ‘symbolic objects’ to which Reckwitz (200 2) refers – such as <br>Gantt charts, whiteboards and Post -it notes, may h ave relatively routinised properties in the way they are <br>employed but contribute to different forms of s trategic activity according to their situations of use.  <br>The practice approach clai ms to open up a new view on strategy by engaging with the making of st rategy as <br>an outcome fashioned out of the doing of detailed work (Carter et al., 2008: 83). This means c oncentrating on 111 <br> formal/informal planning and strategising activities within the bu siness, which is relevant also for small firms. <br>The practice perspecti ve’s ability to pay close attention to what is in fact happening in businesses gives <br>researchers a speci al sensitivity to the informal, unscripted activities through which strategies oft en emerge. <br>The starting point of such analyses in small businesses is to focus on practices, as in the current study, that <br>have a strategic role. This means that they form th e basis of organisational success or survival – as in the case <br>of routines or capa bilities serving to create competitive advantage (Vaara & Whittington,  2012: 313). <br>Therefore strategising relies on practices that significantly affect both the process and t he outcome of resulting <br>strategies. The strategy -as-practice perspective is releva nt to small firms because it focuses on the day -to-day <br>activities of m anagers, which is often the emphasis in small firms.  <br>In reality, strategy is something that people do. T herefore it is imperative to explore strategising practices, <br>which include a numbe r of tasks that are primarily derived from the formal strategic manage ment process. <br>These practices  include those theoretically and practically derived tools that have become  part of the everyday <br>lexicon and activity of strategy such as the strengths, weak nesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis <br>(Jarzabkowski & Whit tington, 2008: 282). Although many management tools exist, there is still a need to <br>establish the use or  non-use of these tools in managing small firms. Strategy may often emerge outside  the <br>formal process of planning and the emergent strategies are often successful and may be more appropriate than <br>formal strategies (Balasundaram, 2009: 14; Verreyne et al., 2014). It can therefore be more important to <br>practise strategic management or empl oy strategising practices in the running of a small firm than it is to  <br>follow through the process.  <br>As such, it is essential to look at the doing of strategy, who does it, wha t they do, how they do it, what they <br>use and what implications this has for shapin g overall strategy (Jarzabkowski & Spee, 2009: 69).  <br>7.3.3 Strategic -planning template  <br>The strategic -planning template has been adapted from Pearce and Robinson (2009). The mo del proposed by <br>Pearce and Robinson (2009) will be used as it is a comprehensive t ool encompassing most, if not all, <br>components of other management tool s. <br>Table  7.1 shows that there is a strong relationship between the strategic m anagement process and management <br>tools discussed above. The researcher further superimposed these manage ment tools on the strategic <br>management model developed by Pearce and Robinson (200 9) and Tait and Nienaber (2010). Furthermore, <br>the relationship between  the management tools and strategic management model are depicted in  Figure 7.1 . <br>Small businesses do practise some of the above processes of strategic management albeit not as prescribed  by <br>literature. Most strategic practices in small firms are informal and do not fo llow a particular pattern.  <br>7.3.4 Strategic -planning issues  <br>There are i ssues that can hinder strategic -planning efforts. These are discussed below.  <br>Table 7.1 Strategic managem ent process and management tools  <br>COLUMN A  COLUMN B  <br>Strategic management  Management tools  <br>Develop vision and mission, objectives  Strategic planning  (SP), vision and mission statements  (V&M)  <br>External environment, industry forces  Strategic planning  (SP), scenario planning  (SP1) , benchmarking  (BM)  <br>Internal environment, SWOT  Core competencies  (CC) , strategic planning  (SP), benchmarking  (BM)  112 <br> COLUMN A  COLUMN B  <br>Strategy analy sis and choice  Strategic planning  (SP) <br>Strategy implementation (short -term <br>objectives, functional tacti cs, policies)  Employee engagement  (EE), customer relationship management  (CRM) , <br>balanced scorecard  (BS), change management  (CM)  <br> <br>Figure 7.1 Adapted strategic management model  <br> <br> <br>Sources:  Adapted from Pearce & Robinson (2009); Tait & Nienaber (2010)  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>113 <br> • Leadership . While it is important that planning be distributed throughout the organisation, the top levels of <br>the organisation cannot ta ke a back seat duri ng the planning process. Leaders also need to guard against <br>becoming too focused on current issues to  the detriment of longer -term planning. Furthermore, there <br>should be some level of continuity in planning, and development of new plans should logically bu ild on <br>past success/es.  <br>• Organisational culture.  The culture of an organisation can also have an impac t on the strategic -planning <br>process. What is often thought to be resistance to change is most often really fear of the unknown or <br>distru st in the organisat ion. In a culture that is risk averse or change resistant it is important to build trust <br>and faith th at the process will be fair and equitable and benefit the organisation as a whole.  <br>• Poor implementation.  Managers in the firm need to ens ure that there are continuous cycles of <br>communication about the strategic plan, its goals and how the goals and objectiv es can be integrated into <br>the everyday work of all employees if they expect that the goals and objectives are actually going to be <br>accom plished. For the pl an to succeed, resources need to be channelled to achieve the strategic goals and <br>employees need to b e focused on achieving the strategic goals.  <br>• Failure to develop measurable outcomes.  If the employees do not know how they are doing in r elation to <br>goals, t hey cannot possibly know whether they are achieving the goals or not. Therefore, reporting on <br>perform ance indicators must be built into communications of the plan.  <br>Implementation is important to ensure that a strategic plan is realised. This will be discus sed next.  <br>7.4 PLANNING THE IMPLEMENTATION  <br>The purpose of strategic planning is not solely to generate  plans but also involves implementing strategic <br>initiatives. Although strategic planning usually goes well, implementation is often a problem. The basic <br>assumption underpinning the practice of stra tegic planning is that it is rational to invest resources i n <br>formulating good plans because this will vastly improve the prospects of implementation success. <br>Implementation has been seen as challenging even when go od strategies are chosen. Therefore there is a need <br>to plan the implementation of these strategies. S trategy implementation can be the most demanding and time -<br>consuming part of the strategic management process. Strategic plans often end up in bottom drawer s and no <br>action is taken to implement the strategy.  <br>Strategy implementation is the realisation of str ategy and what the firm does. The successful implementation <br>of strategic decisions is widely thought to be critical to the achievement of organisational ai ms and objectives. <br>Firms face different ch allenges in their endeavour to execute a planned strategy, some of which are mentioned <br>below.  <br>7.4.1 Strategy implementation challenges  <br>• Implementation may take more time than was originally planned.  <br>• Activities to im plement strategy are ineffectively coordin ated.  <br>• Other activities and crises may take attention away f rom implementation.  <br>• Key implementation tasks may be poorly defined.  <br>Small -firm managers need to be aware of the factors that may deter them from realising their plan because of <br>failed implementatio n. Although they might have a plan, small -firm managers nee d to be flexible, open <br>minded and always on the lookout for the problems that may arise because of the new plan and for ways of <br>solving those problems. Wit hout successful implementation, a strategy  will remain just an idea.  <br>Discussed below are some require ments for the successful implementation of strategy.  <br>7.4.1.1 Requirements for successful strategy implementation  <br>Effective communication:  sometimes organis ational processes and systems need to be a djusted to implement <br>the selected strategy and everyone in the organisation must be brought on board. Strategy formulators need to 114 <br> communicate with the people who are involved in implementing the strategy in order to have a shared <br>understanding and therefo re make implementation easier.  <br>Unique creative skills:  creative skills are needed in order to place resources, employees and their work <br>appropriately in order to make implementation smooth.  <br>Control and feedback mec hanisms:  refined control and feedback mech anisms are needed in order to <br>enhance the operations and al ign them with business strategy. There also has to be room for the reevaluation <br>of goals and selection of a different strategy.  <br>After implementing the stra tegic plan, it needs to be revised and upd ated constantly so that it suits the <br>environmental conditio ns. Also, standards need to be set and they should be met in order to achieve the goals. <br>Managers need to evaluate employees’ performance through performan ce appraisals in order to ascertain if <br>everyone is performing as required.  <br>7.4.2 Evaluation and contr ol <br>Strategy evaluation and control are important as they assist the firm to keep track of progress in attaining <br>milestones and targets. The reason is that a continuous evaluation of strategy offers  benefits, such as allowing <br>the benchmarking of progress to  be established and monitored effectively. This creates manager and employee <br>commitment to achieve objectives. It also enables the monitoring of changes in  the external opportunities and <br>threats as  well as internal strengths and weaknesses of the firm. Eva luation and control of the strategic plan <br>will protect the business from collapse as it ensures that any errors are attended to timeously.  <br>In the end strat egic planning should enable a firm to gain  a sustainable advantage over its competitors. <br>Employee par ticipation in the strategic -planning  process is critical in the successful implementation of a <br>strategy. Through a participative strategic -planning process , employees are satisfied that their ideas  are <br>considered for problem solving and become committed an d motivated to work hard for goal achievement. By <br>helping the firm to make strategic decisions, strategic planning reduces the probability of business fail ure, <br>especially in small firms, and accele rates the chances of new product development.  <br>Research has shown that firms that utilised strategic planning were better positioned to pursue growth <br>opportunities. Strategic planners were more confident about their  future growth prospects than non -strategic <br>planners were. Regular strategic planners we re more prepa red in times of economic crisis and were therefore <br>less affected by the economic conditions than non -regular planners were.  <br>7.5 CONCLUSION  <br>Small firms can make use of the strategic management model as it also involves the management tools tha t <br>lead to succ ess. In employing the template, small firms can also use the strategy -as-practice approach, which <br>is more appropriate for small firms because it focuses on  the day -to-day activities that take place in the <br>business. The strategic -planning temp late will assi st small businesses achieve their goals and therefore ensure <br>survival and much needed growth, especially in emerging economies.  <br>REVIEW QUESTIONS  <br>7.1 What a re the advantages of a well -developed plan?  <br>7.2 Describe the strategic -planning process.  115 <br> 7.3 Explain why informal planning is deemed to be best suited to small firms.  <br>7.4 Distinguish between formal and informal planning.  <br>7.5 Discuss the benefits of formal planning.  <br>7.6 Describe the benefits of strategy evaluation and control.  <br>7.7 Define and explain the st rategy -as-practice approach and its relevance to small firms.  <br>7.8 What are the implementation challenges that small firms may encounter in an effort to rea lise their planned strategy?  <br>7.9 Discuss the req uirements for the successful implementation of strate gy. <br>7.10 Discuss the four strategic -planning issues that can hinder strategic -planning efforts.  <br>7.11 Briefly discuss five different types of planning.  <br>REFE RENCES  <br>Andrews, K.R. 1971.

So we started selling them, but it was <br>not really a sustainable busine ss because we just wasted all the money we made. Upon completing high school, I stopped <br>making these tees and went i nto research mode, where I did extensive research on all my favourite brands, their names, <br>logos, photo ads, and their design influences. Af ter having spent a while doing my research, I changed the name of my brand <br>from “Cheeseboy” to “Cheesegalxboy” to ac commodate women too. However, the name was too long and I felt that it wouldn’t <br>be relatable worldwide. This thought came about due to my “b igger picture” mentality  of considering things worldwide and not <br>only nationally, because that’s the level I want to  reach, that ‘international status’”.  <br>While working on his own personal brand, as well as designing for Amakipkip, Dube rebranded his 2008 s tart-up as GALXBOY <br>in 2012, and opened his first store in 2014, hitting the R1 million revenue mark. Naturally, the brand stayed loyal to two things: <br>its vision and design. GALXBOY is known for its bold and colourful designs. GALXBOY, a Pretoria -based urba n streetwear <br>brand, has made its way across borders to be stocked in stores in London.  <br>Dube is inspired by a lot of things and people. “I design every day, so my influences change every single day. I might not come <br>up with great designs all the time, but I  feel better if I design every day. I believe that eventually all those bad design days <br>become one great design when  it’s time to put everything together. It’s also a good challenge because I’m a firm believer that <br>we are here to create and learn so why no t do it every day while we still have a chance?”  118 <br> Using the connections he has gained over the years, his merchandise  has created quite a following. Some of his pieces are <br>worn by Da LES or Khuli Chana, Cassper Nyovest and Anatii. Dube says that his main co ncern is not really to get the clothing <br>popular, but to get it loved by people who are like him; people who apprecia te local streetwear. Currently the GALXBOY <br>catalogue consists of T -shirts, tank -tops and snapbacks but their design team says customers can look forward to jackets, <br>beanies, pants and sweaters, and for the ladies, handbags and nail polish.  <br>Dube has been na med one of the top 10 local fashion brands in SA in the  Sunday Times  NEXT GENERATION 2015 awards. <br>From just a small brand in Mamelodi, Dube sees GALXBOY opening more stores across the continent, bigger campaigns, <br>bigger ranges, more frequent ranges, kids l ining up to buy their products, more brands under their umbrella and just helping <br>other kids reach their dreams.  <br>Sources:  Adapted from:  <br>http://theplugmag.co/2016/05/19/galxboy -founder -thatiso -dube -discusses -the-current -state -of-streetwear/  <br>http://popularcvltvre.bl ogspot.co.za/2014/06/five -young -pioneers -of-popular -culture.html  <br>8.1 INTRODUCTION  <br>The entrepreneur wears many hats. These include leader, m anager, strategist and knowledge centre of the <br>business. From the above  case study , Mamelodi -born entrepreneur Thatiso Dube displays admirable <br>entrepreneurial traits such as creativity, passion, a genuine concern for customers and being driven by his <br>vision. In order to do this successfully the entrepreneur needs to have a skill set th at will allow for this. As is <br>evident in the  case study  above, it is important fo r an entrepreneur to possess certain skills to ensure the <br>success of any entrepreneurial venture. Dube displays impo rtant entrepreneurial skills such as networking, an <br>ability to understand the market and creativity. Unlike aptitudes and in -born talents, s kills can be learned, <br>developed and improved through concerted and consistent efforts of self -development. It is imp ossible for the <br>entrepreneur to know it all. However, entrepreneurs can make a concerted effort to constantly develop their <br>skill set.  <br>This chapter introduces the skills that an entrepreneur needs to succeed in starting and running a business <br>venture. Entr epreneurial skills are defined to provide an overall understanding of the contents of the chapter. <br>The entrepreneur is responsible for vario us tasks in the venture and these are related to the skills that the <br>entrepreneur needs to have. The importance of a  good combination of skills, expertise and aptitudes is <br>discussed. Entrepreneurial competencies are often used to differentiate between succ essful and unsuccessful <br>entrepreneurs. From this discussion, the main groups of skills required by entrepreneurs are  discussed. The <br>discussion moves to management skills for entrepreneurs and how certain skills can be used to execute the <br>management functio ns. The discussion moves to entrepreneurial skills and striking a balance between learning <br>and doing the actual task s. Entrepreneurial leadership and then networking, essential to an entrepreneur, are <br>discussed. The chapter ends by highlighting  emotional intelligence  as part of the entrepreneur’s skill set as a <br>tool for success.  <br>8.2 ENTREP RENEURIAL SKILLS DEFINED  <br>Entrepreneurship provides people with a means of livelihood, existence, self -actualisation,  fulfilment, <br>satisfaction and general wellbeing. To practise entrepreneurship well, one must apply energy, passion towards <br>the creation and implementation of creativ e ideas and solutions (Kuratko & Hodgetts, 2004: 30). <br>Entrepreneurial skills are part of a wider set of leadership and management skills needed in Small Medium <br>Enterprises (SMEs).  119 <br> Skills may be defined as proficiency, facility, or dexterity that is acquire d or developed through training or <br>experience (Merriam -Webster, 2017).  <br>While the most commo n debate around entrepreneurship centres on whether entrepreneurs are born or made, <br>the concept of skills in entrepreneurship implies that t here is room for learning  certain aspects about <br>entrepreneurial practice.  <br>8.3 ENTREPRENEURIAL TASKS  <br>When starting a business, the entrepreneur is often the all -in-one leader –manager, administrator and funder in <br>the business. Many entrepreneurs are not prep ared for other roles beyo nd idea generation and creativity. <br>Mmako (2016: 166) describes the tasks detailed in  Table 8.1  that entrepreneurs have to perform.  <br>8.4 SKILLS, EXPERTISE AND APTITUDES  <br>Rankhumise (2013: 6) attributes a combination of features to the success of entrepreneurs. A good <br>combination of these features will help entr epreneurs in their busine ss ventures. These features are described <br>in Table 8.2 . <br>Table 8.1 Entrepreneur ial leadership tasks  <br>Entrepreneurial <br>leadership tasks  Description of tasks  <br>Creating compel ling <br>vision  The entrepreneurial leader creates a convincing vision of where the business should be. This <br>attracts followers who would like t o share in realising this  vision for the business.  <br>Laying founding values  Founding values are important in determin ing whether people are a good fit for the business or <br>not. The entrepreneurial leader establishes this in an effort to guide business decisi ons and <br>actions.  <br>Attracting sure <br>followers  Followers buy into the business  idea and often invest their buy -in throu gh employment. The <br>entrepreneur should attract the right followers with the correct fit for the business who are <br>committed to ensuring busin ess success.  <br>Managing self and <br>leading others  The entrepreneur is not an a utocratic leader who micro -manages follow ers. Good <br>entrepreneurial leaders manage themselves and guide, inspire, reassure, empower and <br>motivate their followers.  <br>Promoting creativit y <br>and innovation  Creativity is the engine that keeps the entrepreneurial ve nture going. Creativity and <br>commercial in novation are encouraged in the entrepreneurial venture.  <br>Creating flexible work <br>structures  Entrepreneurship is an unpredictable and uncertai n field. Flexible work structures are <br>encouraged to allow flow of ideas in the organisation.  <br>Source:  Mmako (2016)  120 <br> Table 8.2 Skills, expertise and aptitudes.  <br>Skills  Manual work can be learned. Skills are related to a craft, trade or job that requires ma nual dexterity or <br>specialised training in which a person has competence and experience.  <br>Expertise  Refers to special sk ills or knowledge in a particular area of special isation. Expertise can be acquired through <br>work experience and knowledge gained from tra ining.  <br>Aptitude  Aptitudes relate to the inborn patterns of behaviour responsive to stimuli. Aptitudes may be specific talents <br>people have.  <br>Source:  Rankhumise (2013: 6)  <br> <br>It is also important for entrepreneurs to be introspective to understand their own str engths and weaknesses.  <br>8.5 ENTREPRENEURIAL COMPETENCIES  <br>In simple terms, competence refers to capability. Competency i s the capability of an individu al to do <br>something adequately.  <br>Entrepreneurial competencies are the characteristics associated with success fully starting a new venture. These <br>competencies are described as the characteristics of a person that result in effec tive action or superior <br>perform ance (Nuthall, 2006; Colombo & Grilli, 2005).  <br>When entrepreneurs have a good set of entre -preneurial compet encies they perform tasks successfully. <br>Therefore, competencies are useful in practically transforming knowledge, skil ls and attitude (Kaur & Bains, <br>2013).  Table 8.3  by McBer and Co (1986) describ es common entrepreneurial compe tencies which are <br>common in successful entrepreneurs.  <br>8.5.1 Main groups of skills required by entrepreneurs  <br>The Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD, 2014: 1) states that the greater <br>emphasis placed on  entrepreneurial skills has created improved agreement of entrepreneurial abilities and <br>competencies. They identify three main groups of s kills required by entrepreneurs as described in  Table 8.3 . <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 121 <br> Table 8.3  Competenc ies of successful entrepreneurs  <br>Proactiveness  <br>1 Initiative  Does things before they are asked to or are forced  by events.  <br>2 Assertiveness  Confronts problems with others directly.  <br>Tells others what they have to do.  <br>Achievement orientation  <br>3 Sees and acts  on <br>opportunities  Seizes unusual opportunities to start a new business and obtain funding, land, <br>work, space o r assistance.  <br>4 Efficiency orientation  Looks for, or finds ways of, doing things faster or at a lower c ost. <br>5 Concern for high -quality  work  States a desire to produce or sell a top -quality or better -quality product or service.  <br>6 Systematic planning  Brea ks large tasks down into sub tasks and sub goals; anticipates obstacles, <br>evaluates alternatives.  <br>Commit ment to others  <br>7 Commitment to work contr act Makes a personal sacrifice or extends an extraordinary effort to complete a job, <br>pitches in with workers o r works in their place to get the job done.  <br>8 Recognises the importance of <br>business relationships  Acts to build rapport or friendly rel ationships  with customers, sees interpersonal <br>relationships as a fundamental business resource, places long -term goodwil l over <br>short -term gain.  <br>Source:  Nieuwenhuizen (2008)  <br>It is worthwhile noting that while these competencies may be general, entrepreneur s need to master particular <br>skills in their specific trade or sector. Knowledge in these areas often improves their cred ibility among their <br>followers.  <br>8.6 MANAGEMENT SKILLS F OR ENTREPRENEURS  <br>The entrepreneur has to fulfil the intertwined roles of managemen t, leaders hip and entrepreneurship. These <br>roles often overlap and are enacted simultaneously. Entrepreneurs often wear t he manager hat in their <br>businesses until the business grows big enough to employ qualified managers. With what are often limited <br>resourc es in the entrepreneurial venture, on top of his other tasks the entrepreneur has to execute the <br>management tasks of pla nning, organising, leading and controlling.  <br>Suteskvi (2009) defines man agerial skills as the knowledge and ability of the individual in a manageri al <br>position to fulfil some specific managerial activities or tasks.  <br>Robert Katz (1974), in what is considered his seminal work, identified three skills that are essential for <br>succes sful management processes. These are discussed next. (See also  Table 8.4 .) 122 <br> Table 8.4 Management skills required by entrepreneurs  <br>Type of skil l Encompassing factors  <br>Technical  Communication, environment monitoring, problem solving, technology implementation and us e, <br>interpersonal, organisational skills.  <br>Business <br>management  Planning and goal setting, decision making, human resources management, marketing, finance, <br>accounting, customer relations, quality control, negotiation, business launch, growth management, <br>comp liance with regulations skills.  <br>Personal <br>entrepreneurial  Self-control and discipline, risk management, innovation, persistence, leade rship, change <br>management, network building, strategic thinking.  <br>Source:  European Union (2014: 1)  <br>8.6.1 Technical skills  <br>Technical skills refer to the knowledge and ability of entrepreneurial managers to do the actual job. These <br>skills are gained through e ducation, training or experience. Technical skills are practical and are also called <br>hard skills. This means that the abi lity to perform these skills is directly related to the job at hand. Technical <br>skills can also be measured, unlike softer skills, such as conceptual skills and interpersonal skills.  <br>For example, a mechanic needs to know about cars in order to diagnose prob lems when someone brings in <br>their car for fixing. An accountant needs to know accounting principles and practices in order to do accoun ting. <br>8.6.2 Conceptual skills  <br>Conceptual skills refer to the abstract thinking abilities of the entrepreneurial manager. This refers to higher -<br>level thinking, which requires analysis of ideas, processes and predictive abilities. For the entrepreneur, <br>conce ptual skills will often be used when strategising for the business, planning direction and setting goals <br>that need to be achieved for the business’s sustained existence. Conceptual skills allow entrepreneurs to solve <br>problems, implement ideas and create bu siness processes.  <br>For example, an entrepreneur might come up with a new process of capturing customer preferences based o n <br>the items they view on an online shopping website and tailoring these to the business’s offerings.  <br>8.6.3 Interpersonal management ski lls <br>The entrepreneur will often have to work with people. Interpersonal management skills are related to the <br>entrepreneur ’s human relations skills. Though intellectual ability is important, it is also essential for the <br>entrepreneur to be able to relate to people inside and outside the business. These interpersonal skills are <br>important as the entrepreneur has to draw employee s, funders and other parties to his vision for the business. <br>Without good interpersonal skills, this is not possible. Entrepreneurs nee d to evaluate their interpersonal skills <br>from time to time.  <br>As an example, employees in an entrepreneurial venture might prefer working with one of the co -owners of <br>the business based on the fact that he is not rude, listens to their concerns and inspires performance in the <br>team.  123 <br> 8.7 MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS  <br>Entrepreneurs will have to manage themselves and what they choose to inv est their time and limited resources <br>in. In addition, they will also have to manage others in the business. Like leadership, managemen t includes <br>understanding the resources in the busi ness and directing how they will be used. The four basic management <br>functions can assist the entrepreneur in doing this. The management functions are planning, organising, <br>leading and controlling. (See also  Table 8.5 .) <br>Table 8.5 Management functions and skills the entrepreneur shoul d develop  <br>Management <br>functions  Description of func tion Skills to develop  <br>Planning  Creating a detailed strategy to achieve  the <br>goals of the organisation  Time management, creativity, goal setting, setting <br>priorities, trade specific knowledge  <br>Organising  Coordinating resources to ensure the <br>successful execution of tasks  Coordination skills, implementation planning, role <br>assessm ent, analytical thinking, time management  <br>Leading  Providing direction to employees to ensure <br>the successful achievement of organisati onal <br>goals  Decision making, training and coaching, <br>communication , delegating, problem solving, <br>emotional intelligence  <br>Controlling  Evaluating the achievement of goals against <br>the set standard  Evaluation skills, impartiality, monitoring, critical <br>thinking, taking corrective action  <br>Source:  Erasmus, Strydom & Rudansky -Kloppers (2013)  <br>8.7.1 Skills learning versus skills “doing”  <br>Entrepreneurship is fundamentally practical. Academic theories related to entrepreneurship have been <br>criticised for being too theoreti cal for what is mainly a practical  field. The Association of Chartered <br>Accountants (ACCA, 2016) advises entrepreneurs to f ind a balance between learning skills necessary to build <br>successful businesses and applying these skills. They provide the following g uidelines for applying skills in <br>entrepreneurial ventures:  <br>1. Ensure that more time is spent actually conducting business, ra ther than spending time predominantly <br>in classrooms, incubators and discussion groups.  <br>2. Look for mentorship and practical programmes th at can balance academic qualificat ions.  <br>3. Build an entrepreneurial team to balance your limitations and improve your knowled ge. <br>4. Be curious and willing to learn. Know what competitors are doing as this should help you streamline <br>processes in your own business  and reach more customers.  <br>5. View fa ilure as a skill as it also plays a key role in defining your future success.  <br>8.7.2 Entr epreneurial leadership and skills  <br>An entrepreneur exploits opportunities for profits. However, the role of the entrepreneur in the bus iness <br>extends beyond this. An entr epreneur also has to provide direction and leadership to his followers. Leadership <br>and e ntrepreneurship are not synonymous. Being a good entrepreneur does not make one a good leader and <br>vice versa. Leadership is the abilit y of the entrepreneur to lead foll owers towards a desired vision.  124 <br> No entrepreneur is born with the perfect skill set. Rabi nowitz (2013) provides the following guidelines in <br>choosing a leadership style.  <br>• Start with yourself.  Entrepreneurs need to be introspe ctive. This entails a realistic assessment and <br>evaluation of their  weaknesses and strengths. Knowing oneself as a leader a nd entrepreneur is important <br>as it allows you to make improvements in your personality and business.  <br>• Think about the needs of the busi ness.  We grow as people and it is only natural to grow as an entre preneur. <br>You can adapt an initial entrepreneurial style and adapt it along the way. The leadership style should, <br>however, be in line with the needs of the business.  <br>Observe and learn from ot her leaders.  Find a mentor. This can be someone you admire and who  is <br>accessible to you. You should not strive to become a  carbon copy of your mentor. The goal is to <br>learn from him or her and determine the kind of leader you want to be.  8.8 NETWORKING  <br>In the world of business it is often said that “it is not what you kn ow but who you know”. This statement in <br>itself relays the  importance of networking. Businesses do not operate in isolation. For a business to grow it is <br>important for the entrepreneur to esta blish, build and grow mutually beneficial relationships. This is called <br>networking.  <br>CASE STUDY:  The young brains behind Re Kindle Learning  <br>Our society teaches us to spend a lot of time looking out there for success, but the ability to drive yourself to your  full potential <br>starts internally with personal mastery.  <br>Rapelang  Rabana  is the founder and CEO of ReKindle Learning, an e ducation technology company. Right after obtaining <br>her bachelor’s degree in business science and honours in computer science from the University of Cape Town, Rapelang <br>Rabana cofounded her own compan y, Yeigo Communications. Yeigo is internationally recogni sed for its pioneering <br>innovations in mobile VoIP and IP communications. In 2008, Yeigo partnered with the Telfree group of companies,  allowing it <br>to provide a full range of telecommunications servic es. <br>When she started, Rabana didn’t really have the exper ience of running a business, however, she knew that she wanted to <br>come up with solutions to some of the problems she deemed important.  She didn’t want to be in a work environment where <br>she would be r estricted to choose what she wanted. For Rapelang, ReKind le Learning speaks to her dream of making learning <br>easier, accessible, and more effective to South Africans. She believes that the det erioration of South Africa’s education system <br>has undermined the much -needed process of what she thinks learning should be . “It is kind of like rekindling a fire. ReKindle <br>Learning is about re -igniting a desire to learn,” says Rapelang. ReKindle Learning i s a learning technology company that <br>provides digital learning ex periences that improve learning efficiencies to deliver s tronger performance at school.  <br>Despite her own privileged learning, she could not help but wonder about the inadequacies of South Afri ca’s education system. <br>She imagined an education system where all  South Africans had access to the type of good education she had. The founding <br>of ReKindle Learning transported her imagination to reality – she imagined an integrated learning process where young South <br>Africans could easily interact with each other about assignments, homework and ultimately make “learning a lif estyle”. <br>Rapelang says that she never imagined she would be an entrepreneur but nevertheless became one at age 22.  <br>Rabana was featured  on the cover of Forbes Africa, and named Entrepreneur for the Wo rld by the World Entrepreneurship <br>Forum. She was selected  as a Global Shaper by the World Economic Forum and was invited to join their annual meeting in <br>Davos, all by the age of 30. Rabana sa ys she now sits on different boards and supports other businesses  as a consultant and <br>manages projects.  <br>Kenya and Senegal might be leading the way in mobile learning, but Rapelang’s ReKindle Learning and other South African <br>companies in the tech learning s pace are sure to bridge this gap pretty quickly. Delivering a tal k on mobile learning at TEDx <br>Cape Town, Rapelang made a p rofound statement that educators need to seriously consider.  <br>She asserted:  125 <br> If we truly wish to address our educational development cha llenges on this continent, including the need to skill at significant <br>scale, we must ask how to begin articulating a mobil e learning experience that effectively imparts core skills and knowledge <br>that improves organisational performance that gets more kids through school.  <br>Sources:  Adapted from:  <br>http://www.702.co.za/articles/5071/meet -the-brains -behind -rekindle -learning -an-education -technology -company  <br>http://www.fabulouswoman.co.za/news%20and%20events%20article%2019.html  <br>Questions  <br>1. With reference to Rapelang Rabana’s story, discus s the three skills that are essential f or <br>successful management processes.  <br>2. Rapelang Rabana displays several competencies o f successful entrepreneurs. Describe <br>these competencies.  <br>3. Do you think Rapelang Rabana displays good entrepreneurial skills?  <br>Entreprene urial networking is defined as “… forgi ng new social ties that lead to information and resources, <br>and, ultimately, increas ed value creation for the venture,” (Pollack, Coy, Green & Davis, 2015: 817). This <br>definition highlights the importance of social ties  in helping to create increased value i n a business. It neglects, <br>however, two important principles of networking, which a re reciprocity and maintenance.  <br>8.8.1 Reciprocity and maintenance  <br>Nieuwenhuzen (2008: 117) assert that networks are built firstly on r eciprocity. This means that the relatio nship <br>should be one of “give and take”. Networks should be mutually beneficial. You  should be prepared to give <br>something to the other person in return for what they provide you with.  <br>Maintenance mainly relates to the fact that networks are not mandatory re lationships. If broken as a result of <br>neglect they are hard to repair.  <br>8.8.2 Guidel ines for networking  <br>Rittscher (2012) provides the following guidelines entrepreneurs should practise to strengthen their <br>networking ef forts:  <br>8.8.2.1 Start with a plan  <br>Networking should not be left to chance. Ask yourself questions such as “Who do I need to  connect with to <br>be successful? Which groups or companies would be beneficial to my success? How can I connect with the <br>relevant peopl e?” It is important to write down your plan and prioritise thereafter. Set priorities weekly, <br>monthly and annually and mak e a commitment to achieve your networking goals.  <br>8.8.2.2 Be selective with your efforts  <br>Learn to use social networking strategically. For ent repreneurs time is a commodity that should be used wisely. <br>Choose who you reach out to. Target your efforts towards  connections that will help your business grow.  <br>8.8.2.3 Learn to work events  <br>Attend relevant events and seminars. Make sure your name is well  displayed and that you understand your <br>elevator pitch, which is a short outline description of a business idea or product covering only critical aspects <br>of it. Introduce yourself to a small group of people. Do this often until you become accustomed  to it. 126 <br> 8.8.2.4 Make real connections  <br>The goal should not be the number of business cards or contacts you can get. Focus o n quality and not quantity. <br>In your interactions be honest and genuine. It is important to bear in mind that a contact is not a connec tion, <br>but a relationship is.  <br>8.8.2.5 Build and keep your current connection  <br>Social media has made networking easier. Profe ssional networking sites such as LinkedIn can be used to build <br>business contact information. Learn to update your profile on social ne tworks,  share useful information <br>without spamming followers, congratulate people on their achievements and make connection s. <br>8.8.2.6 Pay it forward  <br>Learn to help other people achieve their goals too. Success often comes when we help others. Introduce peopl e <br>to relevant people in their networks, recommend people you trust, offer assistance where and when you can <br>and make sugge stions that can help others improve their business too. Networking requires sincerity and care <br>and practising networking in this manne r will set you apart.  <br>8.9 EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE (EQ)  <br>Entrepreneurs often have their plates full with things they need to handle. Although an entrepreneur’s ability <br>to think and reason is important to a venture, emotional intelligence is a distinguishing c haracte ristic of <br>successful entrepreneurs. Emotional intelligence is defined as perceiving, using, understanding and manag ing <br>emotional information (Caruso & Salovey, 2004). Entrepreneurs will be confronted with conflict, challenging <br>situations and dilemma s in th eir business journeys. Emotional intelligence is an inherent part of our <br>personality. However, through changed habi ts and behaviour, emotional intelligence can be improved.  <br>Sullivan (2016), offers the following advice on how entrepreneurs can improv e their  EQ: <br>• Become more self -aware:  take time to meditate, develop a larger emotional vocabulary and regularly stop <br>to ref lect and check in with yourself.  <br>• Manage your emotions:  learn what your emotional reactions to situations are. Develop strategies to <br>counter n egative reactions  <br>• Develop greater empathy:  learn to ask yourself how it would feel to be in someone else’s position . This is <br>done by developing greater presence and curiosity about people.  <br>• Manage your relationships better:  manage your relationships by remaining curious about people’s <br>motivation and communicating your desires for your business.  <br>8.10 CONCLUSION  <br>In this c hapter, the entrepreneurial skills required for successful business start -ups and operations were <br>discussed . These skills include poss essing certain entrepreneurial competencies, networking, emotional <br>intelligence as well as entrepreneurial leadership.  <br>Even though the age -old entrepreneurship argument is whether entrepreneurs are born or made, it is undeniable <br>that skills can be learned.  127 <br> Today, many entrepreneurial opportunities exist. Lack of skills often leads to failure. The importance of a <br>good combinat ion of skills, expertise and aptitudes is essential. This combination should be evaluated based <br>on the entr epreneurial opportunities a nd talents of the individual.  <br>Since it is established that entrepreneurs wear many hats in a business, management and lead ership cannot be <br>left out of the entrepreneur’s skill set. Though entrepreneurial ventures are set up diffe rently, many <br>management and  leadership functions are still relevant and applicable to entrepreneurial ventures.  <br>An entrepreneur’s skill set is incomp lete without the ability to network. Networking is essential for business <br>growth and exposure. Guidelines f or improved networking are provided in the chapter to assist entrepreneurs <br>in establishing meaningful and beneficial relationships for the business.  <br>The chapter concludes with a discussion on emotional intelligence. Since entrepreneurs have a lot to <br>coordi nate, they need to be emoti onally equipped for their entrepreneurial journey.  <br>REFLECTION ACTIVITY  <br>You are an entrepreneurship major at university. Ha ving read this chapter, your understanding of the entrepreneur and skills <br>has grown. Many entrepreneurial ventures in South Africa fai l for many reasons; the major ones being access to funding and <br>poor ski lls. Knowing what you know, think of ways entrepren eurs can develop their own skills to learn to manage and grow <br>their own businesses successfully.  <br>Please note:  There are no right or wr ong answers, just your substantiated opinion.  <br>REVIEW QUESTIONS  <br>8.1 Provide a definition of the term “skills”.  <br>8.2 Tabulate  the different entrepreneurial leadership tasks.  <br>8.3 Differentiate between skills, expertise and aptitudes.  <br>8.4 Which skills are essen tial for a successful management process in the business?  <br>8.5 Provide g uidelines an entrepreneur can use when choosing a l eadership style.  <br>8.6 Explain what emotional intelligence is.  <br>ACTIVITY 1  <br>Take the following self -assessment activity called Entrepreneu rial potential self -assessment.

The body of knowledge on creativity and <br>innovation has increased exponentially . <br>Both the developed and emerging economies of the world are experiencing a shift in emphasis from generating <br>and making available new kn owledge to the application of knowledge in novel value -adding ways that <br>differentiate competing entrepreneurs.  <br>South Af rica’s National Development Plan 2030 is discussed as an example of a context in which creativity <br>and innovation is stimulated. This is f ollowed by a reflection on myths and misconceptions that create <br>entrepreneurial blind spots preventing them from notici ng idea sources or generating ideas and turning these <br>into value. Business is portrayed as a value -adding entity operating in a system wh ere innovation comprises <br>both value creation and value realisation.  <br>Furthermore, this chapter builds on the overwhelmin g body of research evidence that entrepreneurs are people <br>with the appetite to start and maintain businesses that are competitive, provid e value in the form of new <br>products and services while creating jobs and making valuable contributions to economic grow th and <br>socioeconomic development. This chapter emphasises creativity in general across all activities of the small <br>entrepreneurial enterp rise and specifically explores the role of innovation in setting up sustainable firms with <br>the innovator/entrepreneur b eing that causal ingredient in the entrepreneurial equation.  131 <br> 9.2 ENTREPRENEURS AS VALUE CREATORS  <br>There are different routes to becoming a n entrepreneur. Both entrepreneurs and innovators may be people <br>with exceptional abilities to conceptualise and exploit op portunities. It is possible to be an entrepreneur <br>without being an innovator. It is also possi ble to be an innovator without being an entrepreneur.  <br>When we see fruit vendors next to the road we may not be looking at innovators or entrepreneurs because they  <br>may be working for someone else who saw the opportunity of selling fruit at a particular spot  next to a <br>particular road at a particul ar time. We might, however, be looking at an entrepreneur who had enough <br>confidence to purchase some fruit with the purpos e of reselling the fruit within a reasonable time frame and <br>in that way recover their expenses  and hopefully make a bit of a profit.  <br>Innovation offers an alternative route to entrepreneurship, which requires more than a buy -and-sell approach <br>to business. I t is about conceptualising and producing something that has not been done in a particular cont ext <br>before or doing something differentl y and accepting the pioneering challenge because there may not be <br>roadmaps available for this journey. In the case of our fruit vendor, creativity and innovation -driven <br>entrepreneurs are those who create novel ways i n which to create, offer and deliver the ir products, or who <br>source these in innovative new ways or use innovative ways to add value to their fruit. Think of a fru it vendor <br>with a solar -energy -driven cooling device that can sell fruit and cold beverages in the hot sun while the other <br>fruit vendor s in the vicinity are trying to compete in conventional ways, which may be to reduce the price of <br>the goods too far to mak e any profit, thus leaving them without cash to invest in the next parcel of fruit. Our <br>innova tive entrepreneur will keep the fruit fr esh for longer, have less waste and make a profit if the numbers <br>are done correctly.  <br>9.2.1 Causes of entrepreneur reluctan ce to innovate  <br>In conditions of uncertainty, most rational people would adopt a conservative o r safe stance to emerging new <br>opportunit ies. Entrepreneurs, however, are people who see the same as other people but prefer to think about <br>it differently. Success ful entrepreneurs tend to be those people who are not blind to the risks and uncertainties <br>but take calculated risks based on availabl e knowledge, while anticipating that the rewards will meet or exceed <br>their expectations. Unfortunately for the entrepreneu r, in some economies sufficient quality information may <br>not be available to assist the entrepr eneur in informed decision making, which  increases their uncertainty and, <br>therefore, risks.  <br>Risk is a factor in any organisation today and in most large organisat ions one would find risk -management <br>programmes. Small emerging entrepreneurs, however, have fe wer and less sophisticated means of deal ing <br>with risk, which may explain why the rate of entrepreneurial activity in South Africa is very low for a <br>developing eco nomy.  <br>Despite a marginal increase in South Africa’s entrepreneurial activity over 10 years, th e Global <br>Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) Report 2014 shows a staggering decline of 34 per cent and claims that the <br>perception of opportunities to start a business and the confidence in one’s own abilities to do so remains <br>alarmingly low compared to other su b-Saharan countries. The typical South A frican entrepreneur is between <br>25 and 44 years of age, is male, lives in an urban area, is involved in the retail and whol esale sector and has a <br>secondary or tertiary level of education. Business discontinuance level s exceed those of new start -ups, <br>resulti ng in subsequent job losses. Reasons relating to lack of finance and poor profitability are cited as well <br>as an inadequate ly educated workforce, inefficient government bureaucracy, high crime levels and onerous <br>labou r laws (GEM Report, 2014).  <br>Most successf ul entrepreneurs have had to conquer uncertainty and risk at some point, resulting in a better <br>understanding of entreprene urial complexities and heightened confidence levels. South Africa has world -class <br>entrepreneur s who thrive on understanding technical and business risks, and have developed mechanisms to <br>share and manage risks, complexity and resources to confidently enter  challenging yet rewarding 132 <br> entrepreneurial occupations. Aspiring entrepreneurs can learn from these role models and available knowledg e <br>to overcome some of the challenges of entrepreneurship in developing economies.  <br>9.3 WHAT IS INNOVATION AND WHY IT MATTER S <br>9.3.1 Innovation economy perspectives – global and local  <br>Decades ago a world -renowned management scholar, Peter Drucker, emphasised innovation as the tool of <br>entrepreneurs and the means by which entrepreneurs exploit change as an opportunity for a differ ent business <br>or service.  <br>Since Drucker’s claim, the innovat ion landscape has experienced significant changes, such as the introduction  <br>of the internet, mobile technologies, social networking and related force multipliers that have shifted <br>ownership and acc ess to individuals and developing economies where this was unthinkable before. The Fourth <br>Industrial Revolution is a phrase used by Sc hwab (Schwab, 2016) at the World Economic Forum (WEF) to <br>emphasise the increasing speed and impact of technological advanc ement, which is affecting everything <br>around us and everythi ng that we do. The Second Machine Age is a term used by two MIT professors in their <br>book, articles and videos with the same title, in which they discuss and provide examples of specific <br>technologie s that are likely to have even more impact on our lives tha n steam and electricity (Brynjolfsson & <br>McAfee, 2014).  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 133 <br> Figure 9.1 Accelerat ing growth in technology  <br> <br>Source:  Adapted from Brynjolfsson & McAfee (2014: 171)  <br> <br>Futurist Thomas Frey cites the Consumer  Electronics Show (CES) held annually in Las Vegas, and othe r <br>innovation exhibition platforms to alert his global readership of new te chnologies that are changing the world. <br>Frey makes the point that around 3 600 CES exhibitors (including 375 start -ups) dr aw around 170 000 <br>attendees and that tens of thousands priva te meetings are being conducted in the background  “forcing more <br>deals to b e cut in a shorter period of time than virtually any other event on the planet” (Frey, 2015). Examples <br>of new technologies  with disruptive potential include the following:  <br>• Drones  <br>• 3D printing  <br>• Cloud computing  <br>• Robotics  <br>• Bio-engineering  <br>These examples are just the tip of the iceberg, or as they say in Africa, the ears of the hippo. Individually and <br>collectively they have the poten tial to bring about creative destruction, which is an innova tion theory <br>postulated by economist Joseph Schumpeter (Schumpeter, 2004).  <br>While these technologies may be created and admired by technology enthusiasts, it is their use for creating <br>and maintainin g a competitive advantage that really matters for entreprene urs. The harsh reality is that a well -<br>established business may be wiped ou t by competitors using new technologies and that entrepreneurs can no <br>134 <br> longer ignore technology in their quests to gain com petitive advantage or to become technology wise when <br>others use innovative new technology against them.  <br>The pursuit of innovation for entrepreneurial purposes requires that a business be acknowledged by <br>entrepreneurs as being part of a competitive value -linked system in which innovation could take place <br>anywhere in  the system. Entrepreneurs use enterprise processes to create value by gen erating goods and <br>services that others value enough to pay the entrepreneur sufficiently to make a profit, as shown in the  RV-<br>arrow in  Figure 9.2 . RV stands for relevance based on value and the other RV -arrows also indicate value based <br>on linkages. All work togeth er for the entrepreneur to create a sustainable enterprise. Businesses fai l when <br>value based on linkages destroys more value than it creates. This interconnected system provides innovation <br>opportu nities beyond simply thinking of entrepreneurship as the pro duction of goods and services. <br>Technologies mentioned in the fourth Indust rial Revolution and second machine age discussions above are <br>more accessible to entrepreneurs than ever before. In practic al terms, the entrepreneur could create or modify <br>technology : for better access to changes in the remote external environment; to use resources on more <br>favourable terms; or to deliver goods and services more efficiently. It should be clear from this basic simplified <br>value -linked model that entrepreneurial creativit y and innovation could benefit from: greater awareness of the <br>global innov ation landscape; opportunities for leveraging technology; and enhancing the relevance of the <br>entrepreneurial enterprise ba sed on its value creation.  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 135 <br> Figure 9.2 Business as a value -linked system  <br> <br> <br>Innovation in emerging economies does not take p lace in a vacuum and entrepreneurs need to capitalise on <br>the interrelatedness between these economies and the interconnect edness of technologies between them. <br>Business relationship structures across the world  have been changing significantly in recent year s, resulting <br>in: fragmented production processes; increasing diversity of business models; the involvement of multiple <br>players who are distributed worldwide; and the reallocation of capital flows around the g lobe. Some <br>developing countries have benefited f rom this trend, which is changing innovation markets as a consequence. <br>India and China are examples of developing economie s in which future scenarios indicate a firm commitment <br>towards, and investment in, inc reasing the number of researchers, PhDs in scien ce and engineering, patents <br>and scientific publications. Investment in science and engineering and technology related to i nnovation is <br>anticipated to increase by 50 per cent to 74 per cent, which suggests sig nificant and probably overambitious <br>growth in in novation capacity, competitiveness and being integrated in the global innovation landscape. <br>Instead of adapting innovation  models from the developed world, entrepreneurs in emerging economies are <br>changing the  nature of innovation by introducing innovations  with the aim of reaching the huge markets <br>represented by China and India. Reverse innovation of products by emerging econ omies can be done at lower <br>costs. Innovative models in distribution, commercialisation  and the marketing chain are forcing the <br>restruc turing of multinational businesses. This type of innovation, together with lower -priced R&D costs, <br>make it attractive for developed countries to access the capacity of emerging economies. At the same time it <br>also creates opportunities for developing econom ies to climb the value chain to become R&D providers in <br>136 <br> complex innovation areas while simultaneously improving the educat ional levels of those involved. With <br>better education innovators and entrepreneurs can  increase income, which means they have more to invest. <br>This results in growth in the emerging economy in the direction of becoming a developed economy itself. It <br>is clea r that performance in science, technology and innovation is being strengthened to incr ease the share in <br>high-technology products and s ervices to grow India and China’s economies (Wolf et al., 2011).  <br>In South Africa innovation is also seen as the capacity t o generate, acquire and apply knowledge to advance <br>economic and social purposes and th at when innovation is supported by government re sources, it needs to <br>extend beyond any commercial and economic indicators and should affect local community development an d <br>sustainable futures (Wild, 2015). As mentioned before, South Africa’s National Devel opment Plan (NDP) <br>2030 sets the policy direction  for the future of innovation and entrepreneurship in South Africa. The NDP <br>2030 executive summary refers to innovation 70  times to emphasise the progress required in three priority <br>areas, namely: raising emp loyment through faster economic growth; improvin g the quality of education; skills <br>development and innovation; as well as building the capability of the state to play a d evelopmental, <br>transformative role.  <br>Other innovation references in the NDP 2030 (RSA, 2 013) include the following:  <br>• South Africa needs t he active support of all citizens and leadership in all sectors to put the country’s <br>collective interests ahead of narrow,  short -term goals and radically improve government performance. In <br>most cases it is ab out getting the basics right and implementing go vernment programmes while holding <br>people accountable for the actions and finding innovative solutions to complex challenge s. <br>• Science and technology revolutionise the way goods and services are produced and tr aded. South Africa <br>needs to use its knowledge an d innovative products to compete and expand its global presence in both <br>new and traditional sectors. Innovation is necessa ry. <br>• South Africa needs to sharpen its innovation edge and continue to contribute to gl obal scientific and <br>technological advancement. A lso Africans should be able to access and use knowledge effectively.  <br>• South Africa can create 11 million jobs by 2030 by: i mproving economic policy coordination and <br>implementation; building partnerships betwee n the public -sector business and labour to facil itate, direct <br>and promote investment in labour -intensive areas; raising competitiveness and export earnings through <br>better  infrastructure and public services; lowering the costs of doing business; improving s kills and <br>innovation and targeting state support  for specific sectors.  <br>In addition to the NDP 2030, other national -level innovation policies link the domains of technolog y, <br>innovation and entrepreneurship, which necessitates the evolution of innovation and  entrepreneurship required <br>for stimulating devel opment in South Africa.  <br>Entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship policy in South Africa is discussed more extensively by Marc elle <br>(2015) who observes that since 1994, with the advent of a new democratic era, gov ernment has taken measures <br>to position small -business development as a key policy focus and describes milestones, such as the 1995 White <br>Paper on a national strategy for the development and promotion of small business in South Africa. Marcelle <br>(2015) also refers to the Small Enterprise Development Agenc y (SEDA) as a flagship agency created by the <br>Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) as a centralised agency for supporting  small business in South Africa <br>in 2004.  <br>Innovation and innovation policy in South Afr ica is also discussed in more detail by Marcelle  (2015) who <br>observes that government economic policy accepts that economic growth  is driven by innovation in all sectors <br>of society. Marcelle (2015) also discusses key policies and strategies to improve acces s to science and <br>technology promoting innovation : <br>• The White Paper on Science and Technology – preparing for the 21st century, Department of Arts, Culture, <br>Science and Tec hnology (DACST) (Republic of South Africa, 1996)  <br>• The national research and development  strategy (DACST, 2002) with its three policy ob jectives:  <br>– Achieving mastery of technological change in our economy and society (innovation)  <br>– Increasing investment in S outh Africa’s science base (human capital and transformation)  137 <br> – Strengthening governme nt’s science and technology system (alignment an d delivery)  <br>• Indigenous knowledge systems policy (DACST, 2004)  <br>• South Africa’s 10 -year national innovation plan, Department of Science and Technology (DST) (Naidoo, 2008) <br>which emphasises five grand challenges for South Africa:  <br>– Farmer -to-pharma value chain  to strengthen the bio economy, building on the nation’s indigenous resources <br>and expanding the knowledge base  <br>– Space sci ence and technology  <br>– Energy security  <br>– Global climate change  <br>– Global understanding of shifting human and social dynamics and the rol e of science in stimulating growth <br>and development  <br>• The Technology Innovation Act 26 of 2008  <br>9.3.2 Innovation myths and mis conceptions  <br>The preceding sections convey clear policy, strat egy and enabling mechanisms to take the country forward in <br>innovation and  entrepreneurship. The conversion of these aspirations into achievements, however, is <br>dependent on a range of factors such  as the mental models of those involved. Myths and misconcept ions about <br>innovation are based on opinions that became beliefs that may not be conducive to innovation. The following <br>are indicative of mindsets that may have to be challenged in light of the co untry’s desired future innovation <br>and entrepreneurial destina tions.  <br>9.3.2.1 Innovation is research and development (R&D)  <br>Historically this is how innovation happened. Senior management would prioritise areas for development; <br>innovation would be a top -down effort to bring this about. In the entrepreneurial world, inn ovation is often a <br>bottom -up process.  <br>9.3.2.2 Innovation is new product d evelopment  <br>Innovation is often limited to new product development. In recent years innovation is clearly being seen as <br>much more than new product development to include any facet of b usiness where innovation can make a <br>positive difference.  <br>9.3.2.3 Innovati on is brainstorming  <br>Some view innovation as the generation of new ideas. In reality most business executives can testify t hat they <br>have more ideas than they can realistically use and that the real challenge is often how to turn these ideas into <br>value. This  requires more than just creative thinking. It also requires a good understanding and knowledge of <br>the technology and inno vation landscape in which the business operates as well as sp ecific contextual factors <br>relevant to the business, such as its performan ce, its values, its ideals and relationships.  <br>9.3.2.4 Innovation can only be done by some people with the right skills  <br>There have been many gifted inventors and innovators that have m anaged to stand out in history because of <br>what they have achieved. There is growing appreciation today that different people have different skills and <br>complementary assets to contribute.  <br>9.3.2.5 Innovation can only be done by large organisations with resou rces <br>This may be true in certain industries and organisations where a lac k of resources would hamper people’s <br>ability to innovate. Technological advancements increasingly allow small entrepreneur  innovators to 138 <br> complement, or compete with larger resource -intensive organisations or do  things in ways that make them <br>attractive to b e bought by such organisations.  <br>9.3.2.6 Innovation requires a linear sequential process  <br>This may be true in environments w here nature rules but increasingly the emphasis falls on cust omised <br>processes that accommodate dynamic interaction between people work ing against time to address particular <br>challenges.  <br>By challenging their own mindsets related to innovation myths and misco nceptions, aspiring entrepreneurs <br>may become more receptive t o new ideas and let go of mindsets that may be stifling innovation.  <br>9.3.3  Sourcing ideas  <br>Previous sections dealt with policy issues and mistaken beliefs about innovation. The entrepreneur also ne eds <br>to understand that new ideas are needed for innovation. While some entrepreneurs have demonstrated their <br>abilities to come up with  new ideas by th emselves, finding ideas from other sources may also be considered. <br>The concept of open innovation suggests  that firms utilise external sources to enhance their innovation. This <br>may include building relationships with several other people an d entities such as suppliers, collaborators, <br>competitors, regulators and multiple other players to extend the range of ide a sources (Chesbrough, 2003). <br>New knowledge and technology as sources of innovation may also serve as sources for new ideas, including  <br>scientific brea kthroughs and licensing opportunities that may disrupt current markets (Bianchi, Campodall, <br>Frattini & Ver cesi, 2010).  <br>For effective sustainable sourcing of ideas a more systemic approach is proposed to build capabilities that will <br>continue  to identify and  tap into sources of ideas through innovative intelligence, which is a new focus for <br>leaders to maximise t he innovative capacity of their people (Weiss & Legrand, 2011).  <br>It is important for entrepreneurs to understand that the best ideas ma y not come from them. Other people have <br>diverse backgrounds and perspectives from which entrepreneurs may benefit and ther e are multiple channels <br>available to tap into the sources already mentioned (Rosenfeld, Wilhelmi & Harrison, 2011).  <br>9.3.4 Innovation t ypes  <br>Not all inn ovations are the same and the entrepreneur may benefit from a basic understanding of innovation <br>typologies , such as radical, incremental, modular and architectural innovation, as illustrated in  Figure 9.3 . <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 139 <br> Figure 9.3 Innovation categories  <br> <br> <br>Source:  Adapted from Henderson & Clark (1990) cited in Smith (2010)  <br>Figure 9.3  could illustrate the four types of innovation based on the flow of innovations cond ucted by an <br>entrepreneur who wanted to transport his harvest to a market on the other side of a river. When the business <br>was small, his little boat with some packing space a dded (incremental innovation) would be sufficient. Next <br>a bigger sail or an engine on the boat to go faster (modular innovation) would be necessary. Architectural <br>innovation would be if he then redesigned his ship to carry more and heavier loads. Finally r adical innovation <br>would be if he purchased an aeroplane for greater speed and loads . <br>Innovation also comes in different forms and may include: product (e.g. a new ice -cream type); process (e.g. <br>making the ice cream in a new way or moving it in a new way); service (e.g. new ways of presenting the ice <br>cream to customers); and business -mode l innovation (e.g. changing the business model for better <br>differentiation and competitiveness).  <br>9.3.5 Innovation defined  <br>Another key insight for entrepreneurs concerns the d efinition of innovation. An internet search on the <br>definition is likely to yield mi llions of definitions but the common denominator or golden thread is that <br>innovation includes not  only a great idea or inv ention but also the implementation or adoption ther eof in the <br>marketplace or by beneficiaries.  <br>9.4 AMBIDEXTROUS ENTREPRENEURSHIP  <br>9.4.1  Dual role of entrepreneurs over time  <br>Before and during the business start -up phase the entrepreneur tends to focus on wha t is needed to get the <br>business established and operational. At some point entrepreneurial firms have to take on an ambidextrous <br>role of supporting both the operational cyc le of mainstream exploitation of their offerings as well as the new <br>140 <br> stream explorati on and innovation cycle for producing new offerings. They need to do this to remain <br>competitive for the long term, as illustrated in  Figure 9.4 . Firms thrive by repeating what they do well but they <br>can only survive i n the long term by adapting to the cha nging environment (Nolan & Williams, 2010). The <br>ambidextrous entrepreneur would thus  be someone capable of maintaining a context -specific balance between <br>these two cycles in which paradox plays an important role. This is because the environment may not all ow a <br>sequential approach, so events may have to happen simultaneously, as indicated in Figure 9.4 . <br>Figure 9.4 Two -process cycles in harmony  <br> <br>Sources:  Adapt ed from Nolan & Williams (2010); Bot (2012)  <br>9.4.2 The operations cycle of business  <br>The operations cycle mentioned in  section 9.4.1  can be described as a world of known solutions, of rules, <br>procedures, routines, efficien cy, analysis and logical thinking. This cycle is  about exploiting and benefitting <br>from current operations. The entrepreneu rial dreams and aspirations of the founding members are being <br>implemented and the focus shifts to profitability and repeatability for maximum gain in some entrepreneurial <br>start-up co mpanies or ventures. The kind of people who find fulfilment in this world tend to be those who <br>141 <br> prefer predictability, detail, process clarity, control, zero defects and maximum return on investment in <br>whateve r form it was made. Some people are able to oper ate effectively in both cycles and understand what <br>has to be done in both cycles to maximise their mutual contributions. The difference between what can be <br>imagined and what can be done has never been smaller  than it is today.  <br>9.4.3 The innovation cycle of  business  <br>The innovation cycle can be described as a world of dreaming, im agination, experiments, ideas, exploration, <br>speculation, intrigue, uncertainty, possibilities and fun. The kind of people who find ful filment in this world <br>tend to be visionaries, fr ee thinkers, have an open -minded ability to approach opportunities from mu ltiple <br>perspectives, take risks and do not necessarily feel themselves pressurised to deliver specific outputs in a <br>specific time fram e. <br>9.4.4 Creativity as a process  <br>Early attempts to describe creativity as a process date back to 1926 when Wallas describe d four sequential <br>phases (Wallas, 1926). Preparation was first, which is about understanding the problem. Next was incubation <br>– the ur ge to find a better way. Third was illumination or the aha! or Eureka moment of insight. Finally there <br>is the verification  or testing phase. The field has since been extensively researched in different disciplines to <br>produce a body of knowledge that may ex tend beyond the pragmatic requirements of the en trepreneur. More <br>recent contributions to the study of creativity have plac ed emphasis on both the thinking and process aspects <br>of creativity. More emphasis is also placed on creativity  as a social construct, creation of spaces and work <br>environments that fo ster creativity and innovation, and stimulation of creative thinking throu gh interaction, <br>visual stimulation and tools (Von Stamm, 2008). For the entrepreneur it is important to understand that being <br>creative  involves the use of the imagination to create s omething. While the imagination or original thinking <br>required to create so mething may have come from the entrepreneur, the challenge is to also tap into the <br>imagination of others; the entrepreneur can be inst rumental in creating the right environment for c reativity.  <br>9.4.5 The human brain as an operating system  <br>The heading of thi s section is made up of words that are likely to cause different responses from different <br>readers because of their individual thinking  frames. Thinking frames is an approach to enhan ce people’s <br>thinking by deliberately adding to their repertoire of thinkin g (Perkins, 1986). In simplistic terms, we all have <br>our own thinking frames based on personal preferences, experiences and many other factors. These thinking <br>frames become our refere nce points for all incoming information, almost like the operating system of a <br>computer. When incoming information matches the frames with which we are familiar, our frames are <br>reinforced and whether they are  right or wrong, they guide our response to situ ations. When incoming <br>information does not match our thinking frames, the incoming information may be rejected, unless the <br>recipient accommodates the new information by adopting alternative frames. The abilit y to adopt alternative <br>frames, or to reboot or u pdate the brain’s operating system, has been referred to as “kaleidoscope thinking” <br>(Kanter, 2002) and escaping the “intelligence trap” (Cloete, 2013). Metacognition means thinking about <br>thinking and explains  why, for example, accountants think like accoun tants and engineers like engineers <br>(Anderson, 2014). Innovation starts wit h how we think, and creative thinking can be enhanced by giving <br>people more information than they had before, exposing them to ways of  thinking other than their own and <br>increasing th eir motivation to be creative (Amabile, 1996). This involves personal choi ces and understanding <br>the different frames of thinking may be required in different innovation situations. Problems, challenges, <br>probl ems that could be opportunities, challenges and opportunities require different thinking frames. The <br>entrepreneur in  Figure 9.5  has a thinking frame based on the assumption that others will be happy to do  the <br>work to get the idea to business stage.  <br> <br> 142 <br> Figure 9.5 Your role in the business?  <br> <br>The human brain may be the entrepreneur’s  friend or foe becaus e entrepreneurial innovation will be <br>constrained or opened up by the boundaries that the brain has be en requested to maintain. Self -efficacy (SE) <br>is a term used for the belief in one’s capabilities to organise and execute the courses o f action required to <br>manage prospective situations (Bandura, 1994). Low SE -people avoid challenging tasks, believe that di fficult <br>tasks and situations are beyond their capabilities, focus on personal failings and negative outcomes and quickly <br>lose confiden ce in personal abilit ies. According to Bandura (1994), high -SE people view challenging problems <br>as tasks to be mastered, d evelop deeper interest in the activities in which they participate, form a stronger <br>sense of commitment to their interests and activit ies and recover quick ly from setbacks and disappointments. <br>Entrepreneurs and their people can change their SE levels to ch ange their innovation and entrepreneurial <br>performance. In simple terms they may have to reboot or upgrade their thinking systems by ad opting high SE <br>thinki ng frames.  <br>Innovation in India benefits from their deliberate engagement of Jugaad innovators who are  known to be high <br>SE people. Jugaad is a Hindi word that describes frugal innovation or the art of overcoming harsh constraints <br>and im provising  effective s olutions using limited resources (Brem & Wolfram, 2014).  <br>In the right environment, creativity draws o n the whole brain in a dynamic interplay of many different brain <br>regions, emotions, as well as unconscious and conscious processing sy stems (Gregoire & Kau fman, 2016).  <br>143 <br> 9.4.6 Innovation is a team sport  <br>Innovators/entrepreneurs tend to be relentlessly resour ceful themselves or attract such people into their <br>innovation teams. Diversity is vital for gaining new perspectives and team composit ion can deliberately <br>accommodate heterogeneity or diversity to achi eve the desired levels of innovation performance. Some firms <br>employ specialists as well as polymaths. A polymath is a person with a wide knowledge of many subjects <br>(Oxford paperback diction ary and thesaurus, 2009).  <br>Innovation team composition can be used b y the entrepreneur to maintain the status quo, sameness , traditions, <br>irrelevant thinking frames or any other factors resisting the creativity and innovation needed for the firm to <br>gain and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. The entreprene ur can, however, use team <br>composition to bring about ne w thinking. The entrepreneur can also use a range of tools in the process of <br>getting to understand people better and ensure that the t eam operates from the individual and combined <br>strengths of the team  while also crafting the team to overcome weaknesses. I SPI (Innovation Strengths and <br>Preferences Indicator), KAI (Kirton Adaption -Innovation Inventory) and Neethling’s Brain Profiling <br>instruments are examples of what is available to the entrepreneur.  <br>9.5 C REATIVITY AND INNOVATION TOOLS  <br>9.5.1 Imagination is mor e important than knowledge  <br>A more comprehensive version of Albert Einstein’s statement is that imagination is more important than <br>know ledge because knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces th e entire world, stimulating <br>progress, giving birth to e volution (Einstein, 1933) Nonaka (1997) identified two knowledge types that have <br>different management requirements, namely explicit kn owledge (published and available) and tacit knowledge <br>(in people’s heads). Innovations may come from explicit knowledge wh en people reconfigure their knowledge <br>and tacit knowledge is hard to get because it cannot be accessed without the permission of the p erson who has <br>that knowledge. Experience has shown tacit knowledge as a major sources of ideas when people become <br>willing to share. In the innovation economy the emphasis has shifted from having knowledge to what one does <br>with knowledge and in the case of the entrepreneur, it is thus important to place the emphasis on bot h <br>knowledge and its application through innovation ( Business Week , 2004).  <br>9.5.2 Tools for creative thinking  <br>Hundreds of structured creative -thinking tools and techniques are available for u se by the entrepreneur. These <br>may be used when the entrepreneur experiences a need for more creative thinking by individua ls or groups <br>anywhere in the innovation process. Some  tools are available on a licensing or train -the-trainer basis, or <br>through traine d and accredited facilitators. The use of these necessitates some understanding, however, of the <br>context in which creative  thinking is required, the people involved, the compl exity of the problem that has to <br>be solved and tool -related factors that should b e used to inform the choice of tools.  <br>Some tools are highly structured while others are less structured, thus allowing mor e flexibility for the <br>entrepreneur. Some started as h ighly structured but were abused and generalised over time, for example <br>brainstor ming. Entrepreneurs may benefit from developing an understanding of creative -thinking tools and <br>their advantages as well a s limitations. Mind mapping, creative problem solving , design thinking from <br>Stanford university, Edward de Bono’s Lateral Thinking and  Six Thinking Hats, SCAMPER and Synectics <br>are examples of tools that are readily available on the internet and YouTube for  the entrepreneur to access. <br>Biomimicry is a school o f thought that advocates the use of examples from nature in solving problems. The re <br>are many other ways too to stimulate original thinking, including emotional, visual, intellectual and social <br>stimulatio n. 144 <br> 9.5.3 Facilitation for creativity and innovation  <br>Entrepreneurs who prefer to be part of the discussion rather than steering group c onversations and participating <br>may benefit from using a facilitator. Facilitators are used to generate the best possible r esult from a group and <br>are responsible for the proces s, capturing of ideas, and allowing participants to focus solely on the content. <br>Facilitators start by agreeing on the framework to be used and the engagement rules. Ideally facilitators are <br>neutral to t he issues being discussed and should focus on the pro cess while not giving in to temptations to <br>become involved in content or pick sid es. The client or decision maker has to agree on the extent to which <br>participants would be allowed to challenge or shape t he innovation. This is typically done in the form of terms <br>of reference to the facilitator who is often asked to record workshop notes  for further processing after the <br>session or to remain involved as the process owner (Weiss & Legrand, 2011).  <br>9.6 SOUTH AF RICAN NATIONAL INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM  <br>Section 9.3.1  identified innovation -related polic y-level drivers in South Africa and emerging economie s. To <br>make these policies effective, a range of players is needed to make up what  is often referred to as systems of <br>innovation. Such systems may be found at national, regional, provincial, local, sector  or special -interest levels <br>and include ministries su ch as the DST and Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), universities, research <br>councils, specialist advisory bodies like the National Advisory Council on Innovation (NACI) and the National <br>Research Fou ndation (NRF), vocational training institutions, the private sector and the various processes <br>through which these institutions interac t and relate (Marcelle et al., 2015).  <br>Entrepreneurs are encouraged to interact with these institutions to understand how t hey may be able to engage <br>in the various portfolios o f programmes that may provide entrepreneurial opportunities, resources, incentive  <br>schemes, tax rebates and support. Terms and conditions are important for the entrepreneur to understand <br>because they may contain requirements that have implications for the e ntrepreneurs.  <br>9.6.1 The business sector  <br>The GEM Report of 2014 (GEM Report, 2014)  claims that few government initiatives contribute to improving <br>entrepreneurship and that most successful entrepreneur -support initiatives are supported by private companies <br>such as Anglo -American’s ZIMELE programme and South African Breweries KickStart in itiative.  <br>The range of entrepreneurial opportunities and support mechanisms is extensive and the entrepreneur is <br>encourage d to select those appropriate for the firm by explori ng the internet or working through people in the <br>field. At the time of compiling this chapter a Google search on “entrepreneur support South Africa” revealed <br>589 000 hits, listing regional programmes, se ctor-specific programmes, celebrity -endorsed programm es, <br>professional institutions, incubation centres and more than any one entrepren eur could digest in a reasonable <br>time frame. A Google search on “innovation entrepreneur support South Africa” revealed 14  200 000 hits, <br>which is an even greater number that i ncludes science -, engineering - and technology -related support and <br>innovation cent res. A Google search on “innovation support South Africa” revealed 87 million hits listing <br>consultants, multinational ente rprises, intellectual property consultants and many o thers inviting people to <br>share their ideas in exchange for support in multiple fo rms and with certain strings attached.  <br>9.6.2 Pitching for stakeholder engagement or support  <br>Section 9.3.1  alerted the innovator/entrepreneur to the vast range of policies, support entities and mechanisms <br>of possible relevance to the entrepreneur. This section cautions against indiscriminate engagement of entities <br>claiming to be there for t he sole reason of providing support. The innovator/entrepreneur is encouraged to <br>consider such engagements from a systemic  synergistic perspective to ensure alignment in terms  of <br>complementary assets, motives or agendas, expertise, expectations and the sha ring of risks and rewards. 145 <br> Innovation stakeholders refer to institutions and individuals whose support or lack of support may influence <br>the success of small business and may i nclude idea sources, funders, partners and collaborators.  <br>9.6.2.1 Pitching practi ce <br>Entrepreneurs may create or make use of opportunities to present their business case to stakeholders, such as <br>investors  or collaborators. Such opportunities usually allow presenters a few minutes to convey their message <br>to one or more decision makers an d there may be other entrepreneurs pitching for the same opportunity, which <br>puts pressure on presenters to present their c ase well enough to win. Feedback from successful presenters, <br>panel members and observers suggest that the following considerations may  make the difference between <br>success and failure:  <br>9.6.2.2 Before the pitch  <br>• The purpose of a pitch is to tell your story in  an organised way that is understandable to the audience and to <br>meet their criteria for making a positive decision. Knowing your audie nce and what they will be looking <br>for is good.  <br>• Planning for pitching is case -specific because each case and audience diffe rs. Do your homework and <br>practise.  <br>• It is natural for presenters to be nervous – channel this energy towards your audience and message.  <br>• Know what you want and select a process and get you there in the time allowed, which may be only a few <br>minutes.  <br>• Place you rself in the audience’s position and list the questions they might have and have answers for these.  <br>• Understand that presenting a pitch  is like selling a story with a strong vision of what the future would look <br>like if the audience bought into the idea. The  story covers “why this, why us and why now?” (Warner, <br>2016) as will be discussed next.  <br>9.6.2.3 During your pitch  <br>• Explain what the ide a or business does at a simple level.  <br>• Explain the problem or pain it deals with in the market.  <br>• Convey the features and ben efits of your offering and why it is new or different.  <br>• Describe what makes you qualified to alleviate the pain, which may include expe rtise, skills and <br>infrastructure or other assets.  <br>• Indicate that you know the market, such as its size and how it operates,  and what credible share you can <br>attain of it in a reasonable time frame.  <br>• Indicate that competitors in the target market (direct and i ndirect) are well understood.  <br>• Communicate the business model (Osterwalder, 2010), for making money. Include the intended p rice and <br>margin if appropriate (sometimes requested separately).  <br>• Demonstrate that your opportunity is a wise investment that offers a good return in light of the risks being <br>taken.  <br>• Describe how the total investment is made up and will be used.  <br>• Should you b e interrupted, listen to the question and make sure you address their issues.  <br>• Suggest to the audience what you want them to do next, s uch as finding out more, going to a website, <br>watching a video, contacting you etc.  <br>The next section brings the previous se ctions together by emphasising leadership and management issues in <br>innovation.  146 <br> 9.7 LEADING AND MANAGING INNOVATION  <br>9.7.1 People innova te – leadership matters  <br>Despite the technological advancements discussed before, innovation remains mostly a human activit y that <br>relies on human awareness, sense making and creative conduct in a given context. The effect of leadership <br>practices on innovati on performance has been studied and it is becoming increasingly clear from research <br>findings that innovation requires lead ership competencies that are not normally associated with operational <br>management and hierarchical power structures (Hill, Brandeau, Tr uelove & Lineback, 2014).  <br>Innovators/entrepreneurs who wish to establish firms that can sustain innovation over time have to understand <br>their role as leaders. Innovation leaders need to focus on the willingness and the ability of the peo ple to <br>innovate. Wi llingness relates to a sense of community that the leader needs to establish through clarity of <br>purpose, shared values and  the rules of engagement.  To enhance the ability of people to innovate, the leader <br>needs to focus on the establishm ent of creative abr asion, creative agility and creative resolution skills (Hill et <br>al., 2014).  <br>Leadership competence can be linked to the inn ovation performance of firms. Kodak invented digital <br>photography and filed for bankruptcy when they failed to make the new technology work for them. Apple <br>became world leaders in computing technology, and again leadership competencies played a role. Small <br>innovators/entrepreneurs need to understand that both examples are of multinational firms that once were <br>establishe d by small innovato r/entrepreneur -type people who became leaders who had to make choices that <br>affected the innovation performance that follow ed. <br>Leaders create the culture in organisations and an innovation culture may not be compatible with a control -<br>driven culture. In some  organisations it may be easier to replace the people than change the culture and to <br>come up with a new innovation strateg y than make the previous strategy work (Rosenfeld, Wilhelmi & <br>Harrison, 2011).  <br>Entrepreneurs as leaders can benefit  from understanding  the human principles underpinning sustainable <br>innovation (Rosenfeld et al., 2011). These include that  <br>• purpose, direction,  intent is needed behaviour  <br>• culture is the DNA of innovation  <br>• trust is foundational  <br>• colocation allows people communi cation space  <br>• acknow ledging pain and passion phases in innovation is necessary  <br>• understanding that problems influence the quality of ideas gene rated  <br>• comprehension and acceptance of the system used for processing ideas is needed  <br>• understanding what people valu e as motivators  <br>• diversity is needed for new thinking  <br>• acceptance that innovation causes disruption.  <br>9.7.2 Absorptive capacity and innovation f unnels  <br>Absorptive capacity is the ability of a firm to recognise the value of new, external information, assimilate  it <br>and apply it to  commercial ends (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990). Absorptive capacity includes awareness and <br>selective accommodation of multiple  idea sources for innovation as well as open innovation as mentioned <br>before. Absorptive capacity is a term for how organisations use e xternal knowledge in their innovation process <br>and relates to how organisations locate new knowledge to use in their creati on of new innovative new product, <br>service or process (Smith, 2010).  <br>The processing of ideas requires a funnel -type approach for select ing ideas as indicated in  Figure 9.6  and may <br>coincide with the  project -planning a nd product -development approach adopted by the entrepreneur. This may 147 <br> be a conventional product development approach as sh own in  Figure 9.7  or Stage -Gate and other processes <br>(Smith, 2010).  <br>Figure 9.6 Innovation funnel  <br> <br>Figure 9.7  illustrates a conventional product -development  approach that the entrepreneur could use to design <br>a customised approach. It needs to be mentioned that modern -day models are signifi cantly more sophisticated <br>and may be embedded in enterprise architecture software or available from consulting  firms speci alising in <br>the field.  <br>Figure 9.7 A conventional product -development approach  <br> <br>148 <br> 9.7.3 Business models for value creation and value real isation  <br>A business model is a tool for entrepreneurs to benefit from their inventions. It allows the entrepreneur to <br>devel op exploitation mechanisms  to unlock opportunities and consider options where different configurations <br>offer different yields for the entrepre neur’s appetite even before a more comprehensive business plan is <br>formulated (Smith, 2010). Osterwalder’s business  model canvas is a useful approach towards crafting a <br>business model that answers nine questions on one page as indicated in  Table 9.1 . <br>Table 9.1 Business model canvas  <br>Infrastructure  Offering  Market  <br>Key partner s <br>Who works with <br>us to run this <br>business model?  Key activities  <br>Who does what to <br>run this business <br>model?  Value proposition s <br>What value does our client <br>receive from us (problems <br>solved or needs satisfied)?  Customer <br>relationships  <br>What relationshi ps do <br>we pur sue with our <br>customers?  Customer <br>segments  <br>What describes our <br>target customers <br>groups or <br>segments?  <br>Key resources  <br>What ski lls, <br>equipment and <br>other resources are <br>used?  Channels  <br>Which channels are <br>used for delivering <br>value to customers?  <br>Finan ce <br>Cost stru cture  <br>What expenses are required to run this business <br>model?  Revenue streams  <br>What income sources are associated with this business <br>model?  <br>Source:  Adapted from Osterwalder & Pigneur (2010)  <br>9.7.4 Innovation management frameworks and audits  <br>Several studies s how that management accepts the significance of innovation and that management has to play <br>a leading role in making it hap pen. Most managers, however, are not sure what they should do diffe rently to <br>achieve better innovation performance.  <br>Management of inno vation comprises well -established functions relating to planning, organising, initiating <br>and monitoring innovation, and in cludes the sections that follow. Strategy and resourcing are critic al in the <br>management function because of the risks and uncertaintie s involved that may be devastating for entrepreneurs <br>if not addressed by management. Innovation sometimes happens by chanc e and the intention of this chapter <br>is not to make serendipity unpo pular. There are many well -documented examples of ideas that change d the <br>world. Most innovation however, is of an incremental nature and can be accomplished through  planning, <br>organising, le ading and control. These four functions of management can and shoul d be conducted in a manner <br>that directs and unleashes the creative potential of people towards areas of strategic significance to the <br>organisation.  <br>Innovation management frameworks range fr om very basic to very sophisticated and successful innovators <br>tend to be those who have customised frameworks and idea management infr astructures for their particular <br>situations.  149 <br> For the small emerging firm a more generic management framework may help the entrepreneur to focus <br>innovation energy and resources on those area s that are particularly relevant for the future success and <br>sustain ability of the firm. As one of the generic frameworks freely available, the McKinsey 7S (Bryan, 2008) <br>is a heuristic model  that enables entrepreneurs to manage innovation, enhance alignment  between participants <br>and develop a comprehensive, coherent and int egrated innovation effort for further refinement based on <br>learning from their successes and failures across the perspectiv es shown in  Figure 9.8 . <br>Figure 9.8 McKinsey 7S model  <br> <br>Source:  Adapted from Bry an (2008)  <br>• Strategy  conveys a plan developed by a firm to achieve sustained competitive advantage and successfully <br>compete in the marke t through innovation.  <br>• Structure  represents the way in which people, their responsibilities and units are organised in supp ort of the <br>strategy.  <br>• Systems  are the processes and procedures of how things are done and the decisions made for innovation.  <br>• Style  is the way the firm is managed and t he management style used to achieve innovation.  <br>• Staff  describes the type and number of emp loyees the firm will need and how they will be recruited, trained, <br>motivated and rewarded.  <br>• Skills  are the abilities, capabilities and competencies of the firm or inno vation team.  <br>• Shared  values  form the core of the McKinsey 7S model and include the norms an d standards that guide <br>employee behaviour and company actions. This is particularly important for creativity and innovation that <br>may b e in conflict with established r outines.  <br> <br>150 <br> Studies confirm that all elements must be given equal importance and integrated t o achieve the best results. <br>Continuous review of all elements is important as well as understanding that changes in one area may affec t <br>all the other areas.  <br>An innova tion audit is the application of a framework to determine the state of innovation in the f irm for the <br>context in which it operates and typically assists the entrepreneur to identify: areas that are not aligned; areas <br>in need  of intervention; as well as goo d practices that may differentiate the firm from competing entities. The <br>format of selecte d audit tools may differ but the essence is that the entrepreneur has to be able to use it to make <br>a wide -ranging review of the factor s affecting innovation success a nd failure and how management of <br>innovation might be improved (Tidd & Bessant, 2013). Bene fits of an innovation audit may include (Mobbs, <br>2011) the following:  <br>• Enhancement of innovation capabilities at individual and collecti ve levels  <br>• Establishment of innov ation -performance baselines across the firm to determine what you did right and <br>wrong, or as a way of understanding why things happened the way they did  <br>• Monitoring of innovation progress over time  <br>• Being able to relate specif ic interventions to innovation o utcomes  <br>• Learning from successes and failures to focus on improvement in innovation managem ent <br>• Benchmarking baselines to compare units and projects both internally and externally  <br>• Being able to compile checklists to see if you  are doing things right as well as focus on other areas  <br>• Establishment of a learning resource to help acquire knowledge and  reasons to try new things  <br>• Identification of innovation hurdles and control of barriers that may stifle creativity and innovation  <br>• Alignment across the organisation in  terms of common purpose and action  <br>Creativity and innovation, by their very nature, tend to break routine and established practices, which is why <br>the entrepreneur has to be very cautious not to stifle but rather guide and n urture creativity and innovation  for <br>strategic advantage.  <br>Snakes and ladders games remain popular and even appear as apps and on other digital media. This may be a <br>good analogy and metaphor for innovation management. Despite having plans and capable people  there may <br>be successes and fail ures along the road. Success and failure traps may be the innovation equivalents of snakes  <br>and ladders. A good idea well executed may take the entrepreneur up the ladder and leave everyone involved <br>with a sense of achievemen t and fulfilment. Unfortunately this may soon become the performance model and <br>people get stuck in practices that no longe r yield successful results because the landscape has changed. <br>Similarly the snakes or failures may destroy morale and dreams if not we ll managed to serve as learning <br>platforms for new insights and improve innovation performance.  <br>9.8 CONCLUSION  <br>From discuss ions and sources cited in this chapter, it should be clear that there are indeed factors that support <br>entrepreneurs in, or constrain t hem from, starting and maintaini ng businesses. It should also be clear that <br>creativity and innovation in entrepreneurship continue to be critical factors for differentiating a sustainable <br>business that brings multiple rewards to the entrepreneur and societ y. There are programmes being pu t into <br>place by policy makers and institutions that aim to improve the entrepreneurial per formance of South Africa <br>and other developing economies. It should also be clear from this chapter that creativity and innovation rema in <br>key for a better future and t hat innovation starts with how the entrepreneur thinks and that this way of thinking <br>is a personal choice. This chapter cannot decide on behalf of entrepreneurs but may enhance their ability to <br>succeed in harnessing creativi ty and innovation for business s uccess.  151 <br> REVIEW QUESTIONS  <br>9.1 Explain why creativity and innovation should be promoted for entrepreneurial success in emerging economies like South <br>Africa.  <br>9.2 Explain the concept of “innovation context” and its influence on the competitiveness of entrepreneurial enterprises in <br>emergin g economies.  <br>9.3 Identify myths and misconceptions about crea tivity and innovation, and their negative implications for entrepreneurs.  <br>9.4 If a business is seen as a competitive value -linked syst em, describe typical areas where the entrepreneur can use <br>innovation to create and sustain value.  <br>9.5 Describe the relatio nship between ambidextrous entrepreneurship and the two cycles of efficiency (operations) and <br>disruption (innovation).  <br>9.6 Indicate th e need for particular thinking styles in an entrepreneurial v enture.  <br>9.7 Explain why creativity and innovation tools are r equired and recommend when to use these tools.  <br>9.8 Describe an innovation ecosystem and identify the players by indicating their contr ibutions to the system, capabilities, <br>resources and infrastru cture elements.  <br>9.9 Identify the human principles that underp in sustainable innovation.  <br>9.10 Describe the elements required for effective innovation management.  <br>REFERENCES  <br>Amabile, T.M. 1996.

Conducting busin ess is no lo nger an issue that concerns the owner/s alone. Business conduct <br>has become the concern of everyone, including the workforce, authorities and communities. In South Africa, <br>for example, everybody, including business, is governed by the country’s constitution . So, in considering the <br>issues of ethics, governance and sustainability including environmental sustainabilit y, the constitution is <br>fundamental. This raises a lot of issues to be considered in business management. How do we ensure we <br>conduct b usiness to t he most acceptable standards and therefore ensure that the business will still be there <br>tomorrow? Particularly  in emerging economies, and with regard to the small and medium enterprises (SMEs), <br>this question becomes fundamental.  <br>While we pursue  the issues in this chapter, it is also essential that we keep in mind that our subject is about <br>small and medium enterpri ses in emerging economies. To this effect, the reader has to follow the arguments <br>with the mind of an SME where, in many cases, the ow ners may not  necessarily be able to comply with many <br>forms of legislation for a number of reasons, such as limited funding  and limited business training. <br>Furthermore, in other instances there is simply no training at all. These enterprises serve as the onl y sources <br>of livelihood for the owners who might not wish to work for someone else. Many such enterprises will be <br>found in  the informal economic sector while a few will operate in the formal economic sector. However, in <br>spite of wherever the business is, t he issues of  ethical conduct, good governance and business sustainability <br>can never be overemphasised. Otherwise, even at the most basic level, the family could be left in difficult <br>situations.  <br>In this chapter, we look at the interrelationship between ethi cs, good cor porate governance and sustainability. <br>We link these concepts to the concept of Ubuntu, an old African philosop hy that governs relations between <br>people and their environments. It demands that human beings interact with each other and their envir onments 155 <br> in respectful ways. In so doing, we manage ourselves, business and the environment better and ensure <br>sustainabilit y of our activities and the very natural environment on which those activities depend.  <br>10.2 ETHICS IN BUSINESS  <br>The idea of a socially -responsible company or one that is motivated to behave morally or ethically arose <br>following public outrage over various bu siness scandals. Scandals led to increased regulatory scrutiny which <br>led to companies developing their own business ethics policies (F ountain, 201 2). <br>The pursuit of profits and economic progress is not a license to ignore community norms, values, and stand ards <br>of respect, integrity, and quality (US Department of Commerce, 2004).  <br>Today it is almost impossible to talk about business govern ance and eth ics (set of moral principles determining <br>the wrong and the right) without referring to the King reports. These  are the reports by Judge Mervyn King <br>on corporate governance for South Africa. The reports have become the fundamental documents by w hich to <br>cond uct ethical business in South Africa, taking into consideration the ecological, political and social <br>condition s in the country. The King III Report is ground -breaking because it deviates from the business <br>tradition in that business is only to m ake profit. The King III compels business to factor in other issues to <br>ensure sustainability. On the other hand, the King IV places emphasis on stakeholder considerations and it is <br>more outcomes based. Among other things, it calls for fairness, transparenc y and accoun tability as principles <br>of good corporate citizenship. This reminds businesses that they do not operate in a va cuum, but that they are <br>part of the greater society.  <br>The question is what constitutes an ethical issue? It is not possible to provide a definitive  answer to this <br>question because ethics relates to normative conduct. People in different contexts have differ ent views on what <br>is “ethical”. Take for example the concept of Ubuntu. How we treat other human beings (in business, politics, <br>social  and cultura lly in life) and how we relate with our natural environment are issues very pertinent to <br>Ubuntu. In the proces s of running a business and earning profits, it is always crucial to understand that we <br>should treat everyone and everything with resp ect. The bus iness depends on people and the natural <br>environment for its own sustainability. In a business sense, the follo wing could constitute ethical factors:  <br>10.2.1 Environmental pollution  <br>The manner in which businesses treat the natural environment has  consequence s for development and <br>humanity. Business is guilty of environmental degradation on a number of fronts includin g dumping, <br>producing chemicals that affect the environment negatively as well as noise. All these pollute (make dirty) the <br>environment . In the con text of Ubuntu, we should respect and treat the environment with a view to preserving <br>it for the next generati ons. Ubuntu dictates that the land also belonged to those that went before us and will <br>belong to those that are still to come after us . We should therefore use the natural environment with <br>sustainability in mind.  <br>10.2.2 Conflict of interest  <br>This relates to  situations that have the potential to lead to ethical breach, whereby individual interests appear <br>to conflict with those of the entit y that a per son represents. An example would be when individuals use their <br>official position for personal benefit. Everywh ere human beings interact, there are issues that affect them in <br>different ways. In business, it is important to avoid these as they co uld affect t he business and make it difficult <br>to manage. Conflicts of interests, therefore, have an impact on the governan ce and sustainability of the <br>business. This is due to ethical concerns. Ubuntu demands that in situations of conflict of interest, the  <br>individuals  concerned declare their interests. Today business requires of all its employees to sign declarations <br>of inter est. If an individual or individuals are found to have compromised an organisation, they can never 156 <br> declare ignorance and must explain their action s. It is therefore an element of Ubuntu to do the right thing <br>without having to be pushed from behind.  <br>10.2.3 Quality control  <br>The service (and product) the business offers must comply with the standards for which it is designed. It is <br>unethical  to sell peo ple a substandard product. Such behaviour is not only punishable by law but it has negative <br>effect on the sust ainability of the enterprise. This is because neither a business’s customers nor its stakeholders <br>would wish to be associated with suc h business. An enterprise that produces something that does not meet <br>with set quality standards also has an effect on the environment from which it extracts its resources. It is only <br>right to ensure good quality service/product to clients and everyone else . To this en d, enterprises should spend <br>a lot of money should ensure good quality, and compromising one’s standards could cost the business dearly.  <br>10.2.4 Discrimination in hiring and promotion  <br>It is important for the enterprise to be seen to be applying e thical beha viour in terms of the manner it chooses <br>its staff, including with regard to promotions. There needs to be trans parency; for example, having clear <br>procedures when advertising jobs, placing these adverts in all publicly accessible media, short -listing <br>candid ates and having fair interviewing processes and procedures. In short, it is important to afford everyone <br>equal opportunities to be employed or promoted. Discrimination on the basis of colour, gender, religion or <br>otherwise is simply unfair and it  is bad bus iness. All these must be conducted in accordance with the just laws <br>of the land.  <br>10.2.5 Misuse of company infor mation and assets  <br>It happens that employees use information and company assets (e.g. secrets, cars, computers) they obtain from <br>the co mpany eithe r to blackmail it in one way or another, or to use the information and assets to benefit <br>themselves. Many compa nies have made it compulsory for their employees to sign contracts (or include a <br>clause in the employment contract) on these particula r issues. I t is unethical for an individual to steal company <br>assets and information for their own private interests.  <br>We ha ve said that ethics relates to normative behaviour. This makes it difficult to define, thus many employees <br>“get away with murder”. To educate their staff members, the enterprise should ensure training sessions for <br>everyone to instil the required value s and  principles. Continuing to deliver a defective service or product is <br>simply unethical and it will cost the company dearly at some stag e. In this regard, the following are seen as <br>principles of Ubuntu and are therefore ethical:  <br>• Honesty:  it is important  that everyone in the company remains honest in their dealings with stakeholders. If <br>mistakes are detected with the service or product at s ome stage, those that the company does business <br>with deserve to be informed accordingly. Similarly, if the stakeholde rs po int out some defect in the <br>service or product, the company must ensure the defects are addressed without delay.  <br>• Openness/transparency:  rumours can be dangerous to a reputation. The best way to avoid rumours is to be <br>transparent with regard to business  activities. It is reassuring to everyone in the company when things are <br>done in an open way, and management allows people space to express  themselves though this requires <br>skill to manage because that same space can be easily abused by both parties.  <br>• Respon siven ess: what happens when employees and/or probably other stakeholders complain and nobody <br>listens? In the end, they all realise their bu siness is not valued – employees leave and stakeholders stop <br>doing business with the company. Then the business might  fail to honour its commitments with others. <br>This could risk the company’s future.  <br>• Accountability:  in situations where people are accountab le to no one, especially management, everyone is <br>likely to behave in their own way. It is therefore critical that the  lines of reporting are clearly explained <br>and understood by everyone in the company.  <br>• Due diligence:  This principle means that due care is t aken in order to complete a task, so  that those involved <br>remain safe. This principle simply means that the right pers on do es the right job at the right time and <br>right place.  157 <br> • Fairness:  if all these principles can be honoured, then there is fairness and ever yone will be satisfied and <br>happy. If we cannot keep our business stakeholders satisfied and happy, then we should not  be in <br>business.  <br>In this regard, companies are obliged to conduct business in ethical ways – by being prescriptive on what <br>constitutes a mo ral act under specific circumstances. Companies can achieve this by (Rossouw, 2002: 414)  <br>• determining stakeholder perc eptio ns and expectations of the business  <br>• codifying ethical standards  <br>• monitoring ethical performance  <br>• communicating and training on ethics  <br>• rewarding ethical behaviour  <br>• reporting behaviour affecting ethics – positively or negatively  <br>• auditing ethical performanc e. <br>Taken in totality, business ethics extends beyond employer -employee relations to include extended relations <br>with the customers, sharehol ders and the community. This is also the emphasis of the King IV Report. <br>Business ethics will then mean those practic es an d behaviours that reflect societal acceptance. We say societal <br>acceptance because the issues that society considers as moral are ever changing. Consider, for example, the <br>fact that at some stage certain sexual orientations were scorned by society and simil arly by business. Today <br>society accepts these matters as a given and discrimination has reduced in comparison to how it was a few <br>years ago. At a social level then, business ethics means behaviour that is regarded as normal by the larger <br>society. It i s a s ituation of always showing Ubuntu in all our dealings. These norms emanate from many <br>sectors:  <br>• Family:  before people are business owner s or employees, they are family members. Their education begins <br>from their childhoods and backgrounds. They are taugh t cer tain moral values to live by. These values get <br>transferred to workplaces as individuals from various backgrounds come together. Busine ss leaders must <br>know how to deal with such diversity and use it as a strength rather than something to be avoided.  <br>• Friends : besides families, people grow with friends or find them along the way. Through such interactions, <br>new ideas are learnt. These are al so brought into the workplace.  <br>• Professions:  a company employs people from different professions who have been taught diffe rently in <br>accordance with the principles and values of their professions. At company level, they all have to pursue <br>one goal that has been determined by one company with its own norms, values and standards.  <br>• Geographic location:  in a company, people co me fr om different parts of the country or even the world. They <br>bring with them moral values as determined by their own communities. Again, they have to adjust and <br>adapt to a new environment that may have values different from theirs. But if the company is to su rvive, <br>its ethical values must triumph.  <br>The important question, then, becomes how we make ethical behaviour possible. One cannot deter mine the <br>extent to which any particular action will succeed, but the following actions are critical:  <br>• Senior managemen t: it should be the duty of senior managers to ensure that the company complies with set <br>ethical standards. Management itself should be see n to be living those ethical standards because any <br>disjuncture has the potential to raise suspicions among other stak ehold ers, especially the workforce.  <br>• Ethics training:  there is nothing that binds people to specific ways of conduct. However, if everybody <br>involved is made to account for their actions, then ethical behaviour has a chance to succeed. It also helps <br>to arrange et hical training for all involved.  <br>• Self-analysis:  a firm/company should be able to institute mechanisms through which everybody can asse ss <br>themselves. If there are agreed standards of conduct, it should not be difficult for individuals to see when <br>their own actions become contradictory to the set norms an d values.  <br>We may also add that to ensure ethical conduct, incentives may go a long way  to make corporate ethical <br>conduct possible. Such incentives could be built into a performance appraisal. Individuals who prove to be <br>ethical in the majority of cases are  incentivised through a number of mechanisms, such as promotions, pay <br>rises, certifica tes of merit, or even a simple letter of thanks.  <br>Equally important is to understand why people tend to act unethically eve n though the consequences could be <br>severe. Uneth ical behaviour could be informed by factors such as  158 <br> • pressure to meet goals  <br>• ignorance o f the company code of conduct  <br>• job dissatisfaction  <br>• low financial rewards.  <br>Companies can assist employees avoid unethical be haviour in the following ways:  <br>• Cultivating a cul ture of integrity  <br>• Ensuring a fair and equitable incentive system  <br>• Making opportunities available to all without discrimination  <br>• Allowing individuals to make their own choices where necessary  <br>• Allowing individual s the opportunity for continual improvement and life-long learning  <br>• Giving individuals the freedom to raise concerns without fear of re tribution  <br>• Emphasising exemplary leadership in the company  <br>10.3 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  <br>The South African Companies Act 71 of 2008 governs the functioning of business in Sout h Africa. It <br>prescribes matters of registration, compliance and intellectual property.  This Act also requires businesses to <br>follow specific principles, such as transparency and accountability.  <br>The King III an d IV reports have also come to constitute the fu ndamental documents for business governance <br>especially in South Africa. They provide g ood guide for anyone involved in or wishing to start a business.  <br>The first King Report appeared in 1994 and the second in 2002. The third report came out in 2009 and the <br>fourth in 2017. The reports are on corporate governance. Rossouw (2002: 406) explains the rise of corporate <br>governance as a result of what he calls “ag ency problems, investor activism and the desire to attrac t foreign <br>investors and gain legitimacy”. He then defines corporate governance as the internal and external measures <br>with which a comp any is regulated. This function is vested with the boards of dire ctors and entails 1) strategic <br>direction; 2) executive ac tion; 3) supervision; and 4) accountability. Corporate governance is guided by the <br>principles of 1) fairness; 2) accountability; 3) re sponsibility; and 4) transparency. Corporate governance <br>relates t o the manner in which a business is run. It includes the principles, policies, procedures and <br>responsibilities of management in ensuring that the business is conducted in effective, efficient  and <br>accountable ways. Such governance contributes to the sustain ability of the business. Corporate governance is <br>therefor e aimed at ensuring that conflicts of interests are minimised and that the assets of the business are used <br>properly and productively.  <br>Business governance also means that the rights and responsibiliti es of directors, managers and shareholders <br>are clearly de fined in a transparent, fair and equitable manner. These factors affect business differently <br>depending on the nature of the business, be they sole proprietorships, partnerships or corporates. While <br>business/corporate governance entails the effective runnin g and profitability of the business, environmental <br>(e.g. pollution prevention) and social (e.g. human rights) issues constitute import ant factors without which the <br>business risks failure. In summary,  corporate governance should guard against: incomplete an d misleading <br>financial statements (accounting measures); misuse of business assets by managers and directors (asset risk); <br>and over -committing the business in such a way that long -term interests are negatively affected (strategic <br>risk).  <br>The third King Repo rt requires that companies take into account their social responsibilities where they <br>operate in terms of  <br>• black economic empowerment ( BEE)  <br>• health and HIV/AIDS  <br>• human development.  159 <br> Poor business govern ance could expose the company to litigation. This causes b ad publicity, financial costs <br>and moral demotivation among staff. In South Africa companies spend a lot of  time and money defending th e <br>actions of their managers at courts such as the CCMA and payin g lawyers to defend them. Managers then <br>have to spend even  more time testifying in court. In the majority of cases, these actions result from unethical <br>business conduct.  <br>Governance also extend s beyond the corporate to include civil society and the labour m ovement. Labour <br>movements or trade unions are an integral part of doing business in almost every country. Labour is further <br>protected at the global level through the International Labour Organ ization (ILO) which is an agency of the <br>United Nations. This mea ns that labour rights are an international phenomenon and business must respect <br>these.  <br>Corporate governance further depends on the nature and size of the enterprise. While the principles remai n <br>the same, there are variations, for example, between a sole tr ader and a public company with limited liability. <br>Corporat e governance is a principled exercise on the part of management. It is to be observed that successful <br>businesses are guided by certain  principles in their governance. These include:  <br>• Role of board an d management:  the board is elected by shareholders in a pr operly constituted meeting of <br>shareholders. The role of the board is to ensure that the interests (profits) of shareholders are realis ed. To <br>achieve this objective, the board must ensure that the co ncerns of all stakeholders (employees, <br>customers, supplier s, local communities) are taken seriously. The board also: appoints the CEO; <br>determines the CEO’s salary; ensures succession planning;  helps the CEO determine the salaries of senior <br>management; revi ews and monitors financial and business strategies; and ke eps in place processes to <br>maintain the integrity of the company.  <br>• Qualifications:  the appointed directors must have the highest persona l and professional integrity, ethics and <br>values. They should com mit to the long -term interest of the owners/shareholders. Directors must not <br>have direct or indirect interests in the business, i.e. directors must be independent individuals.  <br>• Size:  the compos ition of the board must be such that it reflects population dive rsity in terms of gender and <br>race, for example. But divers ity in terms of views could also add vigour to the company performance, if <br>handled properly.  <br>• Policies/articles:  corporate governance c overs all the aspects of ensuring that policies are developed, <br>applied and executed in the most appropriate manner. Such p olicies will, for example, be on <br>compensation, leave, meetings and appraisals.  <br>• Ethical culture:  specific values such as trust, integri ty and honesty play an important role in business. These <br>values must be cultivated among all involved in the business, reg ardless of level.  <br>• Transparency:  transparency is related to accountability. The business must be open to constructive <br>engagement with s hareholders and provide full disclosures on all matters, especia lly on financial <br>reporting.  <br>• Equity and fairness:  it is imp ortant that everyone feels they are being treated fairly. The handling of matters <br>of remuneration and promotions, for example, if not properly conducted, could lead to dissatisfaction, <br>mistrust and resentment.  <br>10.4 SUSTAINABILITY  <br>We have said so much about  Ubuntu, ethical behaviour and corporate governance because these are essential <br>for the continued survival of the enterprise and there fore its sustainability. What makes a business live for a <br>hundred years and still remain profita ble? The question we are a sking therefore is: what sustains a business?  <br>The concept of (environmental) sustainability is traceable from the Brundtland Commissio n of 1980 under the <br>leadership of the former Prime Minister of Norway, Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland. In 1987 she published a <br>book called  Our common future  on sustainable d evelopment. The book and the work of the commission have <br>become known for the definition  they gave to sustainable development – “… development that meets the 160 <br> needs of the present without compromising the abilit y of future generations to meet their own need s”. It was <br>the first international commission to address environmental issues to the ext ent it did. This commission found <br>that big business was also responsible for much environmental degradation. The cutting d own of rain forests, <br>in particular, was identi fied as having  a huge impact on global warming. Since then, businesses have been <br>trying to find ways and means to reduce their footprints on the environment and also stay alive. The <br>commission’s findings on cli mate change have since been translated into al l spheres of activity, including <br>business, politics, economy and society.  <br>The World Econ omic Forum (WEF, 2014) argues that incorporating sustainability will ensure the business <br>reduces risks and capitalises on communities, consumers and employees they do b usiness with. Every business <br>should be concerned with the environmental issues in its su pply chain. Furthermore, incorporation of the <br>human rights culture should also be core to business practices if business i s to benefit its shareholders. <br>Ensuring issues  such as fairness, equity and meaningful participation of women in the business should i mprove <br>the workforce’s profitability and growth. A business venture that ignores these factors runs the risk of <br>confrontat ion with the labour force and local communitie s. Business sustainability can therefore be referred <br>to as considerations for all the ec onomic, social, political and environmental factors within which the <br>enterprise operates in pursuit of its vision and miss ion. <br>To be sustainable, all enterprises, big a nd small, should be rooted in specific principles, such as the following:  <br>• Focused leader ship with clear direction:  business requires that those entrusted with responsibility execute <br>their duties in focused ways  and remain able to provide direction especial ly under challenging <br>circumstances.  <br>• Sustained and continuous improvement of strategies:  what worked yesterday will not necessarily work <br>today. This means that the business requires constant evaluation of the ma nner in which it does business. <br>The strengths  and weaknesses  of the business should be assessed constantly. Similarly, <br>new  opportuniti es and threats  appear all the time and the business must be able to address these <br>correctly if it is to survive at all. Th us many businesses still apply the methodology  of SWOT to assess their <br>activities.  <br>• Exploring and grooming capacity in people:  without capable staff, a business will die. It makes sense to <br>employ and constantly train key personnel in particular, but the bot tom line is that everyone should <br>receive train ing on all aspects of their duties. Training must basically be seen as an investment in the <br>business. Small businesses especially stand to benefit from various business workshops and seminars that <br>take place in  the vicinity from time to time.  <br>• Maintaining s ustainable values:  we have said so much already with regard to sustainability and values . <br>Correct and relevant values that speak to the customers are a solid ground on which to base a business. <br>Customer loyalty , for example, is highly dependent on the valu es that a business displays.  <br>• Conducting business in an ethical way to ensure acceptable standards:  ethical conduct is supreme. It shows <br>the business has respect for all. Because of its ethics, it becomes truste d, reliable and a life -long partner <br>for many.  <br>Sustainability cannot be separated from ethics and governance. These factors are all enc ompassing. They <br>ensure quality services and products, and create a conducive business environment. Furthermore they ensure  <br>the enterprise delivers on its mandate and th at it is able to deal with difficult situations without deviating from <br>its core principl es. They can be regarded as instruments to achieve Ubuntu in the world of business.  <br>10.5 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT  <br>The succes s of every business is dependent on the extent  to which it relates to those with whom it has dealings. <br>This is a two -way situation: fi rstly, it is those that  depend on the business  for their own existence and survival, <br>and secondly it is those that  the bus iness depends on  for its own existence and sur vival. This is a fundamental <br>relationship and it must inform the existence strategy of t he business. The strategy is about why, when and 161 <br> how the company responds to the needs and concerns of the other stakehold ers. A company’s actions, for <br>example, affect those who use its products and/or services, and similarly the actions of those who use t hose <br>services and/or products affect the company. Stakeholder engagement is therefore the mutual exercise of a <br>company to keep those with whom it does business satisfie d with its own activities.  <br>To ensure he althy stakeholder engagement, a company has to ha ve clear internal management policies that <br>govern management of external relations. The policy lays down protocol in terms  of communication channels. <br>Such a policy should include the following aspects:  <br>• It mu st be very clear that there is only one person wh o liaises with the media. Every company must be <br>concerned with its own image to outsiders. Bad publicity is bad business. The information that goes out to <br>the stakeholders must always be credible and the com pany must have the mechanisms to counter <br>informat ion that has the potential to damage company image.  <br>• Critical changes within the company must be reported to the stakeholde rs. This will include information on <br>new promotions, additions to senior staff, resig nations and replacements as well as new acquisiti ons. <br>Outsiders need to know who they deal with in a company and they are concerned with the manner in <br>which their partners  do business.  <br>• Levels of communication must be relevant. This will include specifying who responds to an enquiry by a <br>director from the  other company stakeholder. It is disrespectful to assign a junior staff member to meet <br>with a director of another company , for example.  <br>What we have indicated here has huge implications for the sustainabili ty of a business. In a situation where <br>the busine ss shows poor governance and poor ethical conduct in its relations with others, sustainability gets <br>affected. We indicated  at the beginning of this section that a business depends on others and that  there  are <br>others that depend on it in return. A business should not allow its image to be affe cted by having to do business <br>with unethical part ners. If a firm ill -treats its workers and these in turn go on work stoppages frequently, <br>suppliers and customers lose con fidence in it and they look elsewhere.  <br>10.5.1 Cross -border stakeholder management  <br>Although we may wish to treat this as a separate asp ect, it is not. Here we refer to stakeholders in other <br>countries. Many businesses also have customers and suppliers in oth er countries. What happens if there is <br>suddenly political instability in our country?  How do we get our trade partners in other countr ies to trade with <br>us? In situations of political instability, business also becomes a casualty. There are many examples of  <br>countries in emerging economies that are today characterised by economic upheavals. There is unemployment <br>and poverty because busines s has left.  <br>But it is not only political instability that is bad news for business. In instances where authorities have no  sense <br>of ethical conduct, where corporate governance is unpredictable, stakeholders get shaky knees and business <br>sustainability suffe rs. How do you do business, for example, in a situation where every official asks for a bribe <br>for everything you do or ask  for, even if it is a legal and normal business activity? How do you pay tax when <br>you have been taxed illegally at every turn?  <br>These k inds of issues may be very difficult to manage. It is nonetheless the responsibility of the company to <br>have a clear stakeh older management policy to guide it in such situations. There is, therefore, a clear need for <br>the business to have a strategic policy on how to deal with public officials even across the borders of one’s <br>national territory.  <br>Problems are not only with publi c officials. In some countries business is also guilty of unethical behaviour. <br>Above we referred to the activities of the ILO. It happ ens frequently that you discover your suppliers <br>somewhere have no respect for human rights and the working conditions of t heir labour force are abhorrent, <br>such as child labour. It requires ethical consideration also on your part to decide if you con tinue d oing business <br>with such partners or you look elsewhere.  162 <br> 10.6 CONFLICTING INTERESTS  <br>The link between ethics, governance and  sustainability should be seen as the pillars of any business enterprise. <br>Missing any one of them could spell the end of the bu siness.  Ethical conduct is so imperative that other <br>business entities may find it difficult to conduct business with a partner wh o behaves unethically. South Africa <br>has a very good example of such a case with the Indian Gupta family that came to invest in the cou ntry. The <br>events led to major banks and some auditing firms cancelling business deals with all  the companies owned by <br>the Gupta family (City Press, 10 April 2016). None wished to be seen as an accomplice in the matter.  <br>The Gupta case is an important  ethica l matter in the world of business. It did not require any court intervention <br>to judge whether their conduct was indeed une thical or if they had ever influenced government in any specific <br>way. Business took a decision on its own to protect its own in tegrity . This case has practically proven the link <br>between good governance, corporate citizenship, sustainability and ethical beh aviour. This relationship can <br>be better represented as in  Figure 10.1 . <br>Figure 10.1  The relationship between ethics, good governance and sustainability  <br> <br> <br>We are arguing here that sustainability, good governance and e thics constitute the pillars for the business <br>environment. The fall of any one pillar has a direct impact on the business environment, including on specific <br>entities. The Gupta case comes into p lay again. Due to their unethical conduct, they found themselv es in a <br>situation where it affected their business environment negatively, and doing business in South Africa became <br>unsus tainable for them.  <br>10.7 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS  <br>We have just indica ted above that the World Trade Organization (WTO), among its o ther duties, ensures that <br>countries adhere to the intellectual property rights principle. It is important that we understa nd what <br>intellectual property (rights) entails.  <br>163 <br> Intellectual property re fers to principles or policies (even rules) that govern the us e of other people’s ideas and <br>insignia. These rights are contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 2 7 and they date <br>back to the 1883 Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and the 1886 Berne Convention <br>for the Prot ection of Literary and Artistic Works (WIPO, 2004). These can be divided into  <br>• copyright, which protect original forms of e xpression as in books, music, movies and computer software <br>programs  <br>• pate nt rights, which protect new inventions or discoveries  <br>• tradema rks, which protect words and symbols associated with business entities  <br>• trade secrets on commercial information.  <br>Intellectu al property rights are important in various ways including  <br>• enabling indi viduals to benefit from their inventions  <br>• encouraging individua ls to further their innovations and creativity as well as economies to grow, creating <br>new jobs and improving quality of li fe. <br>ACTIVITY  <br>Refer to the WIPO website:  http://www.wipo.int  and write brief notes on the following intellectual property rights:  <br>• Mission of the WIPO  <br>• Definition of intellectual property  <br>• Copyrights  <br>• Trademarks  <br>10.8 CONCLUSION  <br>It is important to understand that the issues we address are in other instances dependent on the size of the <br>organisat ion. In situations such as in emerging economies where many enterprises are small family businesses, <br>management is complet ely different from that of a multinational company. But also, it is in these businesses <br>that cultural expressions  such as Ubuntu are f ound in abundance. It is also here that most aspects of legislation <br>simply do not exist. It is not that they refuse to com ply, but that it is simply impractical to do so due to a <br>number of factors.  <br>Although the issues we address here m ay appear to be appli cable only to big business, we are confident that <br>they are indeed pertinent to small and medium enterprises. Be it a small  informal family business or a medium <br>formal business, ethics, governance and sustainability are issues that can make a difference bet ween success <br>and failure. This is because it is too easy for everyone to notice when things are not done procedurally in a  <br>small business. Poor governance and lack of protocol, among other things, are quick to come to the fore when <br>management displays poor  values and lacks principles.  <br>In emerging economies, the issues of ethical conduct, good governance and sustainability for  the SMEs cannot <br>be overemphasised. It is these entities that provide much needed job opportunities for the many unemployed. <br>SMEs ther efore have a critical role to play in these situations.  164 <br> REVIEW QUESTIONS  <br>10.1 Using relevant examples, write brief notes o n the following aspects with regard to the King Report III:  <br>10.1. 1 The link between governance principles and law  <br>10.1. 2 The relations hip between good governance, sustainability and corporate citizenship  <br>10.1. 3 The impact of ethics on corporate citizenship  <br>10.1. 4 The major aspects of a stakeholder engagement policy  <br>10.2 Discuss the ILO’s position with regard to child labour.  <br> <br>REFERENCE S <br>Brundtland, G.H. 1987.

Marketing <br>involves creating a pro duct with the needs of customers in mind, then offering it with a competitive price to <br>the consumer. Sales are the activities that sel l that product to the customer. Marketing and sales functions are <br>therefore both needed for successfully selling products to customers. Sales form part of the total marketing <br>effort of a small business. Effective marketing is one of the most demanding chal lenges for small businesses, <br>not only beca use of a lack of marketing knowledge but also because of limited budgets. Market ing includes <br>sales, advertising, promotional activities, pricing and packaging. According to Van Scheers (2011), small <br>businesses are imperative to economies and they need to o ffer their products or services in a way that make <br>them more attractive than the ir competitors to be able to survive. They need to satisfy customers’ needs by <br>the selling of a specific product or the rendering of a  specific service. They should also contin uously research <br>the marketing environment to look for attractive marketing oppor tunities. The purpose of marketing efforts is <br>to establish customers’ needs and combine the capabilities of the small business to fulf il these needs effectively <br>to enable it to  make a profit. The narrow concept of marketing is “selling and advertising”, wh ile more broadly <br>stated it is the “creation and delivery of a standard of living”.  <br>Small -business owners need to decide about a specif ic product or service; how it will be dist ributed; the best <br>marketing communications and the amount they will charge to ma ke a profit. Bowler, Dawood and Page <br>(2007) mention that these four factors, namely: product or service; distribution; marketing commu nication; <br>and price, are known as marketin g-mix elements. Small -business owners, as Dockel and Ligthelm (2012) <br>observe, al so have to decide who to offer the product to in the market as it may only appeal to a certain type <br>of consumer, for example,  a partic ular age group, gender or people earning a  specific level of income. <br>Therefore they have to decide which group of customer s will form their target market. This means that they <br>have to divide the market into separate groups according to age, income, gender and geographic area; this is <br>called market  segmentation.  167 <br> In this chapter the marketing efforts of a small business will be  outlined. The South African small -business <br>marketing environment with its micro and market environments; the marketing concept; the m arketing mix; <br>developing a marketing strat egy; and lastly marketing planning for the South African small business will be <br>described.  <br>11.2 THE SOUTH AFRICAN SMALL -BUSINESS MARKETING ENVIRONMENT  <br>The marketing environment of a small business can be defined as  all the internal and external variables t hat <br>may influence the continued and successful existence of it, as well as the m icro environment and the market <br>environment, as illustrated in  Figure 11.1 . <br>Figur e 11.1 The marketing environment of a South African small business  <br>  <br>11.2.1 The marketing environment of the South African small busi ness  <br>The marketing environment surrounds and has an impact on the small business. There are three key <br>perspectives on the marketing environment, namely the macro environment (described in Chap ter 2) in  section <br>2.7. The elements of  Figure 11.1  will be outlined next.  <br>11.2.1.1 The micro environment  <br>The micro environment or internal environment as Fuller (2012) explains c onsists of the mission statement <br>and objectives of the small bus iness. It also focuses on small -business management, which includes marketing, <br>financial, purchasing and production functi ons and resources such as manpower, capital, know -how and <br>information on the product or service offerings. The mission statement provi des a short description of the <br>product or services offered by the small business while the objectives are practical method s to achieve these <br>objectives. Micro marketing, as Jobber (2010) expla ins, is concerned with the performance of those activities <br>that seek to accomplish a business’s objectives by anticipating customers’ needs and directing a flow of need -<br>satisfying goods and services to customers.  <br>Small -business owners can influence decisio ns regarding resources and have direct control over marketing <br>activities and marketing instruments such as product, distribution, price and marketing communications. <br>168 <br> Typically, marketing  objectives for a particular product might include: increasing product  awareness among <br>targeted consumers; providing information about  product features; and reducing consumer resistance  to <br>buying the product. The marketing objective of a small -business art s-and-crafts shop would be to distinguish <br>its art products from simila r shops in the area. Objectives may also include: new products f or existing markets; <br>existing products for new markets; and new products for new markets. When small -business owners ident ify <br>marketing objectives to support long -term objectives, they should be specific, relevant and measurable.  <br>Small -business owners shou ld be capable of measuring sales volume, sales value, market share and profit. <br>Next the market environment, which includes  the customer, competitors and suppliers, will be defined.  <br>11.2.1.2 Th e market environment  <br>The market environment of a small business consists of the consumer, competitors and suppliers of the small <br>business, which will be discussed next.  <br>The customer  <br>The customers of the small business are consumers using products or services, typically purchasing or renting <br>goods. They have a specific need, purchasing power and behaviour, and have a major impact on business <br>performance through procurement of products and services. Small -business owners need to realise that they <br>have to add value to their products to be competitive in the market. The cus tomers of small businesses are <br>usually local but because of technology advances they can also be global, for example, the customers of a <br>small boutique hotel in the Western Cape. Their customers reserve rooms via social media. Therefore the <br>characteristics  of these customers can be described as connected, borderless and mobile.  <br>Competitors  <br>Small businesses usually have to  compete for customers. The competitors of a small business are other small <br>businesses that are also doing business in the specific market ; for example, the competitors of the small <br>boutique hotel can be self -catering accommodation and other hotels in the area. For small businesses to be <br>successful, they need to develop marketing strategies that offer unique advantages over the competition. They <br>should create a competition grid to establish competitors’ products or services; small businesses’ strengths <br>and weak nesses as well as potential treads. The main goal of the small -business owner is to maintain or <br>improve its position by increasing the  business’s market share.  <br>Suppliers  <br>Suppliers are companies that supply raw material, products, services and finance t o the small business. Small -<br>business owners need to develop close working relations with them because they are important for the survival <br>of the small business.  <br>This environment influences the small business directly. It includes suppliers that deal with t he business <br>directly or indirectly, customers and other local stakeholders. In this concept, market environment describes <br>the relationship  between firms and the driving forces that control this relationship. It is a more local <br>relationship and the firm may  exercise a degree of influence. Marketing knowledge, timely information and <br>market research are imperative for a small business as the pr ediction of future marketing trends will assist in <br>developing effective marketing strategies to survive.  <br>A small busin ess cannot function in seclusion and without interaction with its business environment it will not <br>continue to exist. Environmental change s will continue to determine its success or failure. The SWOT analysis <br>is a valuable tool for the small business to us e during strategic planning and will be discussed next.  169 <br> 11.2.2 The SWOT analysis  <br>The SWOT analysis is a tool for auditing internal factors  in the small business and its environment. It is the <br>first stage of planning and helps small -business owners to focus on key issues such as marketing new products <br>(see Figure 11.2 ). <br>Figure 11.2 SWOT analysi s <br>  <br>Figure 11.2  shows the four components of the SWOT analysis. The acrony m “SWOT” stands for strengths, <br>weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Strengths  and weaknesses are internal factors and opportunities and <br>threats are external. It is a valuable tool to use during strategic planning and it serves as a forerunner for any <br>business action, for example exploring new products, making decisions concerning m arketing  policies, <br>identifying areas for change and dir ecting marketing action plans. The strengths of the SWOT analysis are <br>internal factors including the business vision and m ission, human resources and in -house skills as well as <br>effective and adequate f inancial and human resources. The following are example s of strengths of the small -<br>business owner:  <br>• Small -business owner’s technical expertise  <br>• Financial reserves  <br>• Any IT systems d riving value  <br>• Market research abilities  <br>• New, innovative product or service  <br>• Locat ion of business  <br>• Any other aspect of the small business that adds product or service value  <br>The weaknesses of the SWOT analysis are internal factors such as the small -business own ers’ lack of <br>managerial and marketing skills, funding problems and understaffin g and weak human resources policies. A <br>weakness may inc lude <br>• small -business owner’s lack of marketing expertise  <br>• undifferentiated products and services in relation to competitors  <br>• location of small business  <br>• poor quality goods or customer service  <br>• small business’s damaged reputation.  <br>170 <br> Opportunities offer a small bus iness the means to improve its performance and competitive advantage in a <br>market environment. Threats are factors from the  business’s external environment that can adversely affect its <br>performance and achievement of its objectives. Opportunities and threat s are external factors. An opportunity <br>for a small business may be  <br>• a developing market tool such as the internet  <br>• industry,  market and lifestyle trends  <br>• global influences and import/export c hallenges  <br>• seasonal business trends  <br>• economies of scale and production  volumes  <br>• moving into new market segments that offer improved profits  <br>• new global market opportunities to expand business.  <br>Threats to the small business include changes in competitors, gover nment regulations and customer attitudes. <br>A threat to a small busine ss may be:  <br>• new competitor in the market  <br>• changes in market demand  <br>• new legislative regulations  <br>• political, environmental and economic effects  <br>• strengths of competitors  <br>• changing customer trends  in the market  <br>• evolving technology, for example online shopping  <br>• price wars with competitors  <br>• a competitor has a new, innovative product or service  <br>• competitors have superior access to channels  of distribution.  <br>11.3 THE MARKETING CONCEPT OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN SMALL BUSINESS  <br>Each small business needs a concept to guide its mark eting and selling efforts in order to achieve its marketing <br>objectives. The marketing concept explains how it aims its eff orts at satisfying its customers to acquire a <br>profit. There are five different ma rketing concepts namely: production oriented; sales o riented; marketing <br>oriented; consumer oriented and relationship marketing. These are concepts which were developed as <br>consumers’ needs and focuses change. These concepts will be outlined shortly.  <br>11.3.1 Production -oriented concept  <br>The focus is on producing  as many products as possible and little thought is given to the marketing  of these <br>products because few competitors exist  and consumers are eager to buy. Some small businesses are still <br>production orien tated, for example, arts -and-crafts small businesses.  These small businesses are still producing <br>items without addressing their customers’ specific needs.  <br>11.3.2 Sales -oriente d concept  <br>The focus in this concept is on selling. Whether the consumer really ne eds the product or whether it really met <br>his or her n eeds is not important. This can sometimes lead to unethical sales practices and false promises in <br>order to persuade the co nsumer to buy. The company’s main focus seems to be to get rid of the products, f or <br>example door -to-door products.  171 <br> 11.3.3 Marketing -oriented concept  <br>In this concept the focus is still on selling, but in a more integrated way. The packaging, distribution, q uality <br>and advertising have to be integrated to create a certain product image. T he marketing concept was adopted <br>and it includes thre e principles, namely: consumer and profit orientation and organisational integration.  <br>11.3.4 Consumer -oriented concept  <br>The focus in this concept shifts away from marketing to the consumer. It begins with  product design. Questions <br>asked are: What are the ne eds of the consumer? How should the product, quality, distribution, etc., be designed <br>to meet the needs of the consumer? T his concept includes the concept of marketing orientation, but broadens <br>it consid erably.  <br>11.3.5 Relationship -marketing concept  <br>This co ncept is an extension of the consumer -oriented concept, but places even more emphasis on a long -term <br>relationships with th e consumer, supplier and competitor. This concept extends into the field of publi c <br>relations where a positive relationship with the co mmunity itself is fostered.  <br>Unfortunately, many small -business owners are still stuck at the beginning of the production e ra when there <br>is shortage of most products. They show little interest in the cust omers’ needs and are still production <br>orientated, for  example small businesses in the arts -and-crafts sector, which create products that are easy to <br>make and then try to sell them. Well -managed small businesses, however, have replaced the production -<br>orient ation concept with marketing orientation. Instead of trying to get customers to buy what the business <br>has produced, a marketing -oriented small business offers customers what t hey need. The marketing concept <br>holds that the key to achieving small -business ob jectives is to determine the needs and wants of the t arget <br>markets and delivering these more effectively and efficiently than competitors.  <br>11.4 THE MARKETING MIX FOR SOUTH AFR ICAN SMALL BUSINESSES  <br>The purpose of the marketing mix is to effectively communic ate with the target market of the small business. <br>The small -business owner needs to define each element of the marketing mix, which includes product, price, <br>promotion and plac e. According to Mackintosh and Tynan (2011), the relationship between these eleme nts <br>and how they are used to create targeted strategi es and action plans for the marketing of products or services <br>must be clearly understood. The elements are the marketing “ tactics” and are known as the “four Ps” – price, <br>place, product and promotion, as  illustrated in  Figure 11.3 . 172 <br> Figure 11.3 Marketing mix  <br> <br>As indicated in  Figure 11 .3, the customer is placed in the centre of the four Ps because the customer should <br>be the focal point of all marketing efforts and a ll business efforts.  <br>In popular language, “marketing” is the promotion of products, especially advertising and branding. H owever, <br>in professional language the term has a wider mea ning that recognises that marketing is customer centered. <br>Products are  often developed to meet the desires of groups of customers. The four Ps, namely product, price, <br>promotion and place, will be dis cussed next.  <br>11.4.1 Product or service of the small busin ess <br>Product or service means the need -satisfying offering of a small business  to its target market. Many small -<br>business owners get wrapped up in the technical details involved in producing a product but never stand still <br>to reflect on how customers view the pr oduct. Most customers view a product in terms of the total satisfaction <br>it provides to them. That satisfaction may require a total product offering, which is a combination of excellent <br>service, a  physical product with the right features and useful instruct ions. In essence, the product offering has <br>to reflect the market in which  it operates and should be considered carefully. Attention should also be given <br>to product quality, packaging and valued -added services such as loyalty schemes.  <br>A product may not be a  physical item; it may be a service or may be a combination of goods and services. <br>Goods are tangible and services are not. For example, a sweater is a tangible product, but the dry -cleaning <br>service for the sweater is an example of an intangible product.  <br>Product management and product marketing include aspects of the marketing deal, when the specifications of <br>the actual item or service and how it relates to the consumer’s needs and wants, are give n. The small -business <br>owner needs to answer the following que stions when marketing a product or service.  <br>• What features of the product or service are important to meet customers’ needs?  <br>• How does the product differ from products or services offered by the sm all business’s competitors?  <br>11.4.2 Price  <br>Pricing is one of th e four aspects of the marketing mix and presents many challenges to the s mall business. <br>Small -business owners experience difficulties when pricing their products or services. Pricing is the proce ss <br>of applying prices to purchase and sales orders, based on factors such as: a fixed amount, quantity break, <br>promotion or sales campa ign. <br>173 <br> The price of the product is the amount that a customer is prepared to pay for it. It must be relevant to the <br>product/ service and the competition in the market. When estimating th e price of the product or service, the <br>small -business owner needs to cons ider value and benefits to the customer and differentiate its product from <br>the competition. Knowing the competitors and th eir practices is essential as is pricing the product. The sma ll-<br>business owner needs to answer the following questions when establishi ng a price:  <br>• How much did it cost to produce the product?  <br>• What is the customers’ perceived product value?  <br>• Can the current p rice of the product keep up with the price of the product’s c ompetitors?  <br>For the marketing mix to be right, the price must also be rig ht! The right price comes from properly managing <br>the pricing process, starting with an understanding of the overall market ing strategy and having the right price <br>objectives. The prici ng process is just as complex as the management process and needs to cons ider the <br>following:  <br>• Flexibility of the price  <br>• Life-cycle status of the product  <br>• Product discounts  <br>• Location and geography of the small business  <br>11.4.2.1 Different pricing strategies  <br>Premium pricing  <br>The small -business owner will set a high price where there is  uniqueness about the product or the service it is <br>selling. This approach is used when a substantial competitive advantage  exists. High prices are charged for <br>luxury items.  <br>Penetr ation pricing  <br>Small -business owners will price the products and services at a n artificially low price in order to gain market <br>share. Once this is achieved, the price is increased.  <br>Economy pricing  <br>The small -business owner may consider a no -frills low price.  The cost of marketing and  manufacture are kept <br>to a minimum. Small supermark ets often have economy brands for items like soups and spaghetti, which are <br>priced low.  <br>Price skimming  <br>The small -business owner can charge a high price because its product has a s ubstantial competitive advantage <br>in the market. However, the advantage is not  sustainable because the high price tends to attract new <br>competitors into the market, and the price inevitably falls due t o increased supply. Small manufacturers of <br>digital watche s used a skimming approach in the 1970s but once other small manufacturers we re tempted into <br>the market, the watches were produced at a lower unit cost, and the prices for these watches had to drop. <br>Premium pricing, penetration pricing, economy pricing and  price skimming are the four main pricing <br>policies/strategies for the small b usiness.  <br>Psychological pricing  <br>This approach is used when the small -business owner wants the consumer to respond on an emo tional, rather <br>than rational basis, for example when a “p rice point perspective” is 99 cents and not one rand.  174 <br> Product -line pricing  <br>Where there is a range of products or services, the pricing reflects the benefits of parts of the range. This <br>encourages peo ple to buy more from a range when there are special offe rs. An example would be a small <br>business offering car washes. A basic wash cou ld cost R40, and a wash and wax R100, but customers might <br>be incentivised to take the whole package for only R120 and rece ive both a wash and wax for this price.  <br>Optional product  pricing  <br>The small -business owner will attempt to increase the amount customer s spend once they start to buy in their <br>shop. Optional “extras” increase the overall price of the product or service and t he small -business owner can <br>benefit from the customers’ increased spending.  <br>11.4.3 Promotion  <br>Promotion, marketing communication and ad vertising are all tools that are implemented by small -business <br>owners to differentiate themselves and their products from their competition. Promotion is one of the four <br>aspects of the marketing mix and includes advertising, sales promotion, publicity and personal selling. It refers <br>to the various methods of promoting the product, brand or service. The small -business owner ne eds to decide <br>which promotion methods to use to successf ully reach its aimed target market. Promotion refers to those <br>promotion activi ties, other than advertising, publicity and personal selling, that stimulate interest, trial or <br>purchase by final customer s or others in the channel. Advertising and sales promot ion are often important <br>parts of a promotion blend but in most blends personal  selling also plays an important role. Promotion is only <br>a part of the total marketing mix a small -business owner has to d evelop to promote a product offering to target <br>customers . <br>11.4.3.1 Promotion techniques  <br>According to Perreault and McCarthy (2013), ex amples of sales -promotion techniques aimed at consumers <br>include the following:  <br>Samples  <br>Samples are given out free to custo mers or retailers to enable them to try a new product of service. For <br>example, a butcher may braai boerewors outside the butchery to l et potential customers taste his or her <br>boerewors.  <br>Premiums  <br>With premiums customers get  something free in, or attached to,  a pack or by returning something to the <br>manufacturer. For example, a real -estate agency may offer free books to those customers who v isit a new <br>apartment complex selling units.  <br>Price deals  <br>A price deal is any short -term discount given to customers. For ex ample, a hardware store may offer an extra <br>10 per cent discount to the builders at a new construction site in the area for a  period of  months. Remember <br>though that price deals are easily copied, must be handled with care and should be for a short period of  time <br>only.  <br>Rebates  <br>In terms of rebates customers get some of their money back by filling in a form. For example, a curtain <br>manufactur er may offer a certain cash amount back to purchasers when they send in a card included  in a ready -<br>made curtain pack.  175 <br> Coup ons <br>Coupons allow customers to save money or get a free item. For example, a catering small business may offer <br>a coupon for a free bot tle of wine if the customer buys the first bottle.  <br>Sponsorship of special events  <br>Sponso rship of special events aims to bui ld a positive image for, or expose customers to, the business. For <br>example, a clothing small business may sponsor the local high schoo l soccer team and gain exposure for the <br>business.  <br>Special sales  <br>Special sales include s uch popular sales as back -to-school , anniversary and clearance sales. Small retailers <br>often use this sales promotion technique.  <br>Contests and games  <br>Contests and games are  an attempt to build customer loyalty by getting customers to make repeat visits. For <br>example, a video small business may offer a free video contract as a prize for those customers who enter by <br>signing their receipts from the store and putting them in a sp ecial container: the winner is drawn from the <br>container at a certain date. Care needs t o be taken by the small -business ow ners because using contests and <br>games in sales promotion has legal implications.  <br>11.4.3.2 Emarketing  <br>Emarketing involves using electro nic methods, which affects traditional marketing in two ways. First, it <br>increases effic iency in established marketing func tions and, second, the technology of emarketing transforms <br>many marketing mix elements, resulting in new business models that add cust omer value and/or increase <br>company profitability. The internet is described as the SME’ s gateway to global markets and e -business is <br>expected to allow SMEs to gain capabilities that were once the preserve of their larger competitors. There are <br>different em arketing communication methods that can be used, for example word -of-mouth (electronic and <br>traditional), buzz marketing an d viral marketing.  <br>Word of mouth  <br>Word of mouth, both traditional (WOM) and electronic (e -WOM), is a cost effective advertising method suited <br>to the small business. With traditional WOM, satisfied consumers spread positive  information about the <br>business, wh ereas e -WOM is when electronic communication is posted on the internet that influences <br>consumers’ judgement of reviewed SME products. Both are excellent forms of advertising and can be more <br>effective than formal advertisi ng because they are more credible a nd are trusted by other potential clients.  <br>Buzz marketing  <br>Buzz marketing is when the SME creates an outstanding event that generates p ublicity and excitement, and <br>gives information to the consumer. It focuses on maximisi ng the WOM potential by discussions on social <br>media platforms.  <br>Viral marketing  <br>Viral marketing is when an SME uses viral marketing to advertise its product. An email with  a marketing <br>message is sent from a portal such as Hotmail and spreads very quickly among consumers.  176 <br> 11.4.4 Place (distrib ution)  <br>According to Perreault and McCarthy (2013), place or distribution refers to how the product gets to the <br>customer, for example a  pointof -sale placement or local small business sale. This fourth “P” refers to “where” <br>a product or service is sold, for instance in which geographic  region or indu stry and to which segment the <br>buyers belong (young adults, families, business people, women , men, etc.).  <br>Distribution is one of the four aspects of the marketing mix. A distribution small business is the middleman  <br>between the manufacturer and retailer, or (usually) in commercial or industrial, the business customer. After <br>a product is manufactur ed by a supplier/factory, it is typically stored in a distribution company’s warehouse. <br>The product is then sold to retail ers or customers. The other three parts of the marketing mix are product, <br>pricing and promotion. Traditionally, distribution has been seen as dealing with logistics: how to get the <br>product or service to the customer. The place forms the last of the four de cision -making areas of the marketing <br>mix. <br>Some authors increase the mix to the “five Ps” to include people. Others will increase the m ix to “seven Ps” <br>to include physical evidence (such as uniforms, facilities or livery) and process (i.e. the whole custome r <br>experience, e.g. a visit to Disney World) . <br>An example of a marketing mix for a small fashion shop is indicated in  Table 11.1 . <br>Table 11.1 The marketing mix within the retail industry  <br>Elements of the <br>marketing m ix Description  <br>Customer -service <br>capability  The level at which the small fashion shop delivers quality service, provides q uality products and <br>handles its customer complaints. It is always essential that any promises, or perceived promises <br>through advertisi ng, are delivered upon.  <br>Store -image <br>differentiation  The degree that the small fashion shop’s external store image and its  merchandising image are <br>unique and consistent with the image portrayed to the target market.  <br>External market -<br>level knowledge  The ext ent of a small fashion -shop owner’s understanding of current and potential customers, <br>competitors and industry trends.  <br>Promotional <br>capability  How does the small fashion -shop owner differentiate his or her store through advertising and <br>promotions?  <br>Source:  Strydom (2009: 78)  <br> <br>Considering the intensity of competition that fashion -shop owners face from season to season, strength s and <br>capabilities in each of these areas combined into an overall strong strategy will assist the small fashion -shop <br>owner in meeting  the needs of the targeted customer.  <br>11.4.5 Benefit of the marketing mix  <br>The small business does not operate in isolation;  it relies on the wants and needs of consumers in the market <br>environment, therefore it needs to consider the components of the marketi ng mix to be able to know how and <br>when to promote products and services. For example, a cleaning small business will want to promote its <br>service at a strong price point before major holidays when demand is higher, but when the timing or place is <br>different,  it might consider increasing the amount of business it receives by offering a low price incentive. 177 <br> After creating a marke ting mix, the small -business owner may want to consider the pricing strategies <br>depending on the product type and product -cycle stage.  <br>11.5 DEVELOPING A MARKETING STRATEGY FOR A SMALL BUSINESS  <br>Marketing strategy planning can be defined as finding attractive  opportunities and developing profitable <br>marketing strategies. As Parrot, Roomi and Holliman (2010) explain, strategic management incl udes strategic <br>planning and strategic control. Strategic planning describes the marketing activities performed by the smal l-<br>business owner to address changes in its external environments. It involves formulating and evaluating <br>alternative strategies, selec ting new strategies, and developing detailed plans for implementing the strategy. <br>Strategic planning consists of formulati ng strategies from which overall plans for implementing the strategy <br>are developed, whereas strategic control ensure that the chosen s trategy is being implemented properly and <br>that it is producing the desired results. Marketing  strategy, according to Pearc e and Robinson (2010), refers to <br>the unique and differentiable positioning of the small business towards its customer’s needs. The sma ll-<br>business owner needs to clearly understand the market environment within which it operates, know the <br>customer, and reco gnise the competitor’s strengths and weaknesses. It needs to tactically align its own <br>resources and capabilities to meet customers’ ne eds profitably. Ries and Trout (2012) observe that marketing <br>strategy is a process of: identifying customer needs; concept ualising those needs in terms of an organisation’s <br>capacity to produce; communicating that conceptualisation to the appropriate laws o f power in the <br>organisation; conceptualising the consequent output in terms of the customer needs identified earlier; and <br>communicating that conceptualisation to the customer. Ries and Trout (2012) assume that the small business <br>with the best marketing res earch capability will win the marketing war. This marketing philosophy is based <br>on a singular notion of customer focus, an  obsession withwhich becomes problematic particularly when every <br>small business becomes customer -oriented and seeks to serve the same customer needs. In this scenario the <br>race for marketing becomes a defeatist one -prize -race, where there can only be one wi nner. Kotler and <br>Sawhney (2012) take the dimensions of marketing -strategy innovation further as they look at the new <br>marketing concept s for our times, as indicated in  Table 11.2 . <br>Table 11.2 Dimensions of the marketing strategy for a small fashion shop  <br>Conventional marketing strategy  The new marketing strategy  <br>Organise by produc t units  Organise by customer segments  <br>Focus on profitable transactions  Focus on customer lifetime value  <br>Judge performance primarily by financial results  Look at marketing metrics as well as financial ones  <br>Focus on satisfying shareholders  Focus on satisf ying several stakeholder groups  <br>The marketing person does the marketing  Everyone in the company does marketing  <br>Build brands primaril y through advertising  Build brands through company behaviour  <br>Emphasise customer acquisition  Emphasise customer retention  <br>Measure customer satisfaction  Measure customer value and loyalty  178 <br> Conventional marketing strategy  The new marketing strategy  <br>Over -promise to get the order  Under -promise to over deliver  <br>Make t he small business the unit of analysis  Make the value chain the unit of analysis  <br>Source:  Sawhney & Kotler (2012)  <br>Table 11.2  shows the new concept of creating a marketing strategy. An important point  mentioned is that <br>everyone in the small business should market their products or services.  <br>11.6 MARKETING PLAN FOR A SMALL BUSINESS  <br>An important procedure involved in any successful  small -business operation is creating and implementing a <br>marketing plan. A  marketing plan is an essential plan to implement and control the marketing activities of a <br>small business.  <br>11.6.1 Marketing -plan plan ning <br>A marketing plan is a written statement or  market strategy and the time -related activities for carrying out this <br>strategy. Before writing the marketing plan for the small business, it is necessary to define and understand the <br>needs of the target marke t. This involves conducting market research by using customer circulation records, <br>user surveys, focus -group interviews an d information interviews to provide insight on what the customers <br>really want. It should spell out the following:  <br>• What marketing mix w ill it offer, to whom (i.e. the target market) and for how long  <br>• What company resources (shown as costs) will be needed and  at what rate  <br>• What results are expected (sales, profit and customer satisfaction levels)  <br>The plan should also include control procedur es to control the marketing -plan activities. After a marketing <br>plan is developed a small -business owner will know how to i mplement the plan. The marketing plan is <br>generally undertaken for one of the following re asons:  <br>1. The marketing plan is needed as part o f the yearly planning process within the marketing functional <br>area.  <br>2. The marketing plan is needed for a specialised strateg y to introduce something new, such as new <br>product planning, entering new markets, or tryi ng a new strategy to fix an existing problem.  <br>3. The marketing plan is a component within an overall business plan, such as a new business proposal to <br>the financial commu nity.  <br>Therefore before writing the marketing plan, small -business owners should answer th e following questions:  <br>1. What is the product or  service they are selling?  <br>2. Who is their market that will buy the product or service?  <br>3. What need does the market have for th eir specific product or service?  <br>4. What is the basic message that they would like to send t o this market with regard to their product?  <br>5. What is the best way of getting in contact with their projected market? (For example, which advertising <br>media such as TV, r adio, print or online should be considered?)  <br>After answering the above questions they wil l be ready to start their marketing plans. Wh en, answering <br>question five, small -business owners should keep in mind their budget limitations.  179 <br> 11.6.2 Components of the marketing plan  <br>A marketing plan outlines the specific actions the small business intends to carry out to interest potential <br>customers in its product and/or service and persuade them to buy the product and/or services it offers. The <br>marketing -plan component s describe the small business’s marketing strategy. The marketing strategy provides <br>the g oals for the marketing plans and serves as a roadmap to achieve goals as indicated in  Figure 11.4 . <br>Figure 11.4 The components of the small -business marketing plan  <br> <br>In Figure 11.4  the components of the marke ting plan are illustrated and they will be discussed next.  <br>11.6.2.1 Mission and vision statements  <br>The mission statement cl early and succinctly describes the nature of the business, services offered and target <br>markets. It is combined with the vision and mis sion statements of the small business. A mission statement <br>clarifies the “what” and “who” of a sma ll business, whereas a v ision statement explains the “why” and “how” <br>as well. For example, SmartChoice, which is an online shop, will have the following visio n statement:  <br>Our vision is to give our customers the best online shopping experience with a user -friendly searchable <br>websi te, easy -to-follow instructions, secure payment methods, and quality delivery.  <br>When designing a mission statement, the small business should keep in mind the following. It should be  <br>• realistic  <br>• specific  <br>• related to a specific market en vironment  <br>• based on disti nctive competencies  <br>• motivating.  <br>An example of a mission statement for the above -mentioned SmartChoice online shop might be:  <br>Provide an  online shopping experience with good -quality products.  <br>11.6.2.2 Product or service offered  <br>Identi fy the services the cust omers of the small business need; the current services offered and then establish <br>new services it wishes to provide. The small -busines s owner also needs to determine whether it can provide <br>the services in terms of staff, expertise a nd costs.  <br>180 <br> 11.6.2.3 Marke ting strategies and objectives  <br>The small -business owner needs to understand what makes a customer want to use or buy a product or serv ice <br>and also what type of marketing strategy would be appropriate. It needs to establish the needs , problems, <br>industry tre nds and environment that will affect and influence the customer. The following are strategies, <br>which could be implemented by small -business owners.  <br>• Network, either in person or electronically, by participating in discussion groups o nline where their target  <br>markets congregate.  <br>• Direct marketing involves sending out sales letters, capability brochures, flyers, or special offers on a regular , <br>repeated basis to the same group of prospects.  <br>• Advertise in print media or directories, often wi th a specific offer to r eap the benefit of an immediate <br>response or sale. Advertising lends credibility (image advertising) and, like direct marketing, must b e <br>continuous.  <br>• Devise training programmes that increase awareness about their services.  <br>• Write artic les for the local media or professional journals and newsletters that describe the benefits of their <br>services.  <br>• Direct or personal selling is called one -on-one selling and is often done on site at a prospect’s office or <br>company. Direct sales are a particula rly costly form of marke ting since only one person is reached at a <br>time.  <br>• Send out publicity and press releases through local newspapers, radio and television stations.  <br>• Participate in trade shows at a local or regional level.  <br>11.6.2.4 Situation analysis  <br>The situation analysis incl udes a market analysis, SWOT analysis and a competitive analysis.  <br>The competitive environment of the small -business’s market is outlin ed in this  section. This includes any <br>competitors, whether they are in direct or indirect competition. The situation analy sis looks at the macro <br>environmental factors that affect many small businesses within the environment and the micro environmental <br>factors that s pecifically affect the small business. The purpose of the situation analysis is to indicate to a small <br>business the business situation and product position. The overall survival challenges of the business within <br>the environment are also indicated . Small -business owners should be able to summarise opportunities and <br>problems within their environment so they can unders tand their capabilities within the market. Several <br>methods of analysing can be used, such as the 5Cs analysis, SWOT analysis and Porte r five for ces analysis. <br>Small businesses need a detailed marketing plan to survive in increasingly competitive markets.  <br>11.6.2.5 Monitor results  <br>Small -business owners need to monitor results after implementing their marketing plan. They need to <br>determine w hich marke ting strategies are generating sales. This involves tracking and evaluating customers’ <br>responses to each marketi ng strategy. Surveys or interviews can be used to get this information from regular <br>customers.  <br>11.7 CONCLUSION  <br>Marketing and sales are  essential  marketing components of a small business’s survival efforts in the market. <br>In this chapter, the marketing progr amme of the small business was outlined. The small business blends all <br>the marketing -mix tools into a comprehensive marketing programm e that com municates and delivers the <br>intended value to target customers. In this chapter, the South African small -business  marketing environment, <br>the marketing concept, the marketing mix, marketing strategy development, and lastly the marketing plan <br>were o utlined.  181 <br> REVIEW QUESTIONS  <br>11.1 Define the marketing environment of a South African small business.  <br>11.2 Draw a diagram of the marketing environment of a small business.  <br>11.3 Small -business owners need to decide about a specific product or service; how it w ill be dis tributed; the best marketing <br>communications and the amount they will charge to make a profit.

They have interests that affect the business and can also be affected by the activities of the small <br>business. Stakeholders include e mployees, labour unions, suppliers , customers, business partners, investors <br>and shareholders, the local community, government authorities and regulators. It should be c lear to the small -<br>business owner that various stakeholders have different interests, att itudes and priorities and that <br>communication methods should be tailor -made for each group. This will guarantee that they receive <br>information that is applicable to their  different needs, and which will create positive attitudes towards the <br>small business. S mall-business owners should always  be working on developing and sustaining long -term <br>relations with their stakeholders. As such, relationship marketing needs to be enco uraged.  <br>Relationship marketing involves creating, maintaining and enhancing long -term re lationships with all <br>stakeholders of the business to obtain mutual benefits. It is imperative for the small -business owner to <br>communicate with stakeholders. This will a ssist in generating a positive understanding of the small business. <br>Communicating regula rly with customers, for example,  will keep the small business in the front of the <br>customer’s mind when they make purchasing decisions. On the other hand, open communica tions with <br>suppliers will help to develop a supply chain aligned with the small business ’s needs. Small businesses should <br>focus on marketing communications to communicate these different messages to stakeholders. Marketing <br>communications are defined as mes sages and related media used to communicate with a specific stakeholder <br>market. It is th e small business’s ultimate object ive to ensure that all the elements of marketing <br>communications (advertising, sales promotion, public relations, direct marketing, per sonal selling, online 184 <br> communications and social media) support each other and work toget her. Marketing communications is t he <br>promotion part of the “marketing mix” or the “four Ps”: price, place, promotion and product, discussed <br>in Chapter 11 . In this chapter, stakeholder communications and building relationships for small a business <br>will be described.  The role of marketing communications in stakeholder communications, the elements of <br>small-business marketing communicatio ns and lastly, internet marketing for a small business will be reflected <br>on. <br>12.2 SMALL -BUSINESS STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS AND BUILDI NG <br>RELATIONSHIPS  <br>A small -business stakeholder can be defined as any party that is involv ed with the business, whether inte rnal <br>or external, that can be affected by the outcome or impact of the business’s actions, as illustrated in  Figure <br>12.1. <br>Figure 12.1 Small -business stakeholders  <br> <br> <br>As illustrated in  Figure 12.1 , the small business has different groups of stakeholders. Internal stakeholders, <br>such as stockholders , customers, suppliers, creditors and employees are those within the small business who <br>benefit financially from their con tributions to the business’s success. External stakeholders consist of the <br>following groups, namely: the general public, engaged commu nities, activist groups and the media. Marketing <br>communications are used to communicate messages to the different stakehol ders. They can be divided into <br>internal flows and external flows directed at different target stakeholders. Marketing communications a ssist <br>the small -business owner to focus efforts in acquiring, retaining and developing r elationships with customers <br>and ot her stakeholders. Perceptions that customers have of the small business are created by messages they <br>receive through: media advertisem ents; price; package design; direct -marketing efforts; publicity; sales <br>promotions and w ebsites.  <br>185 <br> The stakeholder’s marketi ng-communication plan assists the small -business owner in communicating the <br>correct information to the correct target group on time. I t also creates a communications events list to guarantee <br>that stakeholders are well info rmed. Small -business owners have t o: <br>• List the communications stakeholders  <br>• Define each stakeholder’s communications needs  <br>• Identify the required communications events  <br>• Determine the method and frequency of each event  <br>• Allocate resources to communications event s <br>• Build a communications events sc hedule.  <br>This will assist in monitoring communications; getting feedback on communications events and improve <br>communications processes in the future.  <br>12.2.1 Customer relationship management in the context of the small busin ess <br>Customer relationship manageme nt (CRM) combines all aspects of sales, marketing and service -related <br>activities that an SME can use to promote its products to custom ers. CRM is beneficial to SMEs because it <br>can improve customer relations and loyalty.  <br>It can  also assist the SME to learn the value of its customers and improve relationships with them. The SME <br>can find out customers’ purchasing habits and preferences, and  profile them, which will increase marketing <br>efforts and sales. The benefits of CRM include a personal approach to custome rs and also that marketing <br>communications can be aimed at specific customer needs.  <br>12.3 SMALL -BUSINESS STAKEHOLDER MARKETING COMMUNICA TIONS  <br>Small -business stakeholder marketing communications can be described as a cross -functi onal process for <br>creating a pr ofitable relationship with customers and other stakeholders. This can be done by strategically <br>controlling or influencing all messages  sent to these groups and encouraging data -driven, purposeful dialogue <br>with them. The small -business owner conveys the inf ormation about the product or service with a view not <br>only to inform the customer, but also to persuade or remind them to adapt a favo urable attitude towards the <br>product or service. Marketing communication is also a process wh ereby information about an org anisation <br>and its offerings is disseminated to selected stakeholder groups.  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 186 <br> Figure 12.2 Small -business stakeholder marketing communica tions  <br> <br> <br>12.3.1 Marketing communication methods  <br>Marketing communication methods may vary dep ending on the situation of the  individual small business. <br>Marketing communication has evolved from production and sales centred to customer and relationship -<br>focused  marketing. The small -business owner should strive to establish long -lasting relationships w ith its <br>stakeholders. The most  widely cited marketing communication method for small business is networking. <br>Networking has been identified as vital to develop smal l-business marketing strategies. Hill and Wright <br>(2009) suggest that the marketing communica tion of a small business is ce ntred on customer engagement, <br>networking and word -of-mouth communication with web -based marketing emerging as a key area. Small <br>busine sses execute a significant number of marketing activities, ranging from traditional marketin g <br>communication, such as trade  and consumer press advertising, to viral marketing and website search engine <br>optimisation. They also engage in promotional activities  such as customer networking, exhibitions and the <br>use of databases for customer identificati on. Marketing communication fa ctors include factors such as <br>persuasion, marketing communication objectives and contact points, all of which will be discussed next.  <br>• Marketing communication tries to persuade the target audience to change attitudes and also p rovides <br>information. The small  business can persuade a customer in a variety of ways, including providing <br>incentives, giving reasons why a product should be purchas ed or supplying information on a certain <br>product’s uses.  <br>• Marketing communication objectives involve creating brand awarene ss, delivering information, educating <br>the market and advancing a positive image for the business or product.  <br>• Contact points are points  where the customer and small business’s product come into direct contact with <br>each other. S uccessful marketing requires m anaging and coordinating marketing message at every <br>contact point. Although marketers can plan and relay messages to target audiences frequently, they need <br>to ensure that messages at every contact point work together so that t hey persuade consumers to <br>purc hase products.  <br>Promotion, advertising and public relations are marketing -communication methods that small businesses can <br>utilise to di fferentiate themselves and their products from their competition. These marketing -<br>communicat ion methods will be outlined i n this chapter.  <br>187 <br> 12.3.2 Promotion  <br>Promotion refers to activities that create awareness, and generate sales and brand loyalty for the sm all <br>business. Traditionally these activities included advertising, personal selling, sales p romotions, direct <br>marketing, p ublic relations and sponsorships, but new technologies and activities such as websites, social <br>media and emails are implemented nowada ys as well.  <br>Promotion forms part of the marketing mix (product, price, promotion and place),  which needs to be <br>developed f or specific target customers. Sales promotions can generate sales by implementing sales -<br>promotion techniques such as organising contes ts, attending trade shows and distributing sales brochures.  <br>12.3.3 Sales -promotion techniques  <br>According to Hill and Wright  (2009), sales -promotion techniques are the following:  <br>• Contests:  in terms of contests, you award a prize to the person who sells the m ost products/services. For <br>example, the top salesperson migh t win a prize of a free weekend at a holiday resort.  <br>• Trade sho ws: make use of display booths set up by small -buisiness owners to display their products to <br>prospective customers. The Pretoria Show often has many small -business people presenting their <br>produc ts. Specific areas of business have their own trade shows, and  small -business owners should find <br>out if these are available in their areas. Examples of these shows include Decorex (interior decora ting), <br>Buildex (builders) and Computer Faire (computers and related technology).  <br>• Sales brochures:  allow small -business own ers to provide information on their products to customers. For <br>example, a hiking -boot manufacturer may print a brochure explaining the  qualities and special features of <br>its boots and distribute these to those who are interested. It is always difficult to j udge the effectiveness <br>of the sales promotion, but there are a number of areas that can establish whether or not the sales <br>promotion w as successful (Marx & Van der Walt, 2003: 448) such as  <br>– positive reactions by the sales force  <br>– increases in sales patter ns <br>– increase in market share  <br>– positive opinion of customers  <br>– high number of queries received from customers.  <br>It is very important t o keep a record of the effect of sales promotions on the small business. Keep track of <br>results bef ore, during and after th e promotion. These results need to be analysed to determine if objectives <br>were reached and which method, or combination of methods, wa s most effective. Next advertising as a <br>marketing -communication method will be discussed.  <br>12.3.4 A dvertising  <br>Advertising c an be defined as any non -personal form of mass communication about a product or service, <br>which is paid for by an organisation or an id entified sponsor. Bowler, Dawood and Page (2007) agree with <br>this and mention that adverting is usu ally delivered through m ass communication. The key differentiating <br>elements that define advertising are that it is a paid -for message, and the message is cont rolled by the <br>advertiser. Advertising is a marketing activity that uses creative marketing techniq ues to design persuasive  <br>communication in mass media. It promotes ideas, goods and services in a manner consistent with the <br>achievement of the advertiser’s ob jectives, the delivery of consumer satisfaction, and the development of <br>social and economic welfar e. Before spending vast amounts of money, businesses must understand the <br>value, advantages and disadvantages of advertising. Advertising costs money and there fore the advantages <br>and disadvantages must be analysed to see if it is worth it for a small busine ss to advertise.  188 <br> 12.3.4. 1 Value of advertising  <br>The value of advertising is that it helps people identify and remember the value and function of a product or <br>service. This is done by providing positive information on the product, service, brand, manufacture r of the <br>product and its  uses. The major value of advertising is that it helps to sell products and helps companies <br>build a product brand.  <br>12.3.4.2 Advantages  of advertising  <br>The advantage of advertising is that it can reach a large target market and help a  small business  build a <br>larger demand for the product. Advertising helps in the customer decision -making process by providing <br>customers with the necessary inf ormation to make a purchase. It also helps customers compare products <br>from other organisations. Ot her advantages are that advertising allows small -business owners to reach <br>potential customers when personal selling is not possible. Using advertising also al lows small -business <br>owners to advertise a product in a creative way, thereby allowing them to crea te an image in the custo mers’ <br>minds in a way that sales personnel are not necessarily able to do. Bowler, Dawood and Page (2007) also <br>claim that another advan tage of advertising is that it can be used in the creation of brand awareness and <br>brand preference . <br>12.3.4.3 Disadvantages  of advertising  <br>Despite the advantages described in  section 1 2.3.4.2  there are severa l disadvantages of advertising. <br>Customers often feel that advertising is intrusive and many people will block out what they hear and s ee on <br>adverts and will not retain the information they have seen. There are many small businesses advertising <br>every day, m any of these products are extremely similar, and a small business’s product can be lost in the <br>mass of competing products being advert ised. Du Plessis and Boon (2014) call this “advertising clutter”. <br>Advertising can be very expensiv e and smaller companies often cannot afford it. Measuring whether <br>advertising has been effective is also very difficult, mainly due to the fact that it does n ot lead to an <br>immediate response or buying action from customers. However, advertising can also re ach the wrong target <br>audience, which is a waste of money.  <br>12.3.4.4 Advertising objectives  <br>Advertising objectives are important to a small business because the y will encourage the introduction and <br>selection of consistent advertising alternatives and they offer the firm a standard against which the results of <br>the advertising can be evaluated. Adv ertising can also be used to support other elements in the marketing  <br>mix. This can improve the effectiveness of the firm’s total marketing strategy with the ultimate objective of <br>increasing sales.  <br>Advertising objectives are specific outcomes that are to be  accomplished through advertising. The following <br>are different objec tives small -business owners might want to obtain from their advertising campaigns:  <br>• Increasing the number of customers:  advertising can help a small business to be able to turn non -users in to <br>users, attract users from competitor’s brands and help former use rs to become interested in a particular <br>product again.  <br>• Increasing total demand:  a small business may use an advertising ca mpaign in order to increase the total <br>demand for a product so that  the small business’s share will generate sales volumes.  <br>• Attracting non-users:  a small business’s advertising campaign’s objective may be to attract non -users in an <br>effort to increase the nu mber of customers.  <br>• Maintaining current sources:  a small business c an achieve an increase in sales by creating brand loyalty or <br>by disc ouraging brand switching. Reinforcing a positive purchase experience or helping to avoid a negative <br>experience can achieve  this.  <br>• Rekindling interest in a mature product:  advertising campai gns can be used to rekindle interest in a mature <br>product and encoura ge an increase in sales.  189 <br> • Rediscovering former users:  a small business may find many former users no longer want their prod uct or <br>switch to a generic product.  <br>• Attracting users of competitor ’s brands:  small -business advertising can imply that their product i s better <br>than the competitor’s product, thereby attracting customers from the competitor.  <br>• Increasing the usage rate:  a sma ll business can make use of advertising in order to increase the u sage rate of <br>companion products. A small business can generate an in crease in sales by increasing the usage rate of their <br>product.  <br>• Increasing the frequency of use:  advertising can be used by  a small business to make consumers aware of <br>the fact that their product can be used more often. For example, advertising can make peo ple aware of the <br>fact that  the product can be used once a week and not only once a month.  <br>• Reducing the time between purcha ses: advertising can be used by a small business to convince people to <br>buy their product sooner than they usually would.  <br>• Marketing -mix objectives:  when a small business wishes to introduce a new product, a product <br>modification, or a new package, an adverti sing campaign is usually prepared to provide support.  <br>12.3.4.5 Factors to consider when choosing an advertising medium  <br>A small busines s’s choice of advertising media will depend on why it is advertising. Choosing the best media <br>for a small business’s adver tising depends on four factors. According to Du Plessis, Bothma, Jordaan and Van <br>Heerden (2009), these factors are:  <br>1. The objective:  wha t a small business wants to achieve from advertising and in what time frame. The <br>objectives of the advertising must be cle arly documented. These objectives must be realistic, achievable <br>and should be something that advertising can accomplish.  <br>2. The target au dience:  who and where the people are that the message should reach through advertising. <br>The audience the small business wo uld l ike to reach must be carefully selected and then an advertising <br>medium chosen that would best appeal to that target audience. Nar rowing down the audience can aid <br>the small business in making wise and cost -efficient media choices.  <br>3. The message and frequ ency:  what does the small business want to say and how often does it need to <br>be said? The most effective medium that will carry the me ssage must be chosen. For example, if a small <br>business has a large amount of information to convey about a product or serv ice, a 30 -second radio spot <br>would be not feasible.  <br>4. The budget:  budget is probably the single most influential factor in an advertising  plan. For an <br>advertisement to be effective, it needs to be displayed frequently. Thus an advertising medium must be <br>chose n tha t will allow for regular exposure. The medium chosen must be cost -effective enough for the <br>small business to use it several times . It will not be beneficial, for example, for a small business to spend <br>all its advertising expenditure on one TV advertis ement . <br>According to Baines, Fill and Page (2008), every rand that is saved is precious for small businesses and an <br>advertising medium that will give the greatest return for their investment should be chosen. An advertising <br>campaign should translate into gr eater  sales and more profit. There are three important questions a business <br>owner must answer when choosing an advertising medium for an advertising campaign:  <br>1. Where are the target buyers?  <br>2. What is the best medium to reach them?  <br>3. Can the small -business owner affor d to launch an effective advertising campaign using this medium?  <br>Selecting the right advertising medium to send out the message i s an important step in developing a sales and <br>marketing plan.  <br>12.3.5 Advertising mediums  <br>Media is defined as a communicati ons c hannel or a group of channels used to convey information, news, <br>entertainment and advertising messages to an audience (Du Plessis  et al., 2009). Choosing the right medium <br>to carry a small business’s message is critical for the success of a small busin ess’s  advertising.  190 <br> There are two major advertising media: broadcast media such as television and radio, and print media such as <br>newspa pers, magazines, billboards, direct mail and leaflets (Du Plessis et al., 2009). Television, radio, <br>newspapers, magazines,  out-of-home advertising, direct response and direct -mail advertising are all forms of <br>advertising media. Mass media such as newspaper s, magazines, radio and television are especially well suited <br>to delivering advertisements. Mass media is important becaus e it is able to deliver to large audiences at a <br>relatively low cost. It can deliver advertisements to special types of audiences who a re attracted to each <br>medium’s editorial or programming, and media tend to develop strong loyalties among audiences who ret urn <br>to them with a high degree of regularity.  <br>Advertising is transmitted through channels  that permit the message to reach a large aud ience simultaneously. <br>These channels are called mass media and are broadly classified as print or broadcast. Cohen (2008) claim s <br>that the largest share of advertising expenditure is allocated to newspapers. The largest expenditure for national <br>advertising,  however, occurs in television. Direct mail is the third -largest medium in terms of advertising <br>expenditure.  <br>12.3.5.1 Tele vision <br>Television was introduced into South Africa as a mass medium in 1975, but only in 1977 was it used as an <br>advertising medium (Du  Plessis et al., 2009). Television is the single most powerful medium on which a small <br>business can advertise. Seventy per  cent of people in Soweto watch television regularly; therefore television <br>is a very good advertising medium for a target market such as Soweto (Morris, 2002: 92).  <br>Table 12.1 Advantages and disadvantages of television  <br>Advantages  Disadvantages  <br>• High i mpact  <br>• Stimulates most of the senses  <br>• Carries a certain prestige  <br>• Can reach a large audience  <br>• Delivers to multiple household  <br>• Good for demo nstrations  • Message is temporary – requires multiple exposure  <br>• No reference back to message  <br>• Repetition may irritate the view er <br>• Advertising is expensive  <br>• Viewers may channel -hop or leave during ads  <br>• Advertising “clutter”  <br>• Reaches general audience  <br>Source:  Bowler , Dawood & Page (2007)  <br> <br>Table 12.1  indicates the advantages and disadvantages of television. Televisi on is one of the best advertising <br>mediums because it can combine visual images with sound, motion a nd colour (Du Plessis et al., 2009). No <br>other advertising medium offers more creative flexibility than television. Another advantage i s that television <br>is very popular and reaches a large target audience. Television is able to reach the largest target audi ence with <br>one advertising message. Since television has such an extensive circulation the cost per exposure for each <br>advertising messa ge is relatively low. T elevision allows for a large amount of creative freedom. It offers the <br>use of sight, sound, motion,  colour and demonstrations. Cohen (2008) explains that audience selectivity can <br>be achieved on television in a variety of ways. The ad vertiser can select a s pecific market segment by choosing <br>the day of the week, the time of the day and the programming mat erial.  <br>12.3.5.2 Radio  <br>Radio is one of the few mediums that actually reach the majority of the black population at any one time. <br>Radio is effective as an advertising medium in both urban and rural areas and has a very cost -effective reach. <br>Radio advertising  is very flexible; it offers businesses the best mix of formal advertising, infomercials and <br>sponsorships (Du Plessis et al., 2009). R adio has become an extremely viable media option for companies to 191 <br> advertise, both locally and nationally.  Table 12.2  illustrates the advantages and disadvantages of radio as an <br>advertising medium.  <br>Table 12.2 Advantages and disadvantages of radio  <br>Advantages  Disadvantages  <br>• Cheaper than television advertising  <br>• Cheaper to produce than t elevision  <br>• Easy to reach a specific targe t market  <br>• Can reach people on the move  <br>• Geographically selective  <br>• No literacy necessa ry • Allows for target market selection  <br>• No illustration possible  <br>• Only short messages  <br>• Limited availability  <br>• No reference back to message  <br>• Radio has no visuals  <br>• There is no hard copy  <br>• Radio is a background medium  <br>Source:  Du Plessis, Bothma, Jordaan & Van Heerden (2009: 58 –60) <br> <br>Radio commercials are not too costly to make and the cost of radio time is much lower than that of television. <br>Radio als o allows the marketer to direct the advert at a more specific target market due to the fact that it can <br>be used nationally  or locally. A nother advantage of advertising  on radio is that it is the most large -scale of all <br>advertising media. Most houses have a t least one radio; the average household owns up to six radios (Baines <br>& Page, 2007). Virtually every new car comes standa rd with a radi o; practically every person will listen to the <br>radio at least once in a day. Radio can deliver both high levels of reach  and frequency as well as narrowly <br>targeted market segments. Radio reaches a large audience – approximately 95 per cent of  all adults li sten on <br>a weekly basis.  <br>In comparison to television, radio is a relatively low -cost medium. Compared to other media, rad io has a fairly <br>low cost per thousand listeners (Cohen, 2008). Radio is generally inexpensive in terms of investment costs  as <br>well as co st per thousand. Because of its low cost and the ability radio has to contact specific target markets, <br>radio can often b e used as a supporting medium to round out a media plan. Radio can give a business <br>personality through the creation of adv ertising campa igns that make use of sounds and voices.  <br>12.3.5.3 Print media  <br>Print media such as magazines and newspapers have been in existence as advertising media for more than two <br>centuries (Du Plessis et al., 2009). Even though there has been an increa se in competit ion from broadcast <br>media, newspapers and magazines have remained important to both their readers and advertisers. Newspa pers <br>and magazines are the most predominant type of print media.  <br>Magazines  <br>Magazines have become a more specialised form o f advertising  medium (Du Plessis et al., 2009), and reach <br>specific target audiences in both consumer and business markets. According t o Morris (1992: 93), magazine <br>advertising is very good for long -term brand building. Most black people do not discard maga zines and the  <br>retention value of advertising in these is exceptionally high. The life of magazines is one of the longest of all <br>media,  and passing it on to others increases its life. Magazines can be used to reach a specific target audience. <br>Magazines, the refore, have the ability to reach most consumer interests. In South Africa advertisers rely <br>heavily on print media such as magazines t o reach target audiences.  Table 12.3  refers to the advantages and <br>disadvantag es of magazines as an advertising medium.  <br>Table 12.3 Advantages and disadvantages of magazines  192 <br> Advantages  Disadvantages  <br>• Have a specific target audience  <br>• Offer a wide array of editorial formats  <br>• Have a longer life than newspapers  <br>• Better quality paper than ne wspapers  <br>• Good colour and photo reproduction  <br>• Can reach a large number of people  <br>• High reader involvement  • Expensive  <br>• Not geog raphically selective  <br>• Little flexibility due to long read time  <br>• Do not offer sound/motion  <br>• Long lead times, advertiser has to plan long in  advance  <br>Source:  Anon (2011)  <br> <br>Companies use magazines to advertise because of the audience selectivity they offer. Magazin es are one of <br>the most selective of all media in terms of being able to pick out particular target groups. Magazines allow for <br>better targeting of audience, as a bu siness can choose magazine publications that cater to their specific <br>audience or whose edito rial content specialises in topics of interest to their audience.  <br>The problem magazine advertising has in South Africa is that a large  percentage of the population is still <br>illiterate or semi -illiterate. The biggest drawback of magazine advertising is that  it is expensive. Many small <br>businesses have to place advertisements in numerous different magazines in order to reach their target ma rkets. <br>Because of long printin g time, magazine advertisements must be prepared long in advance. Due to lengthy <br>printing ti me, magazine advertising tends to be inflexible when reacting to changes in the market environment. <br>The deadline for placing an advert  in a magazine is usually one month or more before the publication.  <br>Newspapers  <br>Newspapers are the largest advertising medi um in terms of both advertising revenue and the  number of <br>advertisers. Newspapers are not only an important advertising medium for loc al advertising, but national <br>advertisers also find newspapers to be a valuable advertising medium.  Table 12.4  provides the advantages and <br>disadvantages of newspapers as an advertising medium.  <br>Table 1 2.4 Advantages and disadvantages of newspapers  <br>Advantages  Disadvantages  <br>• Provides illustrations and explanations  <br>• Suitable for high fre quency  <br>• Adaptable to change  <br>• Relatively cheap per reader  <br>• Geographically selective  <br>• Wide array of editorial environments  <br>• Perma nence of the advertising message  <br>• Can reach a lar ge number of people  <br>• Lower advertising production costs  <br>• Higher local -market penetration  than magazines  <br>• Consumers often look for ads in newspapers  • Limits specific audience targeting  <br>• Reproduction of photos  <br>• Not p opular with all age groups  <br>• Do not offer sound/motion  <br>• Newspapers are short lived  <br>• Many advertisers have little chance of dominating  <br>Source: Surmanek (2013)  <br> <br>Newspapers allow for the presentation of detailed information and the information can be processed at  the <br>reader’s own pace. Newspaper advertisements are more effective than television if a large amount of 193 <br> information needs to be taken  in by the customer ( Du Plessis et al., 2009). Newspaper adverts can be read <br>more than once by the consumer, therefore inc reasing the retention of the information the marketer wants <br>them to store. Advertising in newspapers can be used to target a specific audience on both a de mographic and <br>geographic basis.  <br>There are a number of factors that limit the growth of newspapers as an advertising medium. The quality of <br>newspapers’ paper is not of the same standard as that of magazines. Because of this limitation, newspapers do <br>not all ow advertisers the same creative freedom as magazines do. The coarse paper used by newspapers creates  <br>a less impressive effect than that achieved by the smooth paper used in magazines. Newspapers may provide <br>large geographic selectivit y but they do not off er much selectivity in terms of all socioeconomic groups. <br>Newspapers also have a short lifespan; most  newspapers only last a day before being thrown out. Due to this, <br>the opportunity for exposure to the advertising message is limited t o one reading.  <br>Outdoo r media  <br>According to Cohen (2008), “outdoor advertising refers to all advertisements displayed out of  the home with <br>the exception of those appearing on transportation facilities”. There is a variety of very effective forms of <br>outdoor m edia that can be used  in advertising. These include using buses, shopping carrier bags, posters, bin <br>panels, bus -stop shel ters, wall paintings and supermarket trolley panels. Taxis can also be used as a form of <br>outdoor media and are especially useful when wanting to advertise in the townships. Point -of-purchase <br>displays can be placed outside retail outlets in the townships. O ther forms of outdoor media are billboards, <br>rolling boards, mobile advertising boards and aerial advertising (Du Plessis et al., 2009) . A poster provides a  <br>cost-effective advertising medium while outdoor advertising is an advertising medium that continues to grow <br>and has been found to be very successful.  <br>12.4 PUBLIC RELATIONS  <br>Public relations (PR) relates to managing, through the communi cation of perceptions , strategic relationships <br>between a small business and its internal and external stakeholders. Theref ore, the public’s perception of a <br>small business is very important, whether based on fact or fiction. PR personnel should be able to p resent a <br>small busine ss to the world in its best light. In this era of social consciousness, a small business is expected to <br>operate with a high level of ethics, with every regard for the needs, desires and feelings of the community with <br>whom it deals. A s mall business is expe cted to operate in the public interest and to respect and observe good <br>manners and sensitivity. Four major PR models can be identified:  <br>1. Promotion and publicity (one -way communication/hype) of products and services  <br>2. Applied journalism (o ne-way communication/credibility) which is when an article is written about a <br>specific business  <br>3. Research and persuasion (t wo-way communication, win/neutral) which are used to influence the <br>customer to buy a specific product  <br>4. Dialogue, m utual solutions (two -way communication, win/win) which can be used to inform the <br>customer about specific products  <br>Next, internet marketing for the small business will be outlined.  <br>12.5 INTERNET MARKETING AND SOCIAL MEDIA FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS  <br>Internet mar keting or online adve rtising consists of activities using the Web or email to drive direct sales via <br>e-commerce, or creating sales leads from w ebsites or email marketing (Dockel & Ligthelm, 2012). Internet 194 <br> marketing is a diverse area with many tools to bri ng customers to the s mall business’s products and services. <br>The use of internet marketing in South Africa is increasing and plays an important role in development. <br>According to Herath and Mahmood (2013), the internet has many potential applications, includ ing “e -mail, <br>games, s hopping, banking and real time news”. In South Africa, the challenge is that access to the internet is <br>still limited for m ost rural populations. According to Kshetri (2011), the distribution of telephony services in <br>South Africa contin ues to reflect the hi ghly uneven development of the infrastructure of the past, with 18 per <br>cent of black households and 82 per cent of white h ouseholds having telephony service. The generalist nature <br>of managers’ and employees’ skills within small busines ses result in limited  knowledge about how various <br>computer technologies could contribute to an overall emarketing strategy.  <br>12.5.1 Internet mar keting and social -media tools  <br>Internet marketing is when a small business only uses the internet to market the bu siness. Internet mark eting <br>is a diverse area with many tools such as social media to bring customers to the small business’s products and <br>servi ces. Internet marketing consists of online advertisements to drive traffic to an advertiser’s website. These <br>include banner advertisem ents, pay -per-click (PPC) and targeted email lists. Social media is an internet <br>marketing tool that facilitates social net working by means of media including blogs, podcasts, message boards, <br>video blogging, wikis and Twitter.  <br>Social me dia is a function of internet marketing, which can promote a small business. Internet usage is the <br>measurement (expressed in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes) of the amount of data flowing through <br>the computer of a small business and the internet n etwork for a defined period. These data are transferred in <br>both directions: from the internet network to the computer (download), and from the computer to the internet <br>network (upload). Whether surfing the Web, sending emails, playing online games, downloa ding various <br>items, o r using network gaming consoles, any activity on the internet generates usage. Internet marketing <br>usage is the measurement  of the amount of data used to promote an SME. Social media is the collective of <br>online communications channels d edicated to community -based input, interaction, content sharing and <br>collaboration. Websites and applications dedicated to forums, microblogging , social networking, social <br>bookmarking, social duration and wikis are among the different types of social media.  Social media usage i s <br>the use of these tools to promote the marketing of a small business. The main tools for internet marketing and <br>social me dia are the following:  <br>1. Search engine marketing (Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc.)  <br>2. Directories and listings  <br>3. Email marketi ng <br>4. Social -media marke ting <br>5. Public relations  <br>6. Online advertising  <br>Think of the internet as a tree; the internetmarketing tools are the branches. Th e main part of the tree is made <br>of a website where customers come to read and be converted to a sale. The followi ng are important:  <br>• Development:  the approach and technology here is crucial to ensure all internet users are reachable and <br>servable.  <br>• Design:  ensuring the customers’ experience of the small business’s processes and branding is user -friendly is <br>crucial to conveying the marketing message, which facilitates the conversion of a lead to a sale.  <br>The roots of the tree show the methodologies and practic es that ensure any internet -marketing approach is <br>successful and are as follows:  <br>• Conducting research to understand the target market and the marketing message to enable a conversion <br>from leads to sales, as well as on the competition’s approach and its infl uence on the strategy  <br>• Strategising to attract the target market that will buy the product or service  <br>• Communication strategies to engage a nd convert potential leads to a sale  <br>• Branding of the products and the medium used to reach the target market  <br>• Relevant, value-added driven information, not just to win over customer or clients’ trust, but also to inform <br>them about the product  195 <br> Small business es use social -media platforms to power their success. Social media is becoming an integral part <br>of life online, as obse rved by Witzig, Spencer & Galvin (2012). They use social media to market products, <br>promote brands, connect to current customers and reach  new business. Examples of social media are discussed <br>next.  <br>• According to statistics gathered by the Nielsen Group (201 5), internet users within the US spend more time <br>on Facebook than any other website. Facebook is a popular free social networking website that allows <br>registered users to create profiles, keep in touch with friends, family and colleagues, and post pictures,  <br>videos and messages to them.  <br>• Twitter is a microblogging service that allows registered members to freely broadcast short posts. These <br>short informational posts are called tweets. Twitter members can follow other users’ tweets by using <br>multiple platforms a nd d evices.  <br>• Google’s social networking project, Google+ (pronounced Google plus), is designed to replicate interaction <br>people demonstrate offline more closely than is the case in other mainstream social networking services.  <br>• Wikipedia is an open -content, on line encyclopaedia created through the collaborative effort of a community <br>of users known as Wikipedians. It is free to the public. Any re gistered individual on the site can create an <br>article for publication. Registration is not required to edit articles, but any editorials made are reviewed <br>before publishing. Wikipedia was founded in January 2001 and is a non -profit organisation dependent o n <br>donations from the public.  <br>• The social networking site designed specifically for the business community is LinkedIn. This site allows <br>registered members across the globe to establish and document networks of people they trust <br>professionally. The site also  allows members to set up groups to discuss professional work -related issues <br>or approaches.  <br>• Reddit is a social news we bsite and forum where news items are socially circulated and promoted by site <br>members. The site is composed of hundreds of subcommunities,  each with a specific topic such as <br>technology, politics or music. Reddit site members can submit content, which is th en v oted upon by other <br>members with the goal to send well -regarded news stories to the top of the site’s main page.  <br>• Pinterest is a social website where registered members can add, share and categorise images. It is mainly a <br>visual discovery tool that enabl es users to find images regarding their interests. Each visual is <br>accompanied by a brief description, and clicking on an image will take m embers to the original source of <br>information.  <br>Mutula and Mostert (2011) indicate that both domestic and global marketi ng sales depend on the targeting of <br>specific groups, which usually involves the use of internet search engines and display companies provi ding <br>advertising and routing to the small business’s sales page or contact details. Tan and Teo (2010) observe that <br>although most small business have access to the internet, they still seem to experience challenges in using it. <br>There are five main issues t hat previous studies (UN, 2012) noticed with traditional internet advertising using <br>search engine and display networks : <br>1. The cost and the difficulty in targeting specific groups according to the business’s funnel.  <br>2. Understanding and applying keyword search m ethodology and search engine optimisation (SEO) – most <br>small businesses do not have the knowledge or the time to gain the knowledge to apply keyword and <br>SEO successfully.  <br>3. Most sites set up by small businesses do not provide adequate customer or consumer ex perience to <br>ensure high conversion.  <br>4. Most small -business owners do not understand how to approach internet marketing an d internet <br>customer interaction technologies.  <br>5. Even small businesses that have budgets to outsource the building of a website do not usuall y get the <br>service and technology to enable them to fully service both the desktop, tablet and mobile market.  <br>Social -media tools facilitate social networking by means of media such as blogs, podcasts, message boards, <br>video blogging, wikis and Twitter (Witzi g et al., 2012: 113). Social networking is a meeting of mostly like -<br>minded individuals on a social media site  to discuss a  matter of interest amongst the group (Lacho & <br>Marinello, 2010: 128). The business community took note of the customisation of individ ual pages by <br>adopting and incorporating the customisation into their own social networking pages where an org anisation is <br>able to share information, pictures, videos and advertising (Lacho & Marinello, 2010: 128). By customising <br>social media pages, thereby  attracting customers and engaging with them, customer loyalty can be fostered. It 196 <br> should be noted that socia l media is al so a means of fostering and preserving customer loyalty, and improving <br>the engagement and contact between the customer and the busines s. According to Witzig et al. (2012: 114), <br>this increases loyalty with customers and ensures that a long -term relationship  is built and conserved. <br>Additionally, social media can serve a number of functions within the business community well. Functions of <br>social media include the following (Lacho & Marinello, 2010: 129; Witzig et al., 2012: 114):  <br>• Managing informat ion that is p ublicly available about your professional profile  <br>• Locating and becoming acquainted with potential customers, service providers and rec ommended experts in <br>your field  <br>• Creating and collaborating on organisational projects, gathering data, sharing  files and pr oviding solutions  <br>• Being visible and indicating availability of potential business opportunities and partnerships  <br>• Gaining valuable insi ghts into an area of interest with like -minded professionals  <br>• Making beneficial connections that may enable bu siness deals  <br>• Advertising job opportunities to find excellent human capital for the organisation  <br>12.5.2 Is internet -marketing usage crucial for smal l businesses?  <br>Internet marketing refers to a set of powerful tools and methodologies used for promoting prod ucts and <br>servi ces through the internet. Internet marketing is ideal for small businesses, as they, more so than larger <br>organisations, focus on drawi ng the attention of customers. In other parts of the world, the small business has <br>been slower to adopt soci al media as a marketing tool (Bakeman & Hanson, 2012: 106). Theunissen (2012) <br>suggests that organisations should implement a basic yet effective soc ial media and internet -marketing <br>strategy involving Facebook, Twitter, a blog and an updated and user -friend ly website. Th e social -media <br>strategy variables can be used to create brand awareness, promote offers, provide information and provide <br>interaction o pportunities with consumers and a means to engage with customers.  <br>However, designing and implementing an att ractive websit e does not guarantee individuals will visit it; regular <br>updates, value -added content and marketing of the website online are important  elements to draw potential <br>clients to a small business’s website. Theunissen (2012) mentioned that: “The vi tal part of an y Internet -<br>marketing activity for small business is that it enables entrepreneurs to have one -on-one discussions with <br>people who activ ely express an interest in their companies. As such, if they’re managed properly, they can act <br>as a ‘call ce ntre’ for thei r operations.” However, the questions remains as to what challenges exist when <br>adopting internet marketing in a small business.  <br>Marx a nd Van der Walt (2003) indicate that small businesses can use the internet for marketing products and <br>servic es by providin g online quotes, advertising in more markets with less marketing expense, and using email <br>as a marketing tool to enlarge their reach t o potential target markets. This approach decreases the costs of <br>printing materials such as catalogues and g lossy brochure s, as well as the expenses related to delivery <br>mechanisms such as postal services or courier services. Marx and Van der Walt (2003) ha ve identified <br>motivation drivers such as the opportunity to promote their company better; lower operating an d marketing <br>costs; enrich their overall marketing communications mix and sales funnel effectiveness; and increase sales <br>and profits. A recent study conducted by World Wide Worx (2012) in Britain shows that 79 per cent of the <br>SME respondents felt it was cri tical to their  marketing to have a website to represent their brand and showcase <br>their products or services. The same study also highlighted the fol lowing:  <br>• Small -business owners are familiar with social -media marketing, email marketing and SEO.  <br>• Over 50 per  cent manage t heir digital activities in -house and one -third have some sort of agency support.  <br>• The least familiar online marketing tactics are conte nt marketing, affiliate marketing and inbound marketing.  <br>Summarising the research study findings, Friedlein (2014: 21), fo under and managing director at Browser <br>Media, remarked:  <br>It’s heartening to find that small businesses understand that their website ca n be a valuable business asset but <br>equally concerning that only half invest in promoting it more broadly. It ’s a bit like setting up a new retail <br>outlet and then only telling family and friends how to find you. In order to attract new customers and grow <br>their businesses, these small businesses need to think like a big brand and make more noise online.  197 <br> South Afri ca has one of the largest internet economies in Africa. A report by Goldstuck (2012) shows that <br>South Africa had approximately 8.5 million active in ternet users at the end of 2011. This represented a 25 per <br>cent increase over the 6.8 million recorded in 20 10. This high growth rate is the result of the proliferation of <br>smartphones in the South African market – making internet available to more people w ithout ADSL or another <br>physical connection. South African internet penetration grew to approximately 17 per cent, but it i s by no <br>means the biggest percentage of internet penetration in the African continent: Nigeria, with its 45 million <br>users, has a 29 pe r cent penetration. Egypt has a user base of 21.6 million users with a 26 per cent penetration, <br>while Morocc o’s 15.6 milli on users represent a 49 per cent penetration. Kenya has an estimated 10.4 million <br>internet users with a 25 per cent penetration.  <br>12.5. 3 Small -business challenges adopting internet marketing and social media  <br>The small business does not have the same resourc es as large organisations to promote the use of internet <br>marketing. Larger organisations have human capital and financial means t o cre ate and implement a social -<br>media strategy to enable internet marketing (Bakeman & Hanson, 2012: 107). Internet marketing h as taken <br>advertising to a whole new level by using social -media activities. In a study carried out by (Bakeman & <br>Hanson, 2012) on  the barriers affecting the implementation of internet systems and procedures in different <br>countries, it was revealed that the high cost of installing infrastructure; the high price of technology, large <br>investment requirements and liquidity constraints for m the  largest barrier. Other concerns are: uncertain <br>returns on investment (ROI); limited worker expertise caused by a general shortage of highly skilled workers <br>and insufficient training; lack of management vision, support and enthusiasm in the adoption o f internet <br>technology; an inability to outsource IT expertise; and bad experiences in the past. Therefore, despite the <br>affordab ility of social -media networks, the time factor, lack of skills and the learning factor, which requires a <br>time investment to lear n and  manage the social -media page, internet marketing may still be out of the small <br>business’s reach. However, small -business owners do understand the value of internet marketing in enhancing <br>productivity and competitiveness (Bakeman & Hanson,  2012: 107).  Previous studies (Dlodlo & Dhurup, <br>2010) confirm that small businesses perceive the following as challenges to using social an d internet <br>marketing:  <br>• Start -up investment costs for the internet, which are high due to the necessary tools and expertise require d <br>• Inadequate access to technologies, ineffective selling techniques and limited market research  <br>• Security of information  <br>• Unautho rised access to sensitive or proprietary information, and limited verification of authorship of <br>messages  <br>• Lack of management suppo rt an d encouragement  <br>• Resistance to change  <br>• Lack of resources  <br>Perhaps the most important statistic to come out of the small -busin ess survey (World Wide Worx, 2012) is <br>that 63 per cent of formal small businesses in South Africa have a website, which leaves mo re than a third of <br>small businesses without an online global presence.  <br>12.6 CONCLUSION  <br>In this chapter, stakeholder communicati on and building relationships for small business were described. In <br>addition, the role of marketing communication in stakeholder commu nications, the elements of small -business <br>marketing communication and lastly, internet marketing and social media for the small business were reflected <br>on. 198 <br> REVIEW QUESTIONS  <br>12.1 Define the stakeholders of the South African small business with practica l exa mples.  <br>12.2 Illustrate the different groups of stakeholders of a small business.

Her enthusiasm was so <br>sharp it was infectious. Not for long though. Her father was the owner of the newly built Modiselle small shopping centre. He <br>also owned the shop that sold and repaired cell phone s in the shopping centre. Lerato was going to manage the whole <br>shopping centre, but she thought she should visit one store first. In j ust two hours of observation, she saw five customers <br>complaining of poor service, especially after -sales service. Repairs were not done timeously or satisfactorily, according to one <br>of the customers. Lerato could also see that the shop was understaffed, so  the two employees who were there, Matome and <br>Mmakoma, were hardly coping and looked exhausted before half of the day was gone. They also did  everything from sales to <br>repairs.  What exactly did they specialise in? Lerato learned from Matome, the longest -serving employee, that in the past six <br>months two employees had resigned, complaining of being overworked. “What is going on here?” Lerato asked herself.  <br>Lerato went back to her father, Mr Modiselle himself, because the cell -phone shop was his, to discuss her  observations. She <br>had to think about what to do for the little cell -phone shop as well as the overall shopping centre.  <br>Unfortunately Modiselle shopping centre’s situation is not unique. Small businesses are particularly plagued <br>by challenges of having to work with employees who do not necessarily have the requisite knowledge and <br>expertise, and at times the managers/owners ar e not even aware of labour legislation. Hence there i s a need to 203 <br> pay specific focus to human resources management (HRM) for the surviv al and sustainability of all <br>organisations in the face of competition.  <br>13.1.1 What is human resources management?  <br>Small bu sinesses play a very significant role in the economic development of any country, including those in <br>emerging economies. Emerging econ omies are characterised by growing market orientation as well as <br>growing economic activities. One of the essential  keys to  this increase in economic activity is entrepreneurship <br>and small -business management. Small businesses contribute to economic growth through the creation of <br>employment opportunities as well as their innovation. Like all sizes of businesses, small business es exist in <br>order to be productive and have a sustained competitive advantage over time (Kongolo, 2010). To be <br>sustainable, organisati ons depend on robust human resources (HR) and capabilities that should also not be <br>easy to duplicate or replace. T hese res ources include capable human capital that can craft organisational <br>strategies that will help organisations to survive and be sustainab le (Ismail, Rose, Uli & Abdullah, 2012).  <br>Hiring and retaining talented and capable human resources is a major chal lenge fo r organisations. This is why <br>managing human resources has to be done effectively and diligently. Gone are the days when the human <br>resources department used to be called the personnel department, dealing basically with administrative issues. <br>Accordi ng to Da ft and Benson (2016), nowadays HR assumes a more strategic role in the organisation, to help <br>the organisation to  <br>• become more competiti ve in the global business environment  <br>• improve quality, innovation and customer service  <br>• understand and apply new in formatio n and communication technologies.  <br>There are many definitions of “human resources management (HRM)”. Basically HRM encompasses <br>everythi ng organisations do to get the best from their most valuable resource, their employees. Daft and <br>Benson (2016: 446 ) define  HRM as “the design and application of formal systems in an organization to ensure <br>the effective and efficient use of human talent to accomplish organizational goals”. The systems that are <br>designed are specifically to attract a talented and capable  workfor ce, place them in the correct positions within <br>the organisation, maintain and develop them, and retain them.  <br>13.1.2 The phases of huma n resources management  <br>Managing human resources involves three main phases:  <br>1. Firstly there is the initial phase  attracting and procuring  employees, which encompasses planning, i.e. <br>aligning human resources goals with those of the overall organisation and th en conducting a job <br>analysis. This determines the kinds of business/job activities required by the organisation to  be <br>prod uctive and sustainable as well as who will perform those activities, that is, the skills  required to <br>achieve organisational goals. Onc e the required skills have been determined through job analysis, the <br>organisation can then engage in the recruitme nt and s election of the most appropriately qualified <br>candidate for the organisation. The selected candidate is then offered a position in the organisation and <br>then appointed, should that person accept the offer.  <br>2. Secondly, upon the candidate’s appointment, the seco nd phase of human resources management, <br>the maintenance phase , commences. This involves staffing and induction, which is conducted to <br>familiarise the selected incumbent with the way the organisation is structured, including: reporting roles <br>and res ponsibil ities; the way the organisation operates; remuneration/compensation; and the employee <br>benefits (discussed in detail under  section 13.3.4  of this chapter). Together with remuneration and <br>benefits to keep/retain employees , it is important to train and develop employees, manage their health <br>and safety and carry out appraisal and perfo rmance m anagement.  <br>3. The last phase is that of  termination  of employment, which can either be voluntary on the part of the <br>employee or involunta ry. Voluntary termination includes resigning or quitting while involuntary <br>termination incorporates processes like  dismiss al, right -sizing, downsizing or retirement. Dismissal can <br>be due to (i) employment or work -related challenges like poor performance or  the negative attitude of <br>an employee or (ii) more serious offences like theft, fraud, insubordination and/or othe r offenc es that 204 <br> can also be of a criminal nature.  Figure 13.1  represents the three  phases of human resources <br>management.  <br>Figure 13.1  indicates that labour relations  run thr oughout the human resources management process. This <br>indicates that managers of all businesses, small and big, should always keep in m ind the rules and regulations <br>that govern the relationship between employees, employers and organisations in order  to avoi d expensive and <br>unnecessary legal actions that can be brought against their organisations.  <br>Figure 13.1 The Human resources management functions  <br> <br>13.2 ATTRACTING HUMAN RESOURCES AND STAFFING ORGANISATIONS  <br>13.2.1 Strategic human resources planning  <br>In every  organisation, the human resources function is part of the overall organisational structure with its <br>mission, vision and objectives. A s a result, the human resources strategy should be linked with the gener al <br>strategy of the overall organisation. Strategic  human resources management, if done well, can help the <br>organisation in achieving its objectives and in gaining and maintaining a comp etitive advantage. Following <br>and/or linked to the overall organisational  vision, mission and objectives, HR will embark on  its own analysis <br>and crafting of objectives. The duties that need to be accomplished in order to achieve the set organisational <br>objec tives, the kind of employees’ skills, knowledge, abilities and competenc ies that are available to perform <br>those duties; an d eventually the skills, knowledge, abilities and competencies that are still required by the <br>organisation will then be assessed. The gap between what is available and what is required will help managers <br>decide whether there is a need to recruit other empl oyees or not.  <br>The definition of strategic HR planning by Warnich, Carrell, Elbert and Hatfield (2015: 119) gives a <br>comprehensive defin ition of the whole process as follows: “The process by which company goa ls, as put forth <br>in the mission statement and comp any plans are translated into HR objectives to ensure that the company is <br>205 <br> neither over - nor understaffed, that employees with the appr opriate talents, skills and desire are available to <br>carry out their task s in the right jobs at the right times”. The human  resources planning process is outlined <br>in Figure 13.2 . <br> <br>Figure 13.2 Human resourc es planning  <br> <br> <br>13.2.2 Job analysis and design  <br>Job analysis involves reviewing a job in terms of the type of duties and tasks required for that job, the resources <br>that will be needed, as well as the amount of time it will take to accomplish that job. It is defined as “a <br>systematic way to gather and ana lyse information about the content, context and the human requirements of <br>jobs” (Warnich  et al., 2015: 162). The process of conducting a job analysis requires, firstly, a review of the <br>organisational objectives  to determine the type of tasks required to ef fectively accomplish those objectives. <br>This means collecting information about the job t hat will be performed by employees in a certain position. <br>That type of job information can be collected through the use of  questionnaires or holding interviews with <br>several sources. These include employees who are currently holding those positions or simil ar positions, the <br>supervisors of those employees or the professional job analysts. Collection of data can also be through <br>observations of job incumbents and/or scrutini sing records about what those positions entail. It is possible that <br>some positions may n ot be available in small businesses as they may perhaps be in the process of being created. <br>In that case, the organisation  can benchmark with similar positions in other  organisations.  <br>The process of job analysis is presented in  Figure 13.3  below.  <br> <br> <br>206 <br> Figure 13.3 The job analysis process  <br> <br>Information that is collected through the jo b-analysis process is subsequently utilised to design the jobs that <br>were assessed in a process of job design.  <br>13.2.3 Recru itment  <br>The information from job analysis can then be u tilised to attract prospective employees through the process <br>of recruitment , also known as  talent acquisition  to put emphasis on the fact that an organisation looks for <br>people who have certain targeted competencies to achieve predetermined organisational g oals. Recruitment <br>can be defined in different ways that can include “activities or practices that define the characteristics of <br>applicant to whom selection procedures are ultimately applied” (Daft & Ben son, 2014). Recruitment considers <br>information about av ailable skills, identified in the planning phase, and where the non -available sk ills can be <br>acquired.  <br>Recruitment can be done either internally or externally.  Internal recruitment sources/media  for <br>dissemination of information about the required candidates /employees include the intranet, notice boards and <br>so forth. In most cases, inte rnal recruitment will result in promotion of employees. External recruitment, on <br>the other hand, will end up bringing new talent and different thinking from outside the organis ation.  External <br>recruitment sources  that can be utilised include, for instance, newspapers, the internet (e -recruiting), <br>employment agencies, professional organisations, educational institutions, referr als by employees and walk -<br>ins (Warnich et al., 2015; N el et al., 2014).  Figure 13.4  illustrates a comparison between internal and extern al <br>recruitment.  <br> <br> <br> <br>207 <br> Figure 13.4 Internal vs. external recruitment  <br> <br>It is crucia l to remember that whatever source of recruitment is employed, it should not discriminate against <br>any member of society wh o could be eligible to apply for the advertised position. The following prescripts <br>should be taken into consideration:  <br>• The Constitutio n of the Republic of South Africa  (as amended), through its Bill of Rights, prohibits any unfair <br>discrimination against an y person based on their race, gender, age, sexual orientation, ethnic or social <br>origin, religion.  <br>• The Labour Relations Act  (LRA) 66 of  1995  (as amended) also prohibits discrimination. The act specifically <br>states that from the time an organisation advertise s a position, it should not unfairly discriminate against <br>candidates based on their gender or race unless they are trying to attract c andidates from designated <br>groups as part of their equity targets.  <br>• Employment equity is guided by the Affirmative Action (A A) programme in terms of Chapter 3 of <br>the Employment Equity Act  (EEA)  55 of 1998 . In addition, the EEA also specifically s tates that “ No person <br>may unfairly discriminate, directly or indirectly, against an employee, in any employment policy or <br>practice, on  one or more grounds, including race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, family <br>responsibility, ethnic or social orig in, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, HIV status, <br>conscience, belief, political opinion, culture, language and bi rth”.  <br>• The Basic Conditions of Employment Act  (BCEA)  75 of 1997  (as well as the  BCEA Amendment Act 20 of <br>2013 ) was promulga ted mainly t o promote fair labour practice in the workplace, in line with section 23(1) <br>of the Constitution. The Act gives minimum pre scripts/guidelines, to both the employer and employee, in <br>terms of the number of working hours; leave, type of leave and t he minimum n umber of days that can be <br>taken for each type of leave; particulars of minimum remuneration/compensation; conditions under  <br>which employment can be terminated by either the employer or employee; non -employment of children; <br>as well as guidance in  terms of vi olation of any of the outlined minimum prescripts.  <br>However employers who are aiming to achieve their employment equity tar gets or are choosing a person based <br>on job -inherent characteristics are not considered to be discriminatory.  <br>The above pre scripts of n on-discrimination against any candidate apply to any organisation, big or small, and <br>apply all the more so during the sele ction phase.  <br>During recruitment the employing organisation should specify the following:  <br>• The type of application forms tha t should be submitted when applying for the advertised position  <br>• Any other required attachments, like a curriculum vitae (CV), certific ates of qualifications, referee reports <br>and a copy of the identity document (ID)  <br>• The date by which all applications should  be sent for  consideration by the advertising organisation.  <br>When applicants have sent in their applications, the selection process wil l ensue.  <br>208 <br> 13.2.4 Selection  <br>Selection, “the process of choosing the most qualified applicant recruited for a job” (Lussier, 2009: 238), <br>follows after applicants have sent in their applications and there is a pool of applicants from which the most <br>appropriate  candidate for the advertised position can be chosen. Selection occurs in several steps as follows:  <br>13.2.4.1 Step 1: Initi al screening  <br>The first step is to conduct the initial screening of candidates by scanning through the application forms to <br>eliminate c andidates who obviously do not qualify for the position due to several possible reasons that may <br>include:  <br>• Not having the requisite ski lls (i.e. minimum requirements) for the position  <br>• Not having completed the application forms fully or correctly  <br>• Not having included all the requested information/documents.  <br>Some candidates may be contacted telephonically or by email for them to verify and/o r send more information.  <br>13.2.4.2 Step 2: Pre -employment testing  <br>Testing should be job inherent (e.g. number of words type d per minute when looking for a typist) and should <br>not in any way be construed as discriminatory. It should be noted that testing is a  highly contentious issue and <br>should be conducted with caution and consideration of labour legislation. Chapter 2 (section  8) of the EEA <br>specifically mentions psychometric testing. It explicitly states that: “Psychometric testing and other similar <br>assessme nts of an employee are prohibited unless the test or assessment being used - <br>a)  has been scientifically shown to be valid and reliable;  <br>b)  can be applied fairly to employees; and  <br>c)  is not biased against any employee or group”.  <br>So it is probably a good i dea, should it be essential to conduct psychometric testing, to make use of <br>appropriately qualified professionals who are able to comply with the stipulations as well as rules and <br>regulations of psychometric testing, as outlined by the Professional Board f or Psychologists.  <br>Following determination of the appropriateness of testing, those candidates who make it through the init ial <br>screening may then be invited for pre -employment testing. Testing is dependent on the nature and level of the <br>job. In the case of positions at managerial level, assessment centres may be employed to carry out a process <br>of evaluation of candidates. This  process is usually carried out away from the premises where employment <br>will take place, by trained professionals who use various asse ssment tools such as simulation exercises, case <br>studies, observation and role plays to evaluate the candidates. This proce ss is costly and as a result may prove <br>to be too difficult, especially for small businesses.  <br>13.2.4.3 Step 3: Interviews  <br>The next step  after testing will be interviews that can be held in one or a combination of several ways:  <br>• Individual interview of a cand idate by one interviewer  <br>• Individual interview of a candidate by a panel (group) of interviewers  <br>• Group interviews of several candidates  (usually better if conducted by a panel for better observation and <br>recording of all information: verbal and non -verbal)  <br>As interviews tend to be cumbersome for both the interviewer(s) and interviewee(s) as well as highly <br>subjective, it is suggested that s ome structuring should take place to decrease the bias. Accordingly, it may be <br>prudent to follow the suggestions below:  209 <br> • Contacting candidates:  candidates should be conducted (by letter, phone, email) in order to give them the <br>date, time and venue of the in terview. A contact name (person) and their contact details should also be <br>given in case there are any questions on the par t of the candidate.  <br>• Review of information:  information about candidates, i.e. their application form and CV (where applicable), <br>the jo b specification and job description as well as the advertisement of the position candidates are being <br>interviewed for shou ld ideally be available to all interviewers. It is also suggested that this information <br>should be made available in advance so that th e interviewers can familiarise themselves with it <br>beforehand.  <br>• Structuring the interview format:  if a panel interview forma t is followed, one of the interviewers should be <br>designated as the chairperson of the team and, if necessary, another one should be th e time -keeper. <br>Ideally, to standardise the kind of questions asked of each interviewee, question s should be prepared in <br>advance. In the case of a panel interview, the panel should also determine who will ask which questions. <br>The interviewers should be care ful not to ask questions that are not job -related or illegal. The system of <br>scoring and recordin g information that transpi res during the interview process should also be established <br>in advance.  <br>• Preparation of the interview setting:  a convenient venue that is conducive to conducting interviews should <br>be prepared and reserved for the interviews. The se tting should also make the  interviewees feel at ease. <br>Adequate time should be allowed for each interview, including time to deliberate upon the interview <br>inform ation and usher in the next interviewee.  <br>• Set an agenda:  an interview is a meeting, and like all meetings, a clear agenda i s required. It is important to <br>start any interview session by outlining what will happen during the interview, and by introducing the <br>interviewer(s) to the candidate.  <br>• After the interview:  candidates should be given an opportunity to ask questions should th ey want/need to. <br>They should then be informed about the approximate amount of time it will take to give them feedback, <br>the channel of communication that will be used to give them feedback and who they can contact should <br>they want to find out about the outc ome of the interview. Finally, it is courteous to thank them for taking <br>the time to come for the interview.  <br>13.2.4.4 Step 4: Backgroun d and referee information check  <br>Checking the background of the prospective candidates is crucia l particularly to verify th eir qualifications. It <br>is also necessary to check with their previous employers and colleagues  <br>• previous issues that involve discipline  <br>• the type of people the applicants are as individuals, employees and co -workers and/or team pla yers <br>• their behaviour and at titude towards themselves, their fellow employees and supervisors and to the work <br>itself.  <br>Interviewers should, however, be careful not  to use reference checks as the sole basis upon which to ground <br>their hiring decisions as there  can be bias and questionab le validity in terms of who gives information about <br>the applicant and especially their relationship with the applicant.  <br>13.2.4.5 Step 5: Medical examinations  <br>Depending on the type of job, it may be necessary to do medical examina tions. Chapter 2 (section 7 ) of the <br>EEA specifically states that  <br>1. “Medical testing of an employee is prohibited, unless - <br>a)  legislation permits or requires the t esting; or  <br>b)  it is justifiable in the light of medical facts, employment conditions, social p olicy, the fair distributio n of <br>employee benefits or the inherent requirements of a job.  <br>2. Testing of an employee to determine that employee’s HIV status is prohib ited unless such testing is <br>determined justifiable by the Labour Court in terms of section 50 ( 4) of this Act”.  <br>The EEA do es not apply to members of the  210 <br> • “National Defence Force;  <br>• National Intelligence Agency; and  <br>• South African Secret Service”.  <br>13.2.4.6 Step  6: Job offer  <br>If a candidate goes through all the stages successfully, i.e. fulfilling all the requirements, then  they may  be <br>recommended for employment. This will be followed by a job offer. The job offered should ideally be in <br>writing and should clearly outline the fo llowing:  <br>• Job title, rank and where the position is located  <br>• To whom the candidate will report, and who will b e reporting to the candidate  <br>• When employment will start  <br>• The nature of the job, as detailed in the job description, for instance  <br>– comp ensation and b enefits offered by the organisation  <br>– whether employment is permanent or on contract (period of contract als o to be specified), part -time or full -<br>time <br>– hours of work and leave  <br>– termination of employment (under what circumstances can the emp loyer or emplo yee terminate their <br>contract).  <br>If the candidate and the employer agree on the terms spelled out in the job o ffer, they can then enter into an <br>employment contract that will be binding to both parties. The above information is also important to  be <br>included i n the  employment contract.  Chapter 4, section 29 (on written particulars of employment) of the <br>Basic Conditi ons of Employment Act (BCEA) 75 of 1997 states that upon employment of a candidate, the <br>candidate should be given an employment contra ct with detail ed information that includes: compensation; <br>number of working hours to be worked and leave. An employment co ntract should be worded in such a way <br>that the employee understands it and it must be signed by both the employer and employee.  Figure <br>13.5 outlines the selection process.  <br>Figure 13.5 The recruitment and selection pr ocess  <br> <br>211 <br> 13.3 M AINTAINING EMPLOYEES  <br>13.3.1 Onboarding and orientation  <br>Onboarding and orientation are two interlinked proce sses that are crucial for the successful integration of <br>employees into the organisation, the organisational culture and acquainting em ployees with all the details of <br>their job for them to be effective and  productive members of the organisation. Onboarding is “a process that <br>starts before the employee joins the organisation, continuing for several months and which aims to develop <br>employee  behaviours that will ensure long -term success and commitment of the e mployee to the <br>organisation”; while orientation refe rs to “the process of integrating the new employee into the organisation <br>and acquainting them with the details and requirements of the  job” (Warnich et al., 2015: 233). For effective <br>onboarding and orient ation the following factors should be considered:  <br>Welcome pack:  upon acceptance of a job offer, the employer should send a welcome pack to the candidate. <br>This pack should give details ab out the first day of work, i.e. the date and time on which the candida te will <br>commence duties, who to report to, the offic e number and what to bring with him or her. The detailed <br>employment contract should also be presented to candidates before they commen ce with their duties.  <br>Who should perform the orientation:  numerous peo ple have different roles and responsibilities in the  <br>orientation process. Some of the information may overlap but may be necessary to help incumbents to be <br>effective and for them to get settled in the organisation.  <br>13.3.2 Performance management and apprais al <br>The purpose of any organisation, profit making or  non-profit making, is to have sustainable productivity. <br>Sustainable productivity is even more crucial for small organisations that ar e trying to survive in the face of <br>global competition. It can be achie ved through competent human resources whose performa nce is appraised <br>and managed well. Through effective performance management, organisations can ensure achievement of <br>their overall goa ls. Nel et al. (2014: 219) define performance management as “a process  of creating a work <br>environment or setting in which people are enabled to perform to the best of their abilities for the achievement <br>of shared goals”.  <br>Performance management helps the or ganisation in making decisions about internal staffing, that is, placi ng <br>the right people with the right qualifications an d competencies in the right positions, succession planning and <br>promotion; seeing what resources are available and which ones are neede d. The two main purposes of <br>performance management are development of employees and remuneration. To a certain extent, emp loyers <br>and employees tend to overemphasise the remunerative aspect of performance management and by so doing <br>disadvantage employee dev elopment for enhanced production.  <br>Performance management has to start by identifying the people who will appraise, usually  <br>managers/supervisors, as well as those who  will be evaluated. All people, appraisers and those who will be <br>evaluated, should be prope rly trained on the appraisal instrument that the organisation chooses to use. Then <br>managers and subordinates should jointl y set clear goals of performance, which are aligned to the overall <br>organisational objectives, and have a common understanding of stand ards of performance. The goals should <br>be SMART, i.e. specific, measura ble, achievable/action oriented, realistic/results o riented and timely/time <br>bound. A plan of performance should then be developed based on these identified goals. This plan of action <br>should be known and understood by all involved personnel.  <br>Then there shou ld be a periodic review of performance, i.e. apprais al against the set standards. The periodic <br>review should ideally involve formal meetings where there are discussions between the appra iser and the <br>employee. Performance appraisal should be followed by fee dback. Any deviation from the standards should <br>be ca refully analysed and measures be put into place to improve future performance. Measures that can be put <br>into place may include: traini ng and development; coaching and mentoring; purchasing or updating equ ipment 212 <br> and/or infrastructure. Performance evaluation  can also inform HR decisions. Annual performance evaluations <br>should be followed by the identification of new goals and replanning. Th e performance management cycle is <br>presented in  Figure 13.6 . <br>Figure 13.6 The perfor mance management cycle  <br> <br>Performance management challenges for any org anisation include the following:  <br>• Managers and employ ees not trained on performance appraisal  <br>• Performance management not well -aligned with overall organisational goals, or not properly al igned with <br>resources (human, infrastructural, financial, technological ) <br>• Little or no feedback provided after each appraisa l session  <br>• Little or no training and/or development offered to employees after performance appraisal  <br>• Performance reviews reactive versu s proactive  <br>• Appraisal is often manual, therefore cumbersome and time consuming  <br>• Rewards that are based on performance revie ws often causing misunderstandings and in -fights  <br>213 <br> 13.3.3 Training and development  <br>HR planning, where there is an analysis of the type o f skills tha t are available in the organisation versus those <br>that are not available, as well as information from performan ce management, can help the organisation in <br>deciding whether or not it needs to train and/or develop its employees. Nel et al. (2014: 194) state t hat <br>“development is the formal education, job experiences, relationships, and assessment of personality and <br>abilities that help employees prepare for the future”. Development is directed at managers or employees who <br>aspire to be managers. On th e other hand , “training is primarily directed at improving an employee’s job <br>performance in the short run, according to a specific job standard. The job standard can be drawn from the job <br>description. Should the decision be to train, then proper analysis o f who should  receive what kind of training <br>should be carried out. This should guide the training objectives that ought to be clearly outlined to develop a <br>distinct training programme. The organisation, guided by the kind of training that is required, can t hen decide <br>whether the training will be done away from work or at work.  <br>After any kind of training is completed, it should  be evaluated to see if it accomplished what it set out to <br>achieve. Feedback following the evaluation will feed into a reformulation o f organisati onal objectives and/or <br>identification of new training needs. The organisation should also provide the employee s with an environment <br>that is conducive to applying what they learned for them to realise the outcomes of their investment in training . <br>13.3.3.1 T raining and development and the law in the South African context  <br>The National Qualifications Act 67 of 2008  <br>The South African educational system prior to 1994 was subdivided where different sectors did not receive <br>education of equal quality. So  organisations, especially small businesses, usually find themselves facing skills <br>shortages or they may  have people wit h qualifications whose quality may be questionable at best. As a way <br>of establishing a body that will oversee the quality of education a nd training in the country, as well as <br>accrediting institutions that offer education, the South African Qualifications ( SAQA) Act 58 of 1995 was <br>promulgated and started operating in May 1996. SAQA’s main mission was to institute the National <br>Qualifications  Framework (NQF). The NQF provides a platform for a nation -wide system of learning that <br>assesses and integrates all leve ls of education and training in the country.  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 214 <br> Figure 13.7 The training process  <br> <br>By 2001 the NQF was under review, result ing in the SAQA Act being replaced by the National Qualifications <br>Framework Act 67 of 2008. The primary objective of SAQA is to promote an education and training system <br>that is of high quality and encompasses lifelong learning. The authority promotes acces s to quality education <br>as well as skills development for all South Africans, thereby improving their lives. “SAQA is commi tted to <br>the de velopment of an NQF that facilitates articulation, recognition, access and redress across education, <br>training and workpl ace learning; where learners, especially the youth in rural and the poorest communities, <br>are adequately served by the SAQA  through its N QF advocacy, qualification and career development and <br>advice services” (SAQA, n.d.: 7). Through communication and collab oration with different stakeholders in <br>different countries, SAQA is also able to recognise other forms of learning and exp erience throug h a process <br>of Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) that can help candidates to access formal learning. They also evaluat e <br>and align qualifications obtained in different countries with their NQF.  <br>215 <br> The Skills Development Act  <br>In 1998, following t he realisation  and acknowledgement of the high unemployment levels and shortage of <br>skills in South Africa, the government promulgated the Skills Development Act (SDA) 97 of 1998. The main <br>purposes of the Act encompass the need to improve the skills of the country’s work force, thereby increasing <br>their quality of life, self -employment prospects, service delivery, productivity and the abili ty to compete <br>globally. The Act further wanted “to improve the employment prospects of persons previously disadvantaged <br>by unfair discri mination and to redress those disadvantages through training and education”. Other aims were <br>to encourage employers to p rovide employees with learning opportunities and/or learnerships while at work; <br>and improve the quality of education and i n so doing inc rease employment chances of new entrants to the <br>labour market or any other people who might have been unemployed. A lear nership means “a learning <br>programme that leads to an occupational qualification or part qualification and includes an appr enticeship and  <br>cadetship” (Skills Development Act 97 of 1998).  <br>To realise the goals of the SDA, some bodies were established.  <br>• The Nati onal Skills Authority:  acts as an advisory body to the minister of labour on the development and <br>implementation of the Nat ional Skills D evelopment Strategy and policy as well as advice on the <br>administration of subsidies of the National Skills Fund. The Nat ional Skills Development Strategy III (2011 –<br>2016) has contributed to quality lifelong education in the working environment . This has bee n done by <br>tackling the need to improve national skills by emphasising the improved use of learning linked to <br>occupationa lly directed programmes. The strategy also advocates for the practice of worker -initiated <br>training initiatives to eventual ly improve ser vice delivery. The NSDS especially encourages and supports <br>the development of cooperatives and SMMEs.  <br>• The Sector Educati on and Training Authorities  (SETAs) were also established to develop sector -skills plans <br>linked to the NSD and to promote and establish learnerships. SETAs also distribute grants to participating, <br>registered organisations on the condition that those organi sations have crafted and sub mitted reports on <br>workplace skills plans and how they were implemented.  <br>The Skills Development  Levies Act  <br>According to the Skills Development Levies Act 9 of 1999, all employers are required to pay 1 per cent of all <br>their employ ers’ pay as a skills develop ment levy towards the National Skills Fund every month. Some public <br>service and some non -profi t-making institutions like religious organisations are excluded from this. Small <br>businesses whose total annual pay to all their employ ees is less than R250 000 an d are exempt from registering <br>for tax are also excluded. So it is important that small busines ses verify their situation so as to comply with <br>legislation.  <br>13.3.4 Compensation and employee benefits management  <br>Compensation refers to all payments and benefits  that can be monetary or non -monetary and are used to reward <br>employees for satisfactory perfor mance. It is crucial for organisations, big and small, to develop effective <br>compensation systems as they help in attracting and retain ing talented employees.  <br>13.3.4.1 Salaries and/or wages  <br>Monetary payments to employees include wages, base salaries as well  as pay bonuses, and pay rises that can <br>be determined by factors such as the type of organisation (in terms of industry and size, i.e.  small or bigger <br>businesses) , the type of job an individual does and the level of the employee within the hierarchy of the  <br>organisation. Organisations usually have to decide on pay levels and pay structures. The amount of money <br>paid to employees, i.e. the pay level, describes how the  organisation’s payment of its employees compares <br>with other similar jobs and/or organisations  within the same industry. Organisations can either have high or <br>low pay levels. The pay levels are also linked to the need for sustai nable competitiveness and th e overall <br>strategy of the organisation, e.g. a low -cost strategy may call for lower employee s alaries. High pay levels can <br>have an added advantage of attracting and retaining employees, in most cases talented employees. Small 216 <br> businesses may struggle to att ract highly  qualified workers if they have limited funds and thus might offer <br>lower pay levels  than the bigger and more established businesses.  <br>Pay structures classify jobs according to different categories. These can include th eir relevance to the <br>organis ational goals (e.g. core job versus supplementary jobs) and the level of required skills. Pay ranges are <br>determined for each job category/class. Within each category the pay of employees is determined by the <br>position of the jobh older, as well as performanc e or skill/educational level. In big organisations, top managers <br>and CEOs are often paid large  salaries that small businesses may not be able to afford, putting them at a <br>disadvantage to compete for talented employees.  <br>Wage and salary systems  <br>• Job-based pay  is one of the wage and salary systems that can be utilised and it is the most common <br>approach  employed by organisations. Job -based pay links compensation to specific tasks that employees <br>perform. It is also linked to the positi on of an employee within a s pecific category of jobs. Unfortunately <br>this type of pay system does not necessarily acknowled ge nor develop individual performance and puts <br>emphasis on organisational hierarchies and centralised decision making.  <br>• Skill -based pay  systems, also called compet ency -based pay, put emphasis on remunerating employees <br>according to their level of competency.  This type of system encourages employees to develop their skills, <br>thereby increasing their employability should they leave their curr ent employer.  <br>• Pay-for-perfor mance  also aligns remuneration with employee effort and productivity. Remuneration can <br>then be  through merit -based pay, bonus payment when certain goals or targets have been achieved, <br>commission, team incentives and numerous gai n-sharing or profit -sharing plans. This means that <br>remuneration is linked to the behaviours that employees exhibit to achi eve organisational goals (Daft and <br>Benson, 2016).  <br>Whichever system an organisation decides to employ, it should ensure that their empl oyees perceive their pay <br>as fair and equitable. If compensation is perceived as not equitable, the employees will not be s atisfied with <br>their jobs and as a result productivity may suffer or employees might leave the organisation. Employers should <br>take note  of the specifications of re muneration that are stipulated in Chapter 4 of the BCEA that talk about <br>remuneration, calculat ion of remuneration, deductions and employer payments for employee benefits.  <br>13.3.4.2 Benefits  <br>Any compensation package necessitates i ncluding more than money for  it to be fully appreciated by employees <br>(Daft & Benson, 2016). According to Nel et al. (2014) , employee benefits are things that employers offer their <br>employees, on top of salaries, to increase the employees’ motivation and ove rall wellbeing. In South Afr ica, <br>the employee benefits are divided into those that are required by law, also known as mand atory benefits, and <br>those that are voluntary on the part of the employer. Voluntary benefits include  <br>• medical aid and health insurance  <br>• housing subsidy  <br>• meals at work  <br>• day-care centres or fitness facilities.  <br>Benefits that are mandated by the law are as present ed in  Table 13.1 . <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 217 <br> Table 13.1 Benefits that are required by the law  <br>Type of benefit  Applicable act  <br>1. Employees are entitled to have rest <br>days in the form of leave. There are <br>different types of leave dependi ng <br>on the reason the emp loyee wants <br>to be off work. Types of leave <br>include  <br>• annual leave  <br>• sick leave  <br>• maternity leave  <br>• family responsibility leave  The Basic Conditions of Employment Act 75 of 1997, Chapter 3, <br>describes the minimum number of days that employees  are entitled <br>to under t he different circumstances.  <br>2. Unemployment insurance  According to the Unemployment Insurance Act 63  of 2001, <br>employers (with some exclusions as stipulated in the act) and <br>employees are supposed to contribute to the unemployment <br>insur ance fund that employees, or their beneficiaries, can benefit <br>from in case t hey become unemployed, they are on maternity l eave <br>or they adopt, or they have temporary illness/incapacity that renders <br>them unable to work.  <br>3. Compensation for accidents and injuri es <br>at work (insurance)  Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases ( COIDA) Act <br>130 of 1993 (with some exclusions) spells out how employees can <br>claim for diseases or injuries incurred in the line of duty.  <br> <br>13.3.5 Health and safety  <br>It believed that  employees who are healthy will perform well at work.  Health  in this context is defined as a <br>general state of wellbeing in  terms of physical, psychological/ mental and spiritual fitness, i.e. health in <br>totality. Thus employers should do their utmost to hel p their employees keep healthy and maintain a working <br>environ ment that is safe and conducive to productivity. Employee sup port can be through Employee <br>Assistance Programmes (EAPs) or the more rounded, broader -focused programmes such as the Employee <br>Wellnes s Programmes (EWP). These programmes, which can be establishe d by employers, help in promoting <br>a healthy lifestyle and ide ntify potential problems or detect problems early; treat employees with health <br>challenges as well as other life challenges (e.g. battl ing with finances, substance/alcohol abuse); and follow  up <br>with all employees, healthy or unhealthy. EWPs are therefore pr oactive and go beyond the traditional <br>programmes that assist employees only when they present with problems, i.e. reactive programmes.  <br>Safety  in the workplace implies maintaining an environment t hat is free from hazards in order to protect <br>employees’ well -being. Organisations should minimise hazards in the workplace through advocacy, training <br>and sensitisation of employees for them to ad opt safe working practices. Depending on the type of work and  <br>organisation, employees should be provided with protective d evices/equipment to minimise injury/hazards.  <br>The Occupational Health and Safety (OHSA) Act 85 of 1993 was promulgated to replace the M achinery and <br>Occupational Safety Act 6 of 1983 to ensure that  employees are healthy and they work in environments that <br>are safe. The Act stipulates the functions of employees and employers to ensure health and safety as well as <br>make provision for safety re presentatives at work and an advisory council on occupational  safety. The <br>Compensation of Occupational Injuries and Diseas es (COIDA) Act 130 of 1993 regulates the payment to <br>persons who get injured at work or contract diseases while working, or who die fro m those injuries or illnesses.  218 <br> 13.4 EMPLOYMENT TERMINATION  <br>As indicated in  section 13. 1.2 of this chapter termination of employment is the last st age of the HRM process. <br>Factors that have to be included in t he employment contract are regulated by the BCEA, which also regulates <br>the termination of employment contracts. The employing organisa tion should also stipulate conditions under <br>which contracts m ay be terminated and the period that should be given by eithe r the employer or employee <br>when terminating a contract. Termination of employment is when the employment contract entered into comes <br>to an end. On the part of the employee, this termination can e ither be voluntarily through resignation or <br>involuntarily thr ough death. Termination can also come from the employer through processes such as <br>rightsizing or retrenchments, as well as dismissals.  Where applicable, small -business owners should consult <br>trade  unions when planning to retrench so that they get their coop eration as much as possible. Furthermore, in <br>the case of retrenchments and dismissal, organisations  should try to be consistent in the ir procedures and <br>should endeavour not to be seen as discrimi natory in their practices. Small businesses and all other <br>organisations should take care not to discriminate against employees when they dismiss them. In cases of <br>disputes following termination o f contracts, the LRA can be consulted on procedures that can be followed to <br>address such disagreements.  <br>13.5 CHALLENGES OF  HR FOR SMMEs IN EMERGING ECONOMIES  <br>The human talent in any organisation is the backbone of that organisation; it can make or break th e <br>organisation as it is the core of productivity, the organis ation’s competitive edge and long -term sustainability. <br>Howeve r, it is always a challenge to attract the right candidates, maintain and retain them. The challenge <br>seems to be even more for small b usinesses that are often characterised by:  <br>1. Lack of a person/department dedicated specifically to human resources managemen t: quite often the <br>owner/manager handles the HR function, without any written standards of operation or even an HR <br>plan (Werner & Herm an, 2012). The reliance on the owner may al so suggest that processes will be done <br>the way the owner prefers, opening up po ssibilities for irregularities. Lack of an HR plan is also often <br>coupled with a lack of job descriptions, which end up being determine d by the owner/manager on an ad <br>hoc case -by-case basis. Eventual performance may be negatively affected.  <br>Not having a depa rtment that focuses specifically on HR functions can be to the detriment of small businesses <br>as we live in turbulent times. Planning f or anything business -related, including pla nning for human talent, <br>needs continuous monitoring and adjustment of business processes so that goals and objectives remain <br>competitive  <br>2. Lack of, or limited finance:  several researchers have shown that SMMEs often  do not have the type <br>of finance tha t larger businesses have, which is a constraint in so many ways (Lekhanya & Mason, 201 4; <br>Abor & Quartey, 2010; Kongolo, 2010). As a result, they are often faced with several challenges within <br>the HRM process that include : <br>• Recruitment:  during recruitment, s mall businesses often rely on the methods and/or media that are <br>convenient and less co stly, like newspapers, referrals, word of mouth, and boards and signs outside their <br>premises that encourage walk -in applicants. It is believed that these methods may be e ffective in attracting <br>certain types of employees, especially those who are unemployed  and tend to walk around with their CVs. <br>These employees may not necessarily be the most qualified or skilled (Hargis & Bradley, 2011) . <br>• Selection:  in the course of select ion, small businesses tend again to use the cost -effective methods of face -<br>to-face int erviews mostly as the basis for their selection decisions. Bigger businesses with better financial <br>muscle may use other methods like a ssessment centres, for instance, hel ping them to make better -informed <br>decisions during the selection of candidates (Hargis  & Bradley, 2011).  219 <br> • Compensation packages:  these are some of the main factors that organisations utilise to attract and retain <br>capable and talented personnel. In an ideal situation, prospective employees are often attracted to an <br>organisation by the remuner ation package offered. So it is very challenging for the often cash -strapped <br>SMMEs to compete effectively against big businesses as th ey cannot offer the large salaries t hat big business <br>can offer. As a result they often have to settle for those employees who are willing to settle for lower <br>salaries, mostly while they still search for better opportunities. These types of employees often leave as soon <br>as such awaited prospe cts present themselves. Consequently, SMMEs often have to struggle with <br>recruitment co sts and/or working with inexperienced employees and training new employees. Not being <br>able to compete financially also makes them a tr aining ground for bigger companies, as they employ <br>inexperienced people who leave them for better salaries once they have gained the requisite experience <br>that big companies often look for.  <br>• Training and development:  the lack of finance also often implies th at there is very little money that c an be <br>utilised to train and develop their employees, further confounding the problem o f lower competencies <br>within SMMEs. Again due to restricted finances, small businesses may frequently opt for on -the-job training <br>as th e only source of training and develo pment (Hargis & Bradley, 2011). This may therefore imply that <br>employees miss out on op portunities to learn from different environments, experiences or the rich <br>knowledge that can be gained from interacting with fellow wo rkers in conferences or lecture sess ions.  <br>• Equipment and/or infrastructural development:  small businesses usually have to c ontend with insufficient <br>resources either within their organisations or in the environment where they operate (Lekhanya & Mason, <br>2014) . Internally they may at times have to settle for older or outdated equipment that may present health -<br>and-safety hazards. Alternatively they may decide to outsource services as they may not have the requisite <br>equipment and/or infrastructure. At times outso urcing is of core functions, increas ing the small businesses’ <br>costs and in that way decreasing their profitability and lik elihood of long -term growth and sustainability.  <br>• Policies:  unfortunately small businesses often function without any formal policies (W erner & Herman, <br>2012) such as those on recruitment and selection; remuneration; performance appraisal; or training and <br>development. This suggests that these procedures may then be conducted in an informal, ad hoc way that <br>can be open to inconsistencies, wh ich can lead to inadvertent discrimi nations.  <br> <br>3. Advancements in information and communication technology (ICT):  in terms of I CT small businesses are <br>disadvantaged in two ways. Firstly, advancements in ICT have made it easy for organisations globally to find <br>information about any other organisat ion, including information on organisational talent and competencies, so it is <br>easy fo r bigger organisations to poach employees from smaller businesses and head -hunt them. Conversely, it is also <br>easy for employees of sma ller businesses to take a moment to look for work all over the world even during office <br>hours. The second way in which sma ll businesses are at a disadvantage is that due to lack of finance they often do <br>not buy the most sophisticated or up -to-date technolo gy that can help their businesses in  terms of marketing <br>themselves and reaching bigger markets. Most importantly, small bu sinesses are unable to hire people who are <br>technologically competent enough for these small businesses to be able to compete with bigg er corporates.  <br>4. The global economy:  due to competition in the global world, both big and small businesses are forced <br>to pro duce goods and services of high quality that can compete globally. Quality production requires <br>competent, talented personnel. South Af rica still has challenges regarding lack of skills, which is worse <br>for small businesses that are struggling financially. A gain quality production requires the use of high -<br>quality, technologically advanced equipment, which small businesses usually do not ha ve. <br>5. Quality of working life:  an aver age working person spends more time at work than at any other place, <br>so it is importan t that the quality of life at work is perceived to be good. According to Warnich et al. <br>(2015), quality of working life (QWL) “refers to the extent to which employees’ pe rsonal needs are met <br>through their work”. A strong supportive work environment is esse ntial to enhance the QWL. Among <br>some of the programmes that bigger corporates put into place are the wellness programmes already <br>menti oned as well as some of the benefits  that are included in the remuneration packages. A lot of the <br>time these are some of t he perks that small businesses unfortunately cannot afford, which can act as a <br>serious demotivator, leading to low job satisfaction an d turnover.  <br>6. Legislation and regulato ry framework:  the South African working environment, especially since 1994, <br>has been i mpacted by many Acts, policies, strategies, rules and regulations that control the employer -<br>employee -government relationship. In addit ion to these labour -relations polici es, the small -business <br>sector has also seen promulgation of laws that regulate and sup port the development of small <br>businesses in the country. Unfortunately, not all small business owners/managers are fully aware of the 220 <br> plethora of Acts, policies, strategi c frameworks and standards of operation. They may therefore miss out <br>on some of the en abling opportunities on the one hand, while on the other hand they may find <br>themselves facing problems if they do not observe some of the regulatory directives that the c ountry <br>has. <br>13.6 CONCLUSION  <br>Small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) can be key to the economy in developing economies of all <br>countries, emerging ones included. For them to contribute effectively to the economy, they need to be <br>competitive and sustainable. Competitiveness and sust ainability can be achieved through the employment and <br>effective use of talented and competent human resources. Recruiting and selecting the right candidate who <br>possesses such requisite skills is crucial to all organisations, especially small businesses as they are still <br>primarily striving to establish themselves in a competitive business environment. Acquiring the correct skills <br>and competencies is only the first step; it needs to be followed b y placing these competencies in the right <br>positions, at the righ t time. Having people with talent and skill, who are inapp ropriately placed, i.e. put in the <br>wrong positions during staffing, may defeat the purpose of attracting and acquiring them in the fir st place.  <br>To maintain the recruited talent, it is important to o rientate them well to the organisation, compensate them <br>well and offer them opportunities for further improvement of skills through training and development <br>programmes. Employees’ performance should be appraised and well managed to assist in the further <br>compensation and development of employees. Organisations als o need to ascertain that their employees are <br>healthy for them to continue to be productive. It is unfortunate that small businesses ar e often inundated with <br>high turnover rates as they do not have e nough finance to offer all the developmental perks and inc entives that <br>can motivate employees to be committed to their employers.  <br>An important aspect to always keep in mind throughout the HRM process is the impact of labour legislation <br>on all practices and  procedures undertaken. For the SMME sector, there is an a ddition of small -business <br>legislation that supports and/or regulates the sector. Diligent and effective HRM, and also compliance with all <br>the regulatory framework are crucial for SMMEs to be able to  contribute effectively to their local economies.  <br>REVIEW Q UESTIONS  <br>13.1 Look back at the opening  case study  in this chapter in terms of HRM.  Advise Lerato on what to do for:  <br>13.1. 1 the cell -phone retail and repair shop  <br>13.1. 2 the overall shopping centre.  <br>13.2 You have just opened a small catering shop in Tembisa township, Gauteng. Outline the steps you will follow to recruit a <br>cleaner for the shop. Specifically focus on the specific media you will use to advertise the position and give reasons <br>for using them.  <br>13.3 In your ow n words discuss an employment contract and the factors/information you think should be included in one.  <br>13.4 Which South A frican Act regulates the standard number of hours an employee can work per day/week? In the  opening <br>case  of this chapter, Lerato also realises that Mokgadi is eight months pregnant and both Mmakoma and Matome’s <br>exhau stion  is because they have been working excessively long hours. What  advice should  Lerato give to Mr <br>Modiselle in terms of the provisions of this Act?  <br>13.5 Why should a training programme be evaluated at the end of training?  221 <br> 13.6 In some organisations, performance appraisal is conducted by the supervisor/manager of the emp loyee while in  others <br>the subordinates, customers and colleagues are also included in the appraisal. What would the advantages and <br>disad vantages be of including all the other people in a performance appraisal?  <br>13.7 “A healthy workforce guarantees better pe rformance”.

It thus <br>provides an overview of the following: the nature of entrepreneurial finance in developi ng economies; <br>entrepreneurial  financial needs; sources of finance and capital; and financial investment decisions.  <br>14.1.1 The concept and distinctiveness of entrep reneurial finance in emerging economies  <br>Although in some instances the concept of entrepreneu rial finance might include te chnical expertise, this <br>chapter’s focus is on financial availability to emerging -market entrepreneurs and the valuation method. The <br>funding environment for entrepreneurs in emerging countries is an amalgam of financing choices including <br>business angels, fi nancial bootstrapping and venture funding. Business angels are rich individuals or a group <br>of rich individuals (equity crowd funding) who privately invest their wealth or funds to assist start -up or <br>beginner entrepreneurs to es tablish their businesses with  a view to having a share of the firm’s profits. Venture <br>capital funders, on the other hand, are companies that collect funds from wea lthy individuals and invest such <br>funds on behalf of the owners in entrepreneurial businesses in return for shares. Venture  capital funders are <br>more interested in established entrepreneurs but may sparingly fund beginner entrepreneurs if such businesses <br>are in high -tech operations with promising returns (The Business Angel, 2016).  <br>Current research findings indicate, paradoxica lly though, that the conventional institutional economics <br>approach for enhancing entrepreneurial growth through an improved business e nvironment may not <br>unequivocally hold for emerging economies (Reynolds, Bygrave & Erkko, 2004 ; Lingelbach, De La Vina & <br>Asel, 2005). Opportunities for entrepreneurship venturing are still enormous in developing and emerging <br>markets and some experts think t hat many of these opportunities are untapped. However, prospects of the <br>speedy development of  growth -oriented entrepreneur ship in emerging countries is limited by the low level of <br>individual and family savings coupled with an apparent dearth of financial i nnovation (Lingelbach et al., <br>2005). Apart from personal or family financial assistance, emer ging market entrepreneurial f inance is heavily <br>reliant on informal sources of financing and research indicates that more than 80 per cent, and in some <br>instances, 1 00 per cent  of finance is raised from informal sources. Moreover, beginner entrepreneurs may 224 <br> hardly succeed in accessing b ank or venture financing (Bygrave, 2003; Lingelbach et al., 2005). The difficulty <br>in raising formal finance for emerging market entrep reneurs is somewhat cushioned by the low level of capital <br>that is required to start up a new business. Hence internal sour ces of finance would include savings from <br>salaries and retained earnings from previous entrepreneurial businesses.  <br>14.1.2 The nature o f entrepreneurial finance in South Africa  <br>Entrepreneurial finance in South Africa follows the nature of entrepreneurship i n the republic. Therefore, <br>given the embryonic nature of entrepreneurship interest in South Africa, it is not surprising that financin g is <br>also diminutive in comparison to othe r emerging economies.  <br>Accessing entrepreneurial finance has proved difficult for  entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs in <br>developing economies including South Africa (Co, 2015; Bruton, Khavul, Siegel, & Wright,  2015). The <br>conventional financing systems  in South Africa do not offer low -cost financing to business visionaries looking  <br>for little amounts of money to boost or to start new businesses.  <br>The average South African has a low penchant for savings with a high  consumption appetite that comes with <br>urbanisation. Additionally, the low saving rate in South Africa is exacerbated by an  unrestrained penchant for <br>credit overload that results in heavy indebtedness (see, for example, Trading Economics, 2016). Under this <br>condition, individuals and/or families may  hardly save enough private finance to start up a small business. <br>“South African s are renowned for being big spenders and not savers” (Thomas, 2015).  <br>According to the  Financial Mail , as of 2015, a shockingly high p roportion of households was unable to save . <br>Access to entrepreneurial finance in South Africa is uneven for all groups. Re search indicates that while race <br>and gender affect access to finance, women in particular are at the bottom of this access (Naidoo & H ilton, <br>2006), and this is worrying in the current national and global dispensation where gender equality is a priority <br>for the United Nations Millennium Development goals.  <br>14.2 FINANCING SOURCES FOR AN ENTREPRENEUR  <br>A new entrepreneur requires funding, whic h may transcend the money supplied by family, friends and <br>personal savings or bank overdrafts, including credit cards. How ever, as the entrepreneur develops courage <br>and veers into somewhat higher -return and riskier projects, a higher level of financing is needed. The first <br>choice for a more financially demanding entrepreneurial project is angel financing (as discussed in <br>section 14.2.2.1 ), and research indicates that angel -financed beginner entrepreneurs hav e a high potential for <br>success. In addition to angel financing, venture capital offers two im portant resources to the entrepreneurs. <br>The first is the much needed finance for high -growth businesses, and the second is the skill and expertise to <br>support the s trategic planning and operations of the business to ensure that anticipated high return is <br>achievable.  <br>This section presents some comm on sources of financing for entrepreneurs (these include: internal and <br>external sources of financing).  <br>14.2.1 Internal fin ancing sources (or financial bootstrapping)  <br>Entrepreneurial financial bootstrapping constitut es all sources of finance through which e ntrepreneurs can <br>raise finance without any reliance on institutional (or market) sources (see, for example, Winborg & <br>Land ström, 2001: 247). Looking inwards to begin a business is a source of competitive advantage f or the <br>beginner entrepreneur. This is bec ause knowing that “I am doing it for myself” instils a humble and cherished <br>astute financial usage skill where the slogan of the entrepreneur might be “any cent in this business may not <br>drop to the floor because it counts”. Bootstrapping is becoming increa singly important considering the low 225 <br> economic growth in many countries, the credit crunch and rising financial costs. This  form of entrepreneurial <br>finance sourcing is advantageous in that it is somewhat easy. It als o has no financial costs and does not req uire <br>the filing of any paper and is devoid of collateral. Furthermore, financial bootstrapping offers a greater degree <br>of independence to the entrepreneur.  <br>14.2.2 External financing sources  <br>While progressing on a gr owth trend, some entrepreneurial business es may frequently require more capital <br>than the entrepreneurs can afford to provide. Consequently, they would normally sou rce financing from <br>outside the business and consider investment speculators such as from vent ure capitalists and angel investors. <br>Although there might be other pockets of external finance, business -angel financing and venture -capitalist <br>finance are the maj or sources of finance available to the entrepreneurs and these are discussed in the following  <br>sections.  <br>14.2.2.1 Business -angel financ ing <br>A business angel is a private speculator who contributes some portion of his or her own particular riches and <br>time in early -stage inventive organisations. Aside from getting a decent return, business -angel inves tors also <br>strive to have a fabulous time with the entrepreneurial business by spending useful advisory time with the <br>entrepreneurial business. Research indicates t hat business -angel funders make up to three times more <br>investments than venture capital inves tors. Finance historians and finance law experts (see Ibrahim, 2009: <br>717; Leslie & Kargon, 1996), indicate that the emergence of business -angel financing can be tr aced to <br>Frederick Terman, broadly credited to be the father of Silicon Valley (together with William Shockley). <br>History indicates that  Frederick Terman – an American engineer and professor who lived from 7 June 1900 <br>to 19 December 1982 – was reckoned to ha ve facilitated the beginning of a renowned company started by Bill <br>Hewlett and Fred Packard t hrough his $500 contribution.  <br>14.2.2.2 Ve nture capital financing  <br>Perhaps it is pertinent to provide a grassroots description of venture capital, often abbreviated as VC. In <br>entrepreneurship finance, venture capital refers to the cash that is made available  to seed start -ups, potentially <br>emerging high-profit oriented entrepreneurs. Venture capitalists are interested in high -profit -return <br>entrepreneurships, therefore venture funders put resources into potential financially credible businesses in <br>return for va lue in the organisations in which they pu t resources. More often than not, these businesses have <br>a novel innovation or plan of action in high -innovation commercial  ventures, for example, information and <br>technology businesses. The normal funding speculation  happens after a seed -financing round as the first round <br>of institutional money to propel and cushion the development of the new business.  <br>14.2.2.3 Financing stage s of venture capital  <br>There are varied opinions about the venture -capital financing stages or processes. The stages are succinctly <br>explained next. It is believed that the stages of venture capital may approximately relate to the stages of an <br>entrepreneurial  development, however, documented stages differ according to authors’ perceptions. These are <br>not sacrosanct stages, nevertheless, beca use different researchers and authors believe that each business may <br>present unique characteristics that are associated wi th the type of business, location, time, weather, culture, <br>economy and ownership. However, th e following five stages of venture financ ing is worth noting:  <br>14.2.2.4 The -seed funding stage  <br>The seed -funding stage is the entrepreneurial financing stage where s eed subsidising happens. It is considered <br>as the setup stage where the entrepreneur connects with the business -angel investor or a ven ture-capitalist <br>funder to seek funding for a proposed entrepreneurial project. This is considered an important stage where  the <br>entrepreneur should apply convincing and credible strategy to persuade the investor that  the entrepreneurship <br>project, as formula ted, has potential growth and profitability, and warrants funding and risk.  226 <br> Figure 14.1 Stages of venture financing  <br> <br>A brief case illustration of the seed -funding stage  <br>A typical example of events at this stage is a South African entrepreneur, whose bus iness we will call Vusi School Uniforms. <br>On completion of tailoring training, Vusi wanted to start his own business. He conceived a good idea to supply uniforms to <br>primary schools in the rural areas of Limpopo province. A good business indeed, but as an or phan he had no relatives to <br>provide family finance and, of course, few friends as he was confined to the orphanage where  he eventually learned tailoring. <br>To begin this business, Vusi needed finance and some knowledge of marketing functions to create awaren ess and to <br>research the marketability of school uniforms to the rural schools. He approached a known South African bank with his well -<br>crafted ideas on paper including some samples of school uniforms with badges; his expected annual sales; and projected <br>profits. The bank executives were moved by Vusi’s professional presentation and after a month of internal consultation, the  <br>bank sent their team of experts to some rural schools to do some brief research into the potential demand. Subsequent to <br>the bank’s pri vate expert investigations, the bank invited Vusi to a meeting and communicated the bank’s decision to provide <br>Vusi with  a seed fund, a market reasercher and an appointed overseer from the bank’s head office to monitor the periodic <br>operations of Vusi’s bus iness to assist it in realising projected operations and profit. Hence, Vusi did not only secure seed <br>finance, but also secured non -financial resources.  <br> <br>Risk at the seed -funding stage  <br>Note that this stage of financing is fraught with risk and investors a re advised to diversify it. (For further reading on the risk <br>of seed funding see Wright, Liu, Buck & Filatotchev, 2015; Kh oury, Junkunc & Mingo, 2015; Ruhnka & Young, 1991; 1987).  <br>Venture capital investing decisions are complicated by a general lack of qua ntifiable financial and market data for early -<br>stage ventures, and investment decisions remain hostage to unanticipated com petitors, market shifts, and financial cycles. <br>Some observers have suggested that venture capital investment decisions are primarily s ubjective assessments.  <br> <br>14.2.2.5 The start -up financing stage  <br>When the initial project presentation by the business is ac cepted for funding as in the case above in Vusi <br>School Uniforms, the financing sequence proceeds to the next stage, referred to as the  start-up stage. During <br>this period, a more formalised presentation of the business plan is tabled and defended before the  management <br>of venture funders. In addition, it becomes pertinent here also to formalise the management of the business, <br>as seen from the Vusi  case study , the team from the bank could form part of the management team  at Vusi <br>School Uniforms coupled with Vusi’s managers. With the aid of the marketers, researchers and overseers from <br>the v enture-capital firm and the effort of the entrepreneur, production and the initial sale of the main product <br>could kick off here. This would test the market, the product or service and the entrepreneurial management <br>initiatives and capabilities.  <br>227 <br> A brief cas e illustration of the start -up financing stage  <br>For a good understanding of the topic, let us focus again on the Vusi School Uniforms e ntrepreneurial project. During this <br>phase, in conjunction with the bank experts in marketing and research, Vusi makes a br oader market inquisition by visiting <br>the schools with the bank experts. They try to determine the extent and  regularity of demand for uniforms. Using the results <br>obtained, Vusi develops a detailed current and projected business plan for revenue, expenses a nd potential profit. <br>Accordingly, since the bank experts believe in the project, the bank engages in a further analysis of the current  practical -<br>based plan with the forecasts. Being convinced that the business is worth the investment, the bank continues to  develop it <br>further.  <br> <br> <br>Risk at the start -up financing stage  <br>The venture capitalist’s risk of investing in the business is expected to  have shrunk by at least half after the start -up stage. This <br>is because many of the uncertainties prevalent in the seed st age would have been clarified after start -up. For instance, the risk <br>intrinsic in product acceptability, the risk of rejection by larg e, established competitors and the risk of low demand, etc. are <br>cleared at this stage. However, certain major risks, such as: unplanned product shifts by the consumers, social unrest that may <br>lead to school closures or school relocation, may still exist. I n addition, the venture financier may have, out of enthusiasm, <br>underestimated the risks of investing (Simon, Houghton & Aq uino, 2000). Research indicates that, in most instances, the <br>venture funders inadvertently underestimate the amount involved and that these risks are most prevalent in the funding of <br>biotech businesses (Baeyens, Vanacker & Manigart, 2006; Pereiro, 2015).  <br> <br>14.2. 2.6 Growth -stage financing  <br>During growth -stage financing, the entrepreneur’s plan, strategies and prototype product/s service/s becomes <br>operational. If it is a product, the normal production commences with product sales making a first formal <br>appearan ce in the competitive market. The main objective at this stage is to capture a significant market share <br>and to keep the costs of opera tion and sales as low as possible to hit at least a breakeven point (if not profit). <br>At the breakeven point, the entrepren eurial  total costs are equal to total revenue; this means the point where <br>there is no loss and no profit (Klychova, Zakirova, Zakirov & Valieva, 2015).  <br>A brief case illustration of growth -stage financing  <br>At the growth stage, Vusi School Uniforms is ready t o pack age the clothes to industrial and market -design standards. <br>However, Vusi’s training is limited regarding the finishing that is r equired to beat the competition, hence the bank provides <br>expert cloth designers to support Vusi’s standard design producti on. Ho wever, despite the additional support, the investor is <br>not satisfied with undue delays, which affected planned sales. The bank w ithholds the disbursement of anticipated funding <br>and gives Vusi a month to meet the bank’s standard design. In addition th e bank  provides Vusi with consulting fashion <br>designers to take over the design and finishing. Things turn positive and within one mont h, Vusi has completed the first batch <br>of designed uniforms, which the school principals confirm are outstanding in compari son to  other suppliers. Following this, the <br>bank releases some funds to Vusi’s business to enable continued production. It should be n oted that at the growth stage of <br>financing, the risk of the venture capitalist losing its investment drops significantly. The re ason is that the product is now in the <br>market. What is needed now is effective promotion and sales strategies.  <br>14.2.2.7 The exp ansion and maturity stage  <br>At the growth and expansion stage of venture -capital financing, the entrepreneur strives to make  more s ales <br>by using persuasive promotion campaigns to capture more market segments.  Knowing that the venture 228 <br> investor will participat e in the profit, the business strengthens cost efficiency to further reduce the cost of <br>operations and sales – this is pos sible b ecause the more experience the entrepreneur gains, the more he or she <br>is able to devise cost -reduction techniques to improve th e profit level. One way to achieve this is to apply the <br>SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) o f progr ess so far.  <br>14.2.2.8 Bridge -financing stage  <br>The bridge -financing stage is often the last phase of venture financing for an entr epreneurial business. Bridge <br>financing is normally made available by existing venture capitalists to the entrepreneur. The  main purpose of <br>bridge funding is “to provide the entrepreneur with sufficient cash to ‘bridge’ the time gap between running <br>out of e arlier raised capital and the closing of a round of new funding for the company” (Payne, 2016, 2). <br>Bridging finance is nec essary because subsequent investors want their mone y to be used purely to develop the <br>business and not to repay debts, therefore the b ridging finance might be converted to formal debt if the <br>business decides to source equity financing in succeeding rounds of investment.  <br>14.3 FINANCIAL PLANNING FOR AN ENTR EPRENEUR  <br>14.3.1 The importance of financial planning  <br>Entrepreneurs should prepare fi nancial plans to enable them to conceptualise how much cash they might be <br>able to generate from their business and the qua ntity of production they will have to produce to b e able to <br>break even and make the anticipated profit. The level of production to mak e a profit is treated in the subsequent <br>sections under  section 14.4.5  – the breakeve n of an entrepreneur. Therefore, in the absence of a sound financial <br>plan, an entrepreneur might be misinformed about the likely profit of the business and this misinformation <br>may lead to two negative actions. On the one hand, if profit is wr ongly estimate d; the entrepreneur could take <br>the wrong decision of going into business with a high probability of failure and loss of in vested capital. On <br>the other hand, if the plan wrongly gives a loss, the entrepreneur could take a wrong decision of qui tting from <br>an otherwise profitable venture. A credible financial plan is not only for the entrepreneur’s personal decisions, <br>it also ass ists funders or investors in knowing if the business is potentially worthwhile to warrant the <br>investment and risk. As an  example, a hy pothetical cash flow plan for Vusi School Uniforms is presented <br>in Table 14.1 . From this, we can see that the cash burn rate (cash spent per day) for the first month in the first <br>quarter of 2017 for Vusi (in days) would be 14 565/30days = R456 per day – a fairly good cash burn rate <br>considering the rising prices in Sou th Africa.  <br>Table 14.1 Vusi School Uniforms – first quarter projected cash flow  <br>Vusi School Uniforms  <br>Projected cash flow for the first q uarter of 2017  <br>Expected cash receipts  Jan Feb March  <br>          Opening cash balance  11 000 14 565 3 727 <br>  Cash receipts from debtors  16 000 14 000 25 000 <br>  Loan from the bank  22 000  0 0 <br>Total expected cash receipts  49 000 28 565 28 727 229 <br> Vusi School Uniforms  <br>Projected cash flow for the first q uarter of 2017  <br>Expected cash p ayments  <br>  Purchase of raw materials and/or finished goods  7 000  6 000  6 000  <br>  Manufacturing expenses  3 000  3 000  3 000  <br>  Promotions /marketing  4 000  500 500 <br>  Insurance  225 225 225 <br>  Fees/licences  300 300 300 <br>  Food/entertainment  1 500  800 800 <br>  Office expenses  200 200 200 <br>  Consultants’ services  100 100 100 <br>  Miscellaneous expenses  250 250 250 <br>  Wages and salaries  3 500  3 500  3 500 <br>  Rental expenses  5 800  5 800  5 800  <br>  Internet & telephone  200 200 200 <br>  Motor vehicle maintenance  100 100 100 <br>  Utility bills  400 400 400 <br>  Travel costs  4 000  500 600 <br>  Payment on leased sewing machines  350 348 348 <br>  Bank loan repayment (princ ipal) 600 605 605 <br>  Bank loan repayment (interest servicing)  280 280 280 <br>  Vusi’s drawings  620 620 620 <br>  PAYE taxes  210 210 210 <br>  Employee benefits  800 800 800 <br>  Fees to accounting firm for advice  1 000  100 100 230 <br> Vusi School Uniforms  <br>Projected cash flow for the first q uarter of 2017  <br>Total expected cash payments  34 435  24 838 24 938  <br>  Closing cash balance for January (receipts less payments)  14 565  3 727  3 789  <br>14.3.2 Determining financial n eeds  <br>A good financial plan should enable entrepreneurs to understand the amount of capital they would seek to <br>obtain from the various sources discussed in the preceding sections. This means, therefore, that the future <br>success of the business would depend o n the  ability of the entrepreneur to: forecast the need for capital; <br>strategise toward the sourcing of this finance; and implement the  sourcing strategy to acquire the funds in <br>advance of the time that the funds are needed for production. It is widely beli eved that the major determinants <br>of entrepreneurs’ financial needs include, among others, the appropriate estimation of sales with the  associated <br>revenue and profit at each stage of growth; effective determination of commencement costs and the variable <br>costs that relate to the operations; and effective estimation of working capital to determine the potential <br>liquidity of the venture. Ent repreneurs’ financial planning may be smoother if entrepreneurs endeavour to <br>understand that financing is a process in the  life of the business. This suggests that entrepreneurs should <br>understand the various stages of financing to be abreast of what is req uired at each stage. This is important <br>because raising finance takes time, hence being aware enables the entrepreneur to p repar e a persuasive plan <br>in advance. However, entrepreneurs in developing countries face some problems that may limit effective <br>financ ial planning.  <br> <br>14.3.3 Financial -planning problems  <br>While dealing with most of the aforementioned sources of finance, develo ping countries’ entrepreneurs are <br>beset with numerous problems that  limit their financial -planning success and thereby also affect the ir growth <br>potential. Being aware of these problems is the first step in planning toward overcoming them. The financial <br>plans of  developing countries’ entrepreneurs are often viewed with scepticism, and this tends to diminish the <br>momentum of most entreprene urs. In addition, many developing or emerging countries still have dauntingly <br>stringent regulationsfor entrepreneurs, and empir ical research makes it clear that these regulations concerning <br>hiring of labour, appropriation of profit and exit from the market  all affect the decision of capable <br>entrepreneurs to enter into business or not to do so (Levie & Autio, 2011). Entreprene urs a lso face <br>uncertainties that limit their financial planning and growth (Von Gelderen, Frese & Thurik, 2000). <br>Uncertainties that ar e likely to affect entrepreneurial financial planning, include, inter alia, industry -level <br>uncertainty, uncertainty in the  firm or personally (Von Gelderen, Frese & Thurik, 2000: 7).  <br>However, this can be overcome by reading and asking questions on the fina ncial -planning trajectories of one’s <br>predecessors and sometimes mentors are willing to assist new or potential entrepreneu rs. The preceding issues <br>make entrepreneurship and the relevant funding risky and therefore entrepreneurial finance valuation will be <br>discussed next.  231 <br> 14.4 ENTREPRENEURIAL FINANCE VALUATION  <br>14.4.1 The role of time value  <br>The entrepreneur has to appreciate th at time increases the value of the investment. This subsection explains, <br>in a simple term, the future and present values of cash that is put aside for future use or that will be received <br>in future. The future value of money is the value of an amount in a c ertain future period (say two or three <br>years) that entrepreneurs put aside for their use in business. The present value of money is th e value of an <br>amount today of cash that would be received in future.  <br>14.4.1.1 The future value of savings  <br>The future value  of a single amount  <br>Example  <br>Vusi invests R1 000 at an interest rate of 10 per cent per annum and leaves it in the bank for four years.  <br>Question: how much would Vusi have in four years?  <br>Suggested solution  <br>Future value (FV) of a single amount = PA x FVIF in = R1 000 x FVIF 10%,4 = R1 000 x 1.464 = R1 464  <br>Where: PA = the present or current value  <br>FVIF = future value interest factor (from the t able in interest factor table in  Annexure A , at the end of this book)  <br>i = interest rate  <br>n = number of years  <br>How to check the present value factor from the tab les <br>Determine the number of years and interest rate,  proceed to the relevant interest factor tables (see  Annexure A , at the end of <br>this book). P lace your pencil on the applicable year on the year column, and then move your pencil horizontally (on that row) <br>toward the right -hand  side of that row to a point that intersects with the required interes t rate. The factor at that point is <br>the relevant int erest factor to use . <br>14.4.1.2 Equal annual savings  <br>If the entrepreneur saves an equal amount of money at the end of each period (end o f each year or end of each <br>month), it is referred to as “ordinary annu ity”. However, if the amount is put aside at the beg inning of each <br>period, it is referred to as “annuity due”. Since it is a common practice to put aside some money at the end of <br>a perio d when income is normally earned, the following example illustrates th e future value of ordinary <br>annuity where the entrepr eneur puts aside a certain amount at the end of each period.  <br>Example  <br>Vusi School Uniforms deposits R1 000 at the end of every year for  four years at a 10 per cent interest rate. Determine how <br>much Vusi would have saved at the end of four years.  <br>Suggested s olution  <br>Steps: refer to the future value interest factor of annuity ( FVIFA) table in  Anne xure A , at the end of this book. The simplest <br>approach to the above problem is by using the formula such that:  <br>Future value of annuit y = AI x FVIFA i,n = AI x FVIFA 10%4 = R1 000 x 4.641 = R4 641.  <br>Where:  232 <br> AI = amount invested now (or the present value)  <br>FVIFA  = future value interest factor of annuity  <br>i = interest factor = 10 p er cent  <br>n = number of years = 4 years  <br>14.4.1.3 Future value of mi xed stream of investments  <br>Example  <br>In order to derive the future value of a mixed stream of cash flows, the separate cash f lows would be treated as in the single <br>cash flow and all added together.  <br>Example: Vusi invest the following mixed amounts over a four -year period:  <br>Year  Amount  <br>2013  R10 000  <br>2014  R4 000  <br>2015  R6 000  <br>2016  R10 000  <br>Question: Determine the future value of Vu si’s investments at the end of the four years.  <br>Suggested solution  <br>Future value of mixed streams:  <br>  = R10 000 x FVIF 8%,4 + R4 000 x FVI F8%,3 + R6 000 x FVIF 8%,2 + R10 000 x FVIF 8%,1 <br>  = R10 000 x 1.360 + R4 000 x 1.260 + R6 000 x 1.166 + R10 000 x 1.080  <br>FV = R13 600 + R5 040 + R6 996 + R10 800 =  R36 436  <br>Note:  the year -one cash stream is multiplied by year four (last year) interest fact or; the year two cash stream is multiplied by <br>year three interest factor; the year three cash flow is multiplied by year t wo interest factor; the year four cash flow is multiplied  <br>by year one interest factor.  <br>14.4.1.4 The present value of an entrepreneur’s  future cash flows  <br>Entrepreneurs might want to know the present value of expected future cash inflow or outflow for their <br>financial planning. Similar to the future values, the present value should be determined for a single amount, <br>annual equal amounts (an nuity) and annual m ixed amounts.  <br>The present value of a single future amount  <br>Example  <br>The present value (PV) of an expected  single future cash inflow or outflow for an entrepreneur is = PV = FA x PVIFi,n (where: <br>FA = future amount; PVIF = present value inte rest factor; i = in terest rate; n = number of periods.  <br>Note: PVIF can be obtained from the interest factor table (present value interest factor) (see  Annexure A  at the end of this <br>book).  233 <br> Assume that Vusi expects to  receive R2 000 in four years from now at an interest rate of 10 per cent. How much is it worth <br>now?  <br>Suggested solution  <br>Present value of a single amount = PV = FA x PVI – Fi,n PV = R2 000 x 0.683 = R1 366  <br>The present value of a y early equal future stream o f cash flows (annuity)  <br>Example  <br>Vusi School Uniforms expects a future equal cash stream of R2 000 every year for four years at a 10 per  cent interest rate. <br>Determine the present value of these equal cash streams now.  <br>Suggested sol ution  <br>Steps: refer to the p resent value interest factor of annuity (PVIFA) table on  Appe ndix A4 . The simplest appro ach to the above <br>problem is by using the formula such that:  <br>Present value of expected annuity = FEA x PVIFA i,n = FA x PVIFA 10%4 = R2 0 00 x 3.170 = R6 340  <br>Where:  <br>FEA = future equal amounts = R2 000  <br>PVIFA = present value interest factor of annuity (derivable  from Annexure A , at the end of this book)  <br>i = interest factor = 10 per cent  <br>n = number of years = 4 years  <br>Present value of mixed stream of expected future cash flows  <br>Example  <br>In order to derive the present value of an expe cted mixed stream of future cash inflows or outflows, the separate cash flows <br>would be treated as a single cash flow but, in this case, all added together.  <br>Example: Vusi expects the following future mixed amounts over a four -year period at an interest rate  of 8 per cent:  <br>Year Amount  <br>2017  R10 000  <br>2018  R4 000  <br>2019  R6 000  <br>2020  R10 000  <br>Question: Determine the present value o f Vusi’s expected future cash flows now.  <br>Suggested solution  <br>Present value of mixed streams: = ΣFMA x PVIF i1-4 <br>  = R10 000 x PVIF 8%,1 + R4 000 x PVIF 8%,2 + R6 000 x PVIF 8%,3 + R10 000 x PVIF 8%,4 <br>  = R10 000 x 0.926 + R4 000 x 0.857 + R6 000 x 0.794 + R10 000 x 0.735  234 <br> PV = R9 260 + R3 428 + R4 764+ R7 350 =  R24 802  <br>Where:  <br>Σ = Summation (addition of four year’s computations); FMA = future mixed amounts; 1 –4 = period 1 to 4.  <br>Note:  the year -one cash stream is multiplied by the year -one interest factor, the year -two cash stream is multiplied by the <br>year-two interest fac tor …, etc.  <br>14.4.2 Risk and return  <br>Certain environmental factors, if unknown and unplanned for, might wreak havoc and  thus thwart the <br>entrepreneur’s objectives. These factors are called risks. Entrepreneurial risks could come from inside the <br>business (inte rnal risks) or from outside (external risks). Internal risks include, inter alia, risk of profit or loss; <br>risk of not  honouring debt -finance obligations; risk of not raising expected finance to meet business demand. <br>Internal risks could be controllable thr ough effective planning. External risks include, competition, and <br>political and economic risks. Though these are larg ely beyond the control of the entrepreneur, through <br>planning, the entrepreneur can learn to cope.  <br>14.4.2.1 Entrepreneur’s risk measurement  <br>An investor would analyse the risk of investing in various entrepreneurs’ businesses, similarly, entrepreneurs <br>should  analyse the risk of business or project options available to them. The approach to risk measurement is <br>the same – either from the investor ’s position or from the entrepreneur’s standpoint. The following example <br>illustrates the measuring of risk from the e ntrepreneur’s position (it can also be applicable to an investor’s <br>position).  <br>Example  <br>Vusi School Uniforms is considering two tailoring pro jects with a view to accepting the alternative with lower risk. The rate of <br>return (RR) and the probability (P) for both projects are as bellow:  <br>Boys school    P RR <br>  Term 1  0.4 10 <br>  Term 2  0.4 15 <br>  Term 3  0.2 20 <br>Girls school        <br>  Term 1  0.4 20 <br>  Term 2  0.4 30 <br>  Term 3  0.2 –12 <br>You are required to  <br>• determine and compare the expected return (profit) for both projects and the extent of risk using the standard <br>deviation and the coefficient of variation  <br>• decide which project Vusi should accept based on t he risk measurement and Vusi’s risk -averse investmen t <br>position.  <br> 235 <br> Suggested solution: Note: ER = (P) × (RR)  <br>Vusi’s expected rates of return for the boys school and girls school projects  <br>Alternative projects  Probability (P)  Rate of return (RR)  Expected retu rn [ER]  <br>Boys school                          <br>  Term 1    0.4 10   4   <br>  Term 2    0.4 15   6   <br>  Term 3    0.2 20   4   <br>      1     14   <br>Girls school                <br>  Term 1    0.4 20   8   <br>  Term 2    0.4 30   12   <br>  Term 3    0.2 –12   –2.4   <br>      1     17.6 =18  rounded up  <br>Measure of risks (standard deviation) & (coefficient of variation [CV])  <br>Boys school  RR ER (RR – ER) P (RR – ER)2 x P <br>  10 14 –4 0.4 6.4   <br>  15 14 1 0.4 0.4   <br>  20 14 6 0.2 7.2   <br>        variance: σ2 14 SD:σ=√14 <br>Girls school  RR ER (RR - ER) P (RR - ER)2 x P <br>  20 18 2 0.4 1.6   <br>  30 18 12 0.4 57.6   <br>  –12 18 –30 0.2 180   <br>        variance: σ2 239.2  SD:σ=√239. 2 <br>                       = 15.466  236 <br>   Coefficient of variati on       <br>Boys sc hool σ/ER  3.742/14  0.267286  =27%    <br>              <br>Girls school  σ/ER  15.466/18  0.859  =86%    <br>Although the girls school project would offer a higher expected return (profit) to Vusi, the risk as measured by standard <br>(s) deviation and coeffi cient of variatio n (CV) is higher in this project. Therefore a consideration of risk would make Vusi <br>consider project A (the boys school project) rather than B (girls school project). Note that the greater the standard <br>deviation and variance the greater th e risk associated  with a project or investment.  <br>14.4.3 The cost of entrepreneurial capital  <br>As the business grows, a time comes when it expands its sources of finance to the official or market sources, <br>which include, among others, ordinary shares and long -term debts (exhau stive discussions of these and o ther <br>sources are available in finance textbooks). Therefore, the cost of capital is how much it would cost the <br>entrepreneur to raise funds. This section shows how to compute the cost of two major sources of market or <br>officia l sources of capital (ordinary s hares and long -term debts).  <br>14.4.3.1 Cost of long -term debt  <br>The costs of obtaining long -term debts are the cost of the loans, which the entrepreneur will pay to the bank. <br>This can be calculated by using the following formula : <br>Cost of debt (C d) = C bt×× (1 – t). <br>Where: C d = cost of debt; C bt = before tax cost of debt;  t = tax rate  <br>Example  <br>Vusi School Uniforms has obtained a big project that requires a loan from the bank, and Vusi approached Nedbank to negotiate  <br>a R400 000 loan.  The bank granted the loan at a cost of 14 per cent (interest) per annum after considering the viability of the <br>entrepreneur. Vusi’s venture has now matured and pays a tax rate of 38 per cent. You are required to determine the cost of <br>Vusi’s debt capital.  <br>Suggested solution  <br>Cost of debt (C d) = C bt x (1 – t). = 0.14 (1 - 0.38) = 0.09 or 9%  <br>14.4.3.2 The cost of ordinary shares  <br>The cost of ordinary shares is the cost of raising funds by issuing ordinary shares. The cost of ordinary shares <br>can be obtained by ap plying the constant growth model formula, this is known as the Gord on’s constant growth <br>model. Therefore the cost of ordinary shares (C s) can be obtained as follows:  <br> Cs =Dps<br>Ps +g <br> <br>Where: C s = cost of ordinary shares; D ps = dividen d per share; P s = pric e per ordinary share; g = constant <br>growth rate in firm’s dividend.  237 <br> Example  <br>Vusi is considering an expansion into the stock market with an anticipated price per share of R20 and a forecast dividend per  <br>share of R2. Vusi hopes that the dividend will gr ow ann ually by 8 per cent. Determine the cost of Vusi’s ordinary shares by <br>applying the constant growth model. Suggested solution  <br>Suggested solution  <br>Cs=2/20+8%  <br>=0.10 0+0.08 <br>=18% <br>14.4.4 Capital budgeting techniques  <br>The term “capital budgeting technique” refers to  the methods used to make capital investment appraisals. <br>These appraisals involve current investments that are made in expectation of a future inflow of cash benefits. <br>Investment decisions are most vital for the business as they involve the commitment of a  significant portion <br>of the firm’s wealth. A detailed discussion of capital investment techniques is available in finance textbooks. <br>This section presents straightforward a nd easy -to-understand basic techniqu es for entrepreneurial capital <br>investment apprai sal. The following example is used to illustrate three capital investment appraisal techniques: <br>the net present value technique (NPV), the payback period technique (PP) and  the average rate of return <br>(ARR). D espite the availability of numerous techniques f or evaluating potential investment choices, the NPV <br>remains the preferred choice for evaluating investment alternatives.  <br>14.4.4 Capital budgeting techniques  <br>The term “capital budgeting technique” refers to the methods used to make capital investment apprai sals. <br>These appraisals involve current investments that are made in expectation of a future inflow of cash benefits. <br>Investment decisions are most vital for the business as they involve the commitment of a significant portion <br>of the firm’s wealth.

Vusi’s current resources only enable him to selec t the project with the best prospect of profit. Vusi’s current cost of <br>capital is 15 per cent, the projects’ respective investments and cash flows over seve n years are:  <br>  Initial investment  Annual cash flow  <br>Navy  R400 000  R110 000  <br>Army  R400 000  R105 000  <br>Air force  R400 000  R120 000  <br>Question  <br>Present the above investment analysis using the net present value (NPV), the payback period and the average rate of return <br>techniques.  238 <br> Navy     Army  <br>Year  Cash flows  PVIF 15% Present value    Year  Cash flows  PVIF 15% Prese nt value  <br>1 110 000  0.87 95 700    1 105 000  0.87 91 350  <br>2 110 000  0.756  83 160    2 105 000  0.756  79 380  <br>3 110 000  0.658  72 380    3 105 000  0.658  69 090  <br>4 110 000  0.572  62 920    4 105 000  0.572  60 060  <br>5 110 000  0.497  54 670    5 105 000  0.497  52 185  <br>6 110 000  0.432  47 520    6 105 000  0.432  45 360  <br>7 110 000  0.376  41 360    7 105 000  0.376  39 480  <br>Present value of inflows  457 710    Present value of inflows  436 905  <br>Less initial investment  400 000    Less initial investment  400 000  <br>NPV 57 710    NPV 36 905  <br>Air Force  <br>Year  Cash flows  PVIF 15% Present value  <br>1 120 000  0.87 104 400  <br>2 120 000  0.756  90 720  <br>3 120 000  0.658  78 960  <br>4 120 000  0.572  68 640  <br>5 120 000  0.497  59 640  <br>6 120 000  0.432  51 840  <br>7 120 000  0.376  45 120  <br>Present value of inflows  499 320  <br>Less  initial investment  400 000  <br>NPV 99 320  <br> 239 <br> In the three NPV calculations above, the Navy, the Army and the air force projects have positive NPV. Therefore the three <br>positive NPV projects are acceptable, but Vusi has resources for only one project, hence Vus i would select the air force project <br>with the maximum NPV.  <br>Payback period  <br>  Calculation:  <br>=InvestmentAnnual / cash  inflows  Payback period  <br>Navy  400 000/110 000 3.636 years  <br>Army  400 000/105 000 3.810 years  <br>Air force  (120 000+120  000+120  000+120  000) / 12 × 4 3.4 years  <br> <br>Based on the payback criterion, the air force project offers the shortest payback period, hence Vusi would prefer to proceed <br>with this one. The payback period might serve as an initial proje ct selection process where all shorter period projec ts are <br>selected first before the NPV of such projects is determined. In this case, Vusi might use the payback period to make an init ial <br>selection of air force and Navy projects after which he would use th e NPV to select the air force project given that it has the <br>highest NPV.  <br>Average rate of return (ARR)  <br>  Calculation:  <br>=Average  cash  flow / Initial  investmen t ARR  <br>Navy  Average  cash  flow 110 000 / Initial  investment  400 000 27.5%  <br>Army  105 000 / 400 000 26.25%  <br>Air force  75 714.28 6 / 400 000 18.93%  <br>Based on the ARR decision criterion, Vusi would choose the navy project because it offers the highest ARR.  <br>Note that ARR can also be calculated by using an average investment as the denominator. In this case, the ARR would <br>be doubled, e.g. the navy proj ect would b e: <br>Average  cash  flow 110 000 / Initial  investment  200 000=55% (which is double 27.5%); the decision remains the <br>same whether the average or the initial investment is used as the denominator.  <br>14.4.5 Leverage and breakeven  <br>In the previous sections, it was h ighlighted that the entrepreneur must know the level of production that would <br>result in profit for the business. Here lies the importance of breakeven analysis. The breakeven point is the <br>point or units of production where  all the costs of operations are r ecovered and the profit is zero. This means <br>the level where the sales revenue and costs are equal. This thus implies that the firm might begin to make <br>profit after the breakeven point. Given the importance of profit, it th erefore means that entrepreneurs m ust <br>determine the company’s breakeven point before venturing into production.  <br>Furthermore, the entrepreneur should also know the effect of changes in sales on earnings (operating leverage). <br>The operating leverage of a fir m is derived by dividing the percen tage change in earnings before interest and <br>tax by a percentage change in sales.  <br>An example of a breakeven point is presented for a single -product and a multiple -product entrepreneur. It is <br>now common for businesses to di versify and produce more than one p roduct or offer more than one service.  240 <br> Example of single product breakeven point analysis:  <br>Mlangeni Manufacturing (Pty) Ltd single product data  <br>  Gallic Juice  <br>Anticipated production and sales (units)  6 000  <br>Sales price per unit  R50 <br>Variable cost per unit  R30 <br>Fixed costs  100 000  <br>Required  <br>You are required to determine:  <br>a)  The breakeven point in units  <br>b)  The breakeven point in rand value  <br>c)  The margin of safety and the implication thereof  <br>Then:  <br>d)  Assume the normal sales volume of the company increases  by 20 per cent from the current 6 000 units. Determine the <br>operating leverage if the company’s fixe d costs are R100 000.  <br>Suggested solution  <br>a) Breakeven point in units: BEP in units  <br>Contribution margin  = sales price per unit – variable cost per unit R50 – R30 = <br>R20 <br>BEP in units=Total  fixed  costs / Unit contribution  <br>margi n R100 000 /R20 BEP in units=5 000 units <br>b) Breakeven point in rand value  <br>BEP in rand value =  BEP in units × sales price per unit  <br>BEP in rand value =  5 000 units × R50 = R250 000  <br>c) The margin of safety  <br>The margin of safety ratio <br>= (Anticipated  sales  volum e – breakeven  sales  volum e) / Anticipated  sales  <br>volum e <br>The margin of safety rati o <br>= (6 000 – 5 000) / 6 000=16.667 % <br>Note: margin of safety indicates the percentage with which sales ma y decrease before a loss occurs. In the above case, the <br>margin of safety is very high and is preferred because it will take sales t o decrease by 16.67 per cent before the business will <br>incur a loss. The margin of safety could also be calculated using the s ales values.  241 <br> d) Operating leverage  <br>Operating leverage =  Percentage  change  in EBIT / Percentage  change  in sales  volum e <br>Operating leverage =  <br>  <br>Note:  <br>Variable costs response with <br>the same degree with <br>changes in sales volume    Current sales  20% Sales increase  <br>Sales: 6 000 × R50  300 0 00 360 000  <br>Variable costs (R30 × 6 000)  180 000  216 000  <br>Contribution  120 000  144 000  <br>Less fixed costs  100 000  100 000  <br>EBIT  20 000  44 000  <br> <br>% change in EBIT =  (44 000−20 000) / 20 000=120% <br>Operating leverage =  20% / 1.2%=17 <br>This indicates that a 20 per cent increase in sales would result in EBIT responding to a 17 times increase (as much as on <br>a percentage comparison to sales increase).  <br>Example of multiple product b reakeven point analysis  <br>Mlangeni Manufacturing (Pty) Ltd p roduces three products – Gallic Juice, Butternut Juice and Pear Juice. Having been in <br>business for many years in the city of Johannesburg, profit has been constantly realised as envisaged, and manag ement has <br>not thought it worthwhile to engage in a breakev en analysis of its products. However, a new management accountant, Mr <br>Philip (CA, SA) who took over from Mr Smit who is retiring has frowned on management’s policy of not engaging in a periodic <br>breakeven analysis. He has argued that, although the firm migh t be making profit, it could make even more of a profit if it knew <br>the breakeven ability of individual products, which he said might assist the firm in arriving at the most profitable combinat ion <br>of products.  <br>Presented below is the information for the firs t quarter of 2013:  <br>  Gallic Juice  Butternut Juice  Pear Juice  <br>Anticipated production and sales (units)  6 000  4 000  5 000  <br>Sales price per unit  R50 R30 R40 <br>Variable cost per unit  R30 R15 R22 <br>Alloca ted fixed costs  1 000  600 400 <br>Furthermore there is a common fixed overhead for the first quarter to the amount of R10 000.

Entrepreneurial finance in emerging markets is somewhat distinct from the developed markets <br>especially from the less -developed and/or fu nctiona l supportive institutions, hence entrepreneurial finance in <br>emerging countries is still more dependent on informal sources. The financing problems of entrepreneurs in <br>developing countries draws a cushion from a comparatively low level of capital nee ded to start an <br>entrepreneurial business. The funding environment for entrepreneurs in developing countries is made up of an <br>amalgam of financing choices from business angels, to personal financial bootstrapping to venture funding. <br>After a discussion of ap plicabl e financial planning and sourcing problems, this section also presented basic <br>issues in entrepreneurial finance valuation, such as cost of capital and investment appraisal techniques for the <br>entrepreneur.

This is also applicable to business <br>ventures. This means that entrepreneurial growth should be seen as an indispensable objective  of all <br>organisations since the opposite is undesira ble. Moreover, growth does not happen by accident; it requires <br>premeditated and meticulous acts, which have to be guarded with great vigilance.  <br>In this section, various definitions of entrepreneurial grow th will be considered. This enables you to make <br>sense of what entrepreneurial growth entails. Moreover, attempts have to be made to define what growth in <br>entrepreneurial terms means. Entrepreneurial growth can be defined as an expansion in terms of the <br>organisation’s size, resources, information and experie nce, which emerge as a result of entrepreneurial efforts. <br>This means that the growth cannot happen by accident. However, entrepreneurial efforts are required in order <br>for growth to occur. Wickham (2006) s uggests that all business organisations have the pot ential to grow but <br>none is entitled to such growth. Nieman and Nieuwenhuizen (2014: 295) as well as Crijns and Ooghe (1997: <br>56) outline the characteristics of growth. These can be but are not limited to m arket domination, <br>differentiation, product leadershi p, flexibility innovation, future orientation, export activity and related <br>growth. These characteristics of growth will be briefly explained.  <br>15.1.1 Market domination  <br>Market domination may be measured in terms of the relative market share in the niche mark et. The <br>organisation may have to be a high performer in order to be declared as dominant in the market. However, <br>this may have a negative impact in terms of how some stakeholders such as employees, trade unions and <br>governments perceive the organisation. In  the long run a negative effect is likely to dent the image of the <br>organisation.  248 <br> 15.1.2 Differentiation  <br>An organisation is regarded as a differentiator if it sells something that may be regarded as unique  relative to <br>its competitors. It is essential to not e that this uniqueness is often perceived more than may actually be the <br>case. Some differentiators rely on their product/service packaging and offering. This means consumer <br>behaviour and perception may pl ay a role in consumer buying patterns and loyalty/di sloyalty towards the <br>organisation and its brands.  <br>15.1.3 Product leadership  <br>Growth organisations that are product oriented do have potential to grow through their emphasis on quality, <br>branding and value f or customers. Once more the issues of perceived valu e affect the organisation’s ability to <br>become a leader with regard to a particular product. This notion of perceived value seldom happens overnight. <br>It requires a large amount of investment made on popula rising the organisation and its products in its key <br>markets.  <br>15.1.4 Flexibility  <br>Flexibility indicates the speed and ability to change direction to gain advantage from new opportunities and <br>to counter and/or reduce threats. A rigid organisation is bound to fail given the rapid pace of changes that <br>occur with in the business environment. Such strategic flexibility is a prerequisite for growing organisations <br>as it propels constant analysis and eliminates pockets of complacency.  <br>15.1.5 Innovation  <br>Innovation is a  way of life for growing firms and this is done thro ugh the introduction of technology at a very <br>rapid pace. Innovation has to do with the ability of the organisation to add tangible and intangible value for <br>its customers with the aim of making meaningful and sustainable changes in their lives. Innovation m ust be <br>such that it will enable the organisation to maximise its returns in both the short and the long term.  <br>15.1.6 Orientation towards the future  <br>Greater focus is often given to future projects. Growth -prone organisations invest a great deal of effort, time <br>and other resources in the future.  <br>15.1.7 Export activity  <br>Growth can also be realised by the organisation’s desire to serve the global market. M any growing firms in <br>emerging economies, especially in B RICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) countries, are <br>encouraged to enter the global markets. However, it is to be noted that not all of organisations that enter the <br>global market are actua lly huge. On the contrary, Small, medium and micro enter prises (SMMEs) are <br>beginning to enter the global market. In the pipeline is the establishment of the BRICS Bank, which is set to <br>allow business organisations within the BRICS community to access funds  which may be used to start or grow <br>their businesses.  <br>15.1.8 Related growth  <br>It is believed that growth organisations strive for active, cognisant growth as opposed to uncontrolled growth <br>and this in achieved by utilising opportunities and thereby achieving  the goals they have set. This means that <br>the decision f or an organisation is rather a conscious one, and not merely accidental. A planned series of stages <br>towards a growth trajectory have to take place.  249 <br> 15.2 TYPES OF GROWTH  <br>In the previous  section , growth was defined and explained in terms of what it is and what it may entail. <br>According to the Global Entrepreneurship and Development Index (Ac s & Szerb, 2009), growth can be <br>identified in four ways, namely the newness of the product and of technology; internationalisation; high <br>growth ambitions; and finance among entrepreneurially active in dividuals in a country.  <br>15.2.1 Newness of the product an d of technology  <br>When growth is being pursued, modern organisations may rely heavily on their technological innovation and <br>capabilities. Technology is able to fast -track growth to unprecedented heights . This technology can enable the <br>organisation to provide  relatively competitive products and services to the market. That said, for growth to be <br>realised technology ought to play its part and in order for proper technology to be realised some form of <br>inves tment needs to be in place. Moreover, through the use of  technology, organisations can introduce new <br>ways of producing products and rendering services that are required by the market.  <br>15.2.2 Internationalisation  <br>Internationalisation also refers to globalis ation, which is a strategy upon which an organisation ma y embark. <br>This method of growth is common in large corporates. However, more and more SMMEs, particularly those <br>that are situated within developing economies are pursuing an international trajectory. When pursuing <br>internationalisation, organisations are, h owever, confronted with various challenges, such as foreign laws, tax <br>implications, cultural diversity, climate change, terrorism, pandemics, poverty and social unrest. These <br>aforementioned challenges  have direct and indirect effects on the growth prospect s of organisations.  <br>15.2.3 High growth ambitions  <br>High growth ambitions are in essence strategies and intentions which organisations may employ in order to <br>fast-track growth. The setting of ambitions a nd strategies is the main responsibility of top managers  of the <br>organisation (Lazenby, 2014). The strategies ought to be inspiring and not lacking the necessary incentives <br>for the various key stakeholders. The triple bottom -line approach, which caters for financial growth, social <br>responsibility and environmenta l care must be reflected in the strategic ambitions of growth -prone <br>organisations.  <br>15.2.4 Finance for entrepreneurial activity  <br>A significant amount of money should follow any strategy or growth ambiti on that the organisation seeks to <br>pursue. Access to fina nce in order to finance growth initiatives is an ideal situation that may not always be <br>realisable. Investors are more often than not more likely to back corporate organisations than SMMEs. As <br>such, S MMEs are compelled to produce proposal documents, which are growth friendly and appealing in <br>order to win the hearts of investors.  <br>15.3 STAGES OF GROWTH  <br>Growth emerges at various stages. It is essential to always remember that growth is never constant. Mor eover, <br>an organisation that is not growing is more often  than not on the decline.  250 <br> 15.3.1 Stage 1: Pre -start-up (incubation)  <br>Incubation, or the pre -birth process, means taking all the steps necessary to reach start -up. This is really the <br>entrepreneurial pro cess. The entrepreneur should take note of factors influ encing growth in this pre -birth stage <br>as many decisions made now will be critical at a later stage.  <br>15.3.2 Stage 2: Start -up (infancy)  <br>In the infancy or start -up stage, entrepreneurs may struggle to b reak even as they introduce their new product. <br>In this s tage they are close to their ventures, and can spot obstacles and act quickly to remove them. Growth <br>is relatively slow and thus patience is required.  <br>15.3.3 Stage 3: Breakthrough or growth  <br>In the breakthrough stage, the rate of growth accelerates and reso urces are under major pressure. Growth is <br>quite often so fast that the entrepreneur cannot keep up with it.  <br>15.3.4 Stage 4: Maturity  <br>In this stage, the  entrepreneur must learn to manage time and to delegate. The number of decisions and <br>activities outstrips  the time available, and the entrepreneur must rely increasingly on other people to perform <br>major functions.  <br>15.3.5 Stage 5: Decline/rejuvenation  <br>One o f the criticisms of the life -cycle approach is that it (falsely) suggests that organisational decline is <br>inevitable. It does, however, serve to warn the entrepreneur against complacency as the venture becomes <br>successful.  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 251 <br> Figure 15.1 The stages of venture growt h  <br> <br>15.4 BARRIERS TO ENTREPRENEURIAL GROWTH AND HOW TO MANAGE THEM  <br>Bartlett and Bukvicˇ (2001: 180) s uggest that there are several barriers to growth, which business organisations <br>ought to guard against. These barriers include the following: institutional barriers (including the legislative <br>framework, and the degree of co rruption and bribery a firm encoun ters); barriers due to the external market <br>position of a firm (the sector in which the firm operates, the degree of competition, whether a firm is facing <br>strategic behaviour by competitors, the extent of network alliances to support growth); financial barr iers <br>(including the availability and cost of capital and finance); internal organisational barriers (including <br>managerial capacity and capability, the objectives of the firm, principal -agent difficulties; skills), and soci al <br>barriers (to do with the suppor t, or lack of it, from local actors and agencies). These barriers are discussed <br>below.  <br>15.4.1 Institutional barriers  <br>These barriers emerge from formalised bureaucratic arrangements, which are often government regulations <br>that dictate how SMMEs may interact  with their stakeholders. The laws of the country provide institutional <br>frameworks within which SMMEs may interact with their customers, government and each other.  <br>This has a profound influence on the economic performance and subsequently entrepreneurial g rowth of such <br>an SMME. This challenge is also realised in developed economies, such as those in both West and East <br>European economies even though institutional barriers are regarded as a high -risk factor for economic <br>devel opment.  <br>252 <br> 15.4.2 Barriers internal t o the firm  <br>Human resources management and labour -related restrictions as well as conditions of employment may serve <br>as some key internal barriers. There is a limit to hiring fixed -term labour. In addition, issues such as l ay-offs <br>and the dismissal of the l ess productive workers may frustrate the growth potential of an organisation. More <br>often than not the owner -manager struggles to diversify control over business functions to professional <br>managers and this can be regarded a s a key internal constraint on the  growth of SMME (Storey, 1994).  <br>The degree of competition in the market and  the sector of activity constitute a core determinant of external <br>barriers. The growth of organisations may be hampered by factors such as: low dem and for the product; access <br>to raw  materials; difficulties in exporting; public procurement rules; and in some instances the late payment <br>of bills by business customers.  <br>15.4.3 Financial barriers  <br>Several financial barriers may affect SMMEs, some of which are: the high cost of credit; a lac k of venture <br>capital; bank charges and fees; and high collateral requirements. These challenges could serve as indictments <br>on the part of financial services provi ders given their reluctance to offer packages that are SMME friendly. <br>These result in credit c onstraints, which subsequently affect the growth agenda of SMMEs in both the short <br>and long run. As such, the underdeveloped capital market often forces SMMEs to rely on self -financing or <br>borrowing from friends, which is often their last resort (Pissarides , 1998).  <br>15.4.4 Social barriers  <br>Trust issues among business partners play a significant role in building or dismantling the social barriers of <br>business. Trust can  easily be broken and may take a long time before it is fully established. Moreover, trust is <br>subject to beliefs, culture and social status, which affect how business partners perceive one another. There <br>could be instances where trust has to be placed on a nonymous trading partners or on casual acquaintances in <br>the absence of open networks. As such,  an institutional support network is needed in order to address the <br>issues, which may raise barriers to growth.  <br>15.5 DEALING WITH THE BARRIERS TO ENTREPRENEURIAL GROWTH  <br>Richter (2013: 457) argues that there are several fundamental principles that an organi sation must pursue in <br>order to overcome barriers to growth.  <br>• Value proposition:  refers to the bundle of products and services that creates value for the customer a nd <br>allows the company to earn revenue  <br>• Customer interface:  comprises the overall interaction wi th the customer; it consists of customer <br>relationship, customer segments and distribution channels  <br>• Infrastructure:  describes the architecture of the company’s val ue-creation process; it includes assets, know -<br>how and partnerships  <br>• Revenue model:  represents t he relationship between costs to produce the value proposition and the <br>revenues that are generated by offering the value proposition to customers  <br>• Strategy:  the wo rd “strategy” has been used loosely in recent times. As such the meaning thereof has been <br>diluted. Sometimes people refer to a mere idea, a short -term wish or a temporary tactic as strategy and <br>this can never be the case. It is therefore imperative to defi ne what strategy really is. In actual fact, <br>strategy originates from a Greek word “strategeo”,  which means military commander (Lazenby, 2014: 3). <br>As such, “strategy” has a military background (Louw & Venter, 2013). Moreover, strategy can be regarded <br>as a w ell-calculated “game plan”, which the organisation can put together in order to achieve its <br>objectives. It is thus safe to say that strategy is a derived activity (a means to an end and not an end in <br>itself), which seeks to enable the organisation to achie ve its objectives. This means that strategy does not 253 <br> exist for its own sake, but with the ques t of realising the objectives in mind. As introduced earlier in this <br>section of this chapter, strategy has to do with planning; hence some authors refer to strate gic planning.  <br>15.6 STRATEGIC PLANNING  <br>Miller and Cardinal (1994) view strategic planning as st andardised planning guidelines or written plans, which <br>the organisation can pursue to realise its objectives. Louw and Venter (2013) regard strategic planning as the <br>means to achieve an agreed view of how the enterprise will succeed in the future. Lazenby (2014: 6) credits <br>strategic planning for its ability to expose hidden opportunities and unseen solutions. In summary, strategic <br>planning has to with how an organi sation organises its limited resources to respond to the needs from its <br>environment and stakeh olders, with particular emphasis on customers’ demands. Strategic planning is also <br>referred to as the thinking stage, as this is where ideas are generated and con ceptualised.  <br>15.7 ENTREPRENEURIAL GROWTH STRATEGIES  <br>Growth cannot occur without effort. This e ffort includes an organisation putting strategies in place. It follows <br>that there are various strategies that an organisation can employ. In broad terms organisat ions can employ <br>internal and/or external growth strategies.  <br>15.7.1 Internal growth strategies  <br>These strategies are also known as organic growth strategies, since they represent the growth from within. At <br>the heart of these strategies is innovation, researc h and development. At least three internal growth strategies <br>may be found, which are concentra ted growth, product/service development and market development.  <br>Figure 15.2 Internal growth strategies  <br> <br>15.7.1.1 Concentrated growth  <br>This strategy relates to the concentrated marketing efforts that the organisation may undertake in its quest for <br>expansion  and growth. As such, concentrated growth is also known as market penetration. In this instance, the <br>organisation focuses on meeting t he expectations of its consumers relatively better than its rivals. Intensive <br>marketing campaigns often characterise this strategy.  <br>254 <br> 15.7.1.2 Product/service development  <br>Product/service development is employed through the considerable modification of the or ganisation’s current <br>products and/or services with the view to satisfying the existing consumers’ needs. This means that t he <br>organisation seeks to retain its exiting consumers by seeking to improve its product/service offering. This also <br>requires intensive  research, and, based on the results of this research, market -relevant products and services <br>may be rolled out.  <br>15.7.1.3 M arket development  <br>Market development involves the expansion of the organisation’s products and/or services to other <br>geographical areas  that were not traditionally served by the organisation. In this instance, the organisation <br>retains its product/service of fering but is compelled to move out of its comfort zone in its endeavour to expand <br>and grow its market base.  <br>15.7.2 External growth st rategies  <br>External growth strategies are put in place when the organisation seeks to enhance its competitiveness by <br>collabo rating with distributors/retailers, suppliers or competitors. Inevitably, hard decisions need to be made <br>that are in the best interest s of those involved. External growth strategies can either occur in a horizontal or <br>vertical manner. Furthermore, three ex ternal growth strategies are commonly known: horizontal integration; <br>forward -vertical integration; and backward -vertical integration. These strategies are illustrated in  Figure 15.3 . <br>Figure 15.3 Integrat ion strategies  <br> <br> <br>Sources:  Adapted from Lazenby (2014: 185); Ehlers & Lazenby (2010: 209)  <br> <br>Figure 15.3  suggests how and who is involved in the integration strategies of an organisation. This m eans the <br>key stakeholders of the organisation are identified and their roles defined.  <br>255 <br> 15.7.2.1 Horizontal integration  <br>Something that is horizontal is at the same level  as something else. As such, when an organisation follows a <br>horizontal integration, it do es this in order to take over and thereby eliminate its competitors. The business <br>space of competitors is often “suffocated” and reduced so as to render them irrelevan t and demoralised. Only <br>then can an offer be tabled to buy the competitor out of business . <br>Extract  <br>Physician markets  <br>Horizontal integration occurs when individual physicians join group practices, or existing groups merge with each other. <br>There are numerous theoretical reasons to expect that this type of integration might lead to improved quali ty and cost <br>savings, includi ng enhanced operating efficiency and economies of scale. When groups consist of physicians across <br>multiple specialties, there may also be gains from economies of scope, including improved coordination and quality of <br>patient care , in-house or within -network  referrals, and the capture of high -revenue services, such as outpatient surgeries <br>and imaging services.  <br>Source:  http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2014/04/25/the -way-forward -for-integrated -care-what -weve -learned -from-horizontal -and-vertical -integration -of-<br>physicians/  <br> <br> <br>Horizontal integration can thu s be regarded as lateral integr ation. This is when two competitors come together <br>to form one formidable organisation. Their resources, technology and expertise are put together so as to take <br>advantage of their strengths and eliminate weaknesses.  <br>It should be noted, however, that this ty pe of integration is prone to challenges including: personality clashes; <br>conflicting views and ideologies as well as cultural mismatch between the two organisations that are seeking <br>to come together. As such, patience, commun ication and trust building can go a long way toward addressing <br>these challenges.  <br>15.7.2.2 Forward -vertical integration  <br>When wanting to take over its distributors or retailers, the organisation may employ forward -vertical <br>integration as a strategy of choice . Distributors and retailers of ten have access to a greater market pool, and as <br>such, have to maximise profits and returns at the expense of the organisation’s products, services, reputation <br>and brand. Therefore the taking over of distributors or retailers  may present the organisation w ith an <br>opportunity to increase its monetary and other returns and thereby widen its market base.  <br>Extract  <br>As an example of forward integration, News Corporation purchased DirectTV through acquisition. DirectTV was a satellite <br>TV company, and its purchase en abled News Corporation to use it as a medium to distribute more of its news, movies and <br>television shows by managing the process itself.  <br>Source:  http://smallbusiness.chron.com/example -companys -forward -integration -37601.html  <br> <br> 256 <br> Extract  <br>American Apparel (AA) is a classic example of a company that employs forward integration by controlling every aspect of <br>the distribution of  its products. AA manages every fo rm of distribution in -house, including the high -rent, high -profile retail <br>stores, its wholesale operation selling clothing, its screen printers and boutiques, and the online store that sells througho ut <br>the United States an d internationally.  <br>Warehousing and  distribution is also managed internally from the company’s Los Angeles factory.  <br>Source:  http://smallbusiness.chron. com/example -companys -forward -integration -37601.html  <br> <br> <br>Forward -vertical integration is one way of rapid expansion that the business organisation may consider. The pros and cons <br>thereof have to be thoroughly investigated as these may have unintended conseq uences to the growth prospects and th e <br>long-term survival of the organisation.  <br>It follows that retailers and distributors are not the only stakeholders that the organisation may turn to, since <br>backward -vertical integration is another alternative.  <br>15.7.2.3 Backward -vertical integration  <br>Backwar d-vertical integration is employed when the organisation seeks to take over its suppliers. This strategy <br>may only be employed if it makes business sense to do so. The organisation ought to consider the cost of long -<br>term aspects of the business, which were originally assigned to the designated supplier before a takeover <br>happens. This requires rigorous research of the supplier and the supplier’s suppliers.  <br>Extract  <br>A cheese -making company, Gouda Fresh, decided to take over a dairy farm, which used to supply it with milk. By so doing, <br>Gouda Fresh got direct access to its raw materials in the form of milk. Moreover, Gouda Fresh took control of its supply -<br>chain processe s and as a result managed to lower the cost of accessing it s ingredients.  <br>Source:  http://xplaind.com/339290/backward -integration  <br> <br> <br>Extract  <br>In another instance, if Apple Incorporated (electronics company) integrates with Intel, it will be a  backward integration. Apple <br>is a manufacturer of computers and falls at a later stage in the supply chain while Intel is a supplier of processors and fal ls <br>earlier in the supply chain. From the definition we follow that acquisition of a supplier by a manu facturer is backward <br>integration.  <br>Source:  http://xplaind.com/339290/backward -integration  <br> <br> <br>When the business organisation is able to take control of its supply -chain process it can  have a competitive <br>advantage over its competitors in terms of the costs of production as well as quality issues. However, the <br>business organisation should avo id falling into the trap of having to deal with hidden costs and other realities, <br>which may only emerge after the takeover of a supplier has occurred.  257 <br> 15.8 CONCLUSION  <br>In this chapter, organisational growth, its ingredients and pitfalls were considered. Str ategic management was <br>seen as one of the powerful tools, on which organisation can rely in terms not only of survival, but also growth, <br>sustainability and profitability. It was discussed that growing the organisation can never happen by accident, <br>automatic ally or without effort from those at the helm of the organisation. Moreover, growth is seen as a <br>necessary good for any modern organisation especially those located within developing countries, for example <br>members of the BRICS community. This is significan t in that the BRICS members constitute some of the <br>countries, which are considered to be emerging  economies.  <br>REVIEW QUESTIONS  <br>15.1 Define what entrepreneurial growth entails.  <br>15.2 Discuss the stages of entrepreneurial growth.  <br>15.3 Discuss the barriers to e ntrepreneurial growth.  <br>15.4 Explain the four ways in which the barriers to entrepreneurial growth  may be overcome.  <br>15.5 Discuss the various internal entrepreneurial growth strategies.  <br>15.6 Discuss the various external entrepreneurial growth strategies.  <br>REFERENCES  <br>Acs, Z.J. & Szerb, L. 2009.

Stelios Nathanael, CEO of Chesa Nyama <br>and COO of Gold Brand s Investments explained that the listing, through which the company was able to raise R25 million, <br>would be used primarily for  the expansion of its flagship franchise. Their expansion strategy has seen the traditional flame -<br>grilled meat franchise become on e of South Africa’s fastest growing national brands with almost 300 franchises across South <br>Africa and employing over 3000 peo ple. Gold Brands followed their listing on the JSE’s AltX market with news that they would <br>be taking the Chesa Nyama brand to the US. <br>Hughes says business owners should keep in mind that once the bu siness is listed, it is in a regulated environment where <br>certain disclosures need to be made, your share price is traded and people understand the market value of your shares.  <br>“People are able to do better evaluation of your company because of the financia l information that is disclosed. You have other <br>governance  matters, which you need to comply with in order to remain listed, so being listed should make your company in <br>many respects more attractive to investors because of the requirements for listing and to maintain a listing.”  <br>“Once you are listed, your stakeho lders, from a shareholders’ and from a regulators’ perspective, all change. So once you list, <br>your shareholder base obviously chan ges. Your stakeholders now include other institutional investors, ot her regulators that <br>may not have been part of your busines s prior to the listing,” Hughes says.  <br>Source:  Adapted from  http://www.goldbrands.co.za/News/default.aspx?pjID=3  <br>16.1 INTRODUCTION  <br>Enterprise development (ED) is a phenomenon t hat many emerging economies adopted in order to foster <br>economic growth. The spirit of enterprise development is embodied in the growth of small and medium -sized <br>businesses (SMEs) through the provisi on of finance  and non -financial support in order for them to graduate <br>and become big participants in the economic space. This support can help overcome obstacles, and increase <br>competitiveness in the market, with the end result being job creation and povert y alleviation . Enterprise -<br>development programmes aim to pa ss on knowledge, experience and business support. This aim will provide 260 <br> start-ups with the essential tools and resources that can then be used for the development, survival and success <br>of a business . <br>16.1.1 Defi nition of enterprise development  <br>Enterprise d evelopment is defined as activities undertaken by government, the private sector, an enterprise -development <br>organisation, a private consultant and/or a combination of two or more to assist or accele rate the deve lopment, sustainability <br>and ultimately financ ial independence of the programme beneficiary. The process is ultimately followed by business growth <br>as measured by its financial and competitive position in the market.  <br>ED is further defined by Rai zcorp (2011) as investing time, knowledge and capital to h elp SMEs to establish, <br>expand or improve businesses, including empowering modest incomegenerating informal activities to grow <br>and contribute to the local economy.  <br>16.1.2 The concept of enterprise de velopment  <br>Enterprise development has become imperative and  an important part of South African business (in both <br>government and the private sector). With ED, the general population can potentially earn a living and <br>miraculously turn from job seekers to job creators in t he ecosystem. Over a period of time, these pe ople turn <br>into entrepreneurs and create jobs, making meaningful contributions to the communities in which they live <br>and do business. ED encompasses finance, entrepreneurial development, investment i n small, medi um and <br>micro enterprises (SMMEs), including i nitiatives that range from enabling the start -up of small businesses, to <br>providing business skills to existing enterprises through training and mentorship. ED requires one to <br>understand where the bu siness is and  determine the strategies required at each st age of the business. Therefore, <br>the next item focuses on the business life cycle for entrepreneurs to keep track of, and apply, the appropriate <br>strategies for each stage.  <br>16.1.3 The life cycle of an  enterprise  <br>The life cycle of an enterprise is similar to that of a human being and a product. A product progresses through <br>a sequence of stages from birth to growth, maturity, and decline and then death or until it is revitalised with <br>new features and sha pe. This sequ ence of stages is known as the product life c ycle and is associated with <br>changes in the marketing approach applied by the enterprise, thus influencing the whole marketing strategy of <br>the business over time. Similarly so, the business life cycl e usually inc ludes its birth or incorporation stage, <br>its initial growth stage, its expansion stage as it moves into new markets, its mature operation stage, and its <br>eventual decline as consumer interest in its products slow down and key employees and other  stakeholders  <br>depart. The reason these stages constitute a  life cycle is that in the entrepreneurial world, we’ll often do things <br>that change our position and start the cycle afresh. Each of the stages is accompanied by costs, risks and <br>opportunities that the enterpris e needs to respond to through a series of str ategies, which are discussed after <br>each phase.  <br>16.1.3.1 Start -up/entry phase  <br>In this phase, the entrepreneur decides on a start -up and actively looks for a market and offers. The <br>entrepreneur might have no custo mers or market during this phase but decides not to sit on the fence any <br>longer and become an entrepreneur.  <br>Strategies to deal with the challenges  <br>• Begin preparations for any potential cash problem with some savings.  <br>• Build a good credit profile . <br>• Develop agg ressive marketing strategies to capture the m arkets.  <br>• Attend entrepreneurial and other relevant courses to develop the management skills needed.  <br>• Do some research on recent legislation that may affect the business.  <br> 261 <br> Figure 16.1 The business lif e cycle  <br>  <br>16.1.3.2 Acceleration/growth phase  <br>The growth s tage is characterised by a rapid increase in sales. This is as a result of market awareness of the <br>enterprise and its products. This phase requires careful management to respond to a number of chall enges. <br>The rapid increase in sales puts a lot of pressure on the enterprise’s existing resources. The entrepreneur is <br>constantly on call to respond to customers’ needs. At this stage, it is best for the entrepreneur to default o n <br>personal needs when decidi ng on the business’s needs in order to support this phase.  <br>Strategies to deal with the challenges  <br>• Work hard.  <br>• Update the credit policy to maximise the collection of debts more efficiently.  <br>• If needs be, consider factoring to meet the immediate cash needs.  <br>• Employ professional managers when needed.  <br>16.1.3.3 Maturity phase  <br>During this stage, growth in sales begins to leveloff. The business has reached stagnation and continues to sell <br>the same products year after year and possibly at the same price because the ma rket is already saturated. A <br>classic example would be with  the sale of a LED television set. It is a durable product and once everyone who <br>needed one has acquired one, there is little demand. The only time sales become possible is when people are <br>forced to  replace the one they have due to theft or any unforeseen circumstance. Businesses that lack creativity <br>and i nnovation at this stage should think of new ways to grow the value of their business. The need for <br>corporate entrepreneurship arises, as is the cas e in many businesses in today’s commercial environment.  <br>Strategies to deal with the challenges  <br>• Look for ways to cut the costs of doing business.  <br>• Pay attention to everything in the value chain to reduce costs.  <br>• Apply either both related and/or unrelated dive rsification strategies, if required.  <br>• Look for alternative ways to increase the value of the enterprise.  <br>• Emplo y qualified and capable managers to run the business.  <br>• Should the need arise, sell the business and exit.  <br>262 <br> 16.1.3.4 Decline/slow -down phase  <br>This stag e is critical in the life cycle of an enterprise. An enter prise will begin to see some warning signs <br>before the eventual collapse. A quick  and strategic response should become a priority for the CEO or the <br>responsible executive to save the busines s. Ideall y, it means the business has failed to respond to increase d <br>competition and starts showing some signs of decline in sales and a potential loss of market share. In most <br>cases, the business has reached a stage where it becomes unprofitable and cash flow beco mes a serious <br>problem. Unless urgent life -saving action is  taken, the business is likely to fail.  <br>Strategies to deal with the challenges  <br>• Improve the competitive position of the business through cost -cutting measures.  <br>• Use corporate entrepreneurship  to reviv e the organisation by introducing new ventures.  <br>• Appoint a new management team with fresh ideas.  <br>• As a final option, effective and ethical management of the exit to try to maximise the benefits.  <br>16.1.3.5 Death/disappearance phase  <br>This stage is not i deal for any business. However, we have seen many enterprises like Kodak slowly <br>disappearing. The most common reasons for businesses to reach this stage include the following factors:  <br>• Negligence:  this occurs when managers or the entrepreneurs themselves do  not pay adequate attention to <br>their own business. They become too busy “working in” the business rather than “working on” it.  <br>a)  Working in your business simply means doing business.  <br>b)  Working on your business is an act of building a business.  <br>• Lack of experienc e: this is regarded as one of the best teachers in life, y et this does not necessarily always <br>have to be our own experience. Leveraging on others’ expertise can prove to be a beneficial exercise for <br>the enterprise. It is for this reason that smart  entrepre neurs always surround themselves with experts, <br>consultants , coaches and other professionals who are generally smarter than they are with regard to the <br>critical areas of their business.  <br>• Greed:  it has always been said that any attempt to bite off mo re than o ne can chew is a sure -fire way to kill <br>the business.  <br>Strat egies to deal with the challenges  <br>Companies do not move to more organic structures until they face the problems of increased costs and reduced <br>quality. Many large companies downsize before adopting organic structures. Greiner’s model suggests that <br>organisa tions grow through collaboration until a new, unknown crisis arises. Other strategies include: <br>rebranding; selling off unprofitable business units; rehiring with new performance contracts; selling o ff some <br>of the fixed assets; reducing operational expenses  and seeking strategic alliances.  <br>The success of SMEs in any economy largely depends on the ecosystems and the support structures brought <br>to them by the authorities. It is therefore imperat ive that this chapter pays attention to the SME environments <br>of dif ferent emerging economies.  263 <br> 16.2 THE SME ENVIRONMENT IN EMERGING ECONOMIES (BRAZIL, INDIA, CHINA AND <br>SOUTH AFRICA)  <br>16.2.1 Introduction  <br>The explosion of entrepreneurship in both India and Brazil is ta king place notwithstanding the high levels of <br>red tape tha t businesses in these two countries still face when starting up. For instance, according to rankings <br>from the  World Bank’s Doing Busin ess 2011  report, Brazil ranks 127th and India at 134th on the ea se of doing <br>business, while South Africa was ranked far hi gher at 34th out of 183 countries, as shown in  Table 16.1 . <br>16.2.1.1 Why Brazi l and India?  <br>While the populations and land areas in Brazil and India are far larger than those in South Africa, the three <br>economies h ave a lot of similarities in that they are grappling with simila r developmental issues. These include <br>poor educational qua lity; a lack of enabling infrastructure; and a low share of international trade. <br>Furthermore,  they all form part of the India, Brazil,  South Africa (IBSA) initiative. This was established in <br>2003 wi th the aim of creating a platform to share information reg arding economic developments, technologies <br>and skills to complement each other’s strengths; and they ultimately form part of the BRICS  economy (Brazil, <br>Russia, India, China and South Africa). Nevert heless, Brazil is particularly similar to South Africa in that the <br>two countries are among the most unequal in the world. There is therefore a case for contrasting South Africa <br>with Brazil and  India. One reason to look to India and Brazil rather than at th e Newly Industrialising <br>Economies (NIE) of Southeast Asia as many developmental economists are prone to do is that the NIE model <br>is not directly comparable to the policy context of South Afric a. In contrast, China’s economy is bigger than <br>the other three c ombined and therefore its stage of development is far ahea d and equally so is Russia. This <br>justifies the exclusion of these two countries despite being part of the BRICS economy.  <br>16.2.2 Small -business policies in South Africa, India and Brazil  <br>16.2.2.1 Sou th Africa  <br>According to Timm (2011), small -business policie s in South Africa have not done much to create effective <br>agencies to help support business owners to start up and grow their businesse s. Added to this, an awareness <br>of many of the government’s suppo rt schemes has also been very low. The Department of Small  Business <br>Development (DSBD) is currently hosting a national stakeholder consultation session on the review of the <br>National Small Busi ness Act 102 of 1996 in order to improve the regulatory environm ent for SMMEs in South <br>Africa. The regulatory framework is  not only a South African challenge but also one facing many emerging <br>economies.  <br>16.2.2.2 India  <br>On 9 May 2007, subsequent to an amendm ent of the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, <br>1961, the erstwhile Ministry of Small -Scale Industries and the Ministry of Agro and Rural Industries were <br>merged to form the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (M/o MSME). This min istry designs <br>policies and promotes/facilitates programmes, proj ects and schemes and monitors their implementation with <br>a view to assisting MSMEs and help them to scale up. The primary responsibility of the promotion and <br>development of MSMEs is the state g overnments.  <br>The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act was ratified in 2006 to address policy <br>issues affecting MSMEs as well as the coverage and investment ceiling of the sector (MSME, 2016). The Act <br>seeks to facilitate the development  of these enterprises and also enhance their competitiveness. It  provides the <br>first ever legal framework for recognition o f the concept of “enterprise”, which comprises both manufacturing <br>and service entities.  264 <br> 16.2.2.3 Brazil  <br>According to Timm (2011), this  sector is fairly well developed in Brazil and the policies and institutional <br>framework are aimed at further developing an d strengthening SMEs to contribute further to job creation, <br>innovation and inter -industry linkages. Schlemm (1999) has noted that the number of SMEs in Brazil is not <br>only large but also growing. Apa rt from policies in support of SMEs, there is strong coope ration between <br>research institutes/universities and Brazilian industries including the SME subsector (Meneghel, Mello, <br>Gomes & Brisoll a, 2004). The Brazilian government’s policy on small businesses is contained principally in <br>Lei Geral, a law passed in 200 6, which has simplified taxes for small and micro firms and boosted government <br>procurement, among other things.  <br>Most of Brazil’s suppo rt for small business falls under its small business support age ncy SEBRAE, the <br>Ministry of Development, Industry and Comm erce (MDIC), as well as under its development finance <br>institution BNDES and state banks.  <br>16.3 SMALL -BUSINESS SUPPORT  <br>16.3.1 South Africa  <br>Despite numerous initiatives over the last 15 years aimed at both high -end enterprise development and the <br>encouragement  of micro enterprises, government -support agencies and initiatives “have been less successful <br>than intended” (Timm, 2 011). As small businesses in South  Africa (as in other emerging economies) are <br>recognised as a driving force for economic growth and the cr eation of jobs, enterprise -development <br>programmes offered by government and corporates offer black entrepreneurs the opportunity to find support <br>and training to further develop their small businesse s. In South Africa government -sponsored initiatives to <br>support entrepreneurship are administered under the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of <br>Small Busines s Development. Key institutions with national footprints include the following:  <br>• Small Enterprise Development Agency (SEDA):  provides non -financial, business advisory services and <br>technical support to SMMEs in South Africa.  <br>• Small Enterprise Finance Agency ( SEFA):  provides a range of funding in the form of direct loans ranging from <br>R500 to R5 million for SMMEs in South Africa.  <br>• South African Bur eau of Standards (SABS):  supports entrepreneurs to access conformity assessment <br>services of the SABS during the proce ss of developing their innovations. Where there are no standards, <br>they facilitate  the establishment of such standards together with the ind ustry role players. According to <br>Moeng (2012), conformance to standards is a key challenge facing inspired young entr epreneurs in South <br>Africa. The SABS has been established through an Act of parlia ment and is the only institution established <br>specifically to promote quality assurance by developing, promoting, certifying and maintaining standards <br>in South Africa.  <br>• National  Empowerment Fund (NEF):  assists growing businesses with capital -raising services  to support them <br>in their growth stage. The NEF’s funding ranges from R250 000 to a maximum of R20 million with an <br>investment horizon of five to seven years.  <br>• National Youth De velopment Agency (NYDA):  previously operated as the Umsobomvu Youth Fund. The <br>NYD A was established in 2008 to help deal with the challenges  facing the youth in South Africa that lead <br>to their high levels of unemployment. The entity provides grants in the f orm of both financial and non -<br>financial support to youth entrepreneurs starting f rom R1 000 to a maximum of R100 000. Non -financial <br>support  includes mentorship programmes, market linkages, entrepreneurship development programmes, <br>youth cooperative developm ent programmes, and other business support services relevant to the youth.  <br>Furthe rmore, there are a number of parastatals that also support  small businesses, though mainly at the upper <br>end of the spectrum. A parastatal is a state -owned organisation that op erates separately from the government, <br>but whose activities serve the state, eith er directly or indirectly. These include the following:  265 <br> • Independent Development Corporation (IDC):  provides funding for various industrial development <br>programmes.  <br>• Council for Science and Industrial Research (CSIR):  offers support with product improvement a nd <br>manufacturing assistance to SMMEs through their Nationa l Manufacturing Centre.  <br>• Riversands Incubation Hub:  the hub is located north of Fourways in Johannesburg. Riversands h as custom -<br>designed premises, self -directed training and coaching, as well as grea t market access to incubate SMMEs.  <br>Private initiatives inc lude, among others, business partners and commercial banks, and will be discussed later <br>in the chapter.  <br>16.3.2 India  <br>One sector that has emerged as highly vibrant and dynamic in the Indian economy o ver the last five decades <br>are the MSMEs. According to the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (2008), the MSME in <br>India has two divisions called the Small and Medi um Enterprises (SME) division and the Agro and Rural <br>Industry (ARI) Division. The  ministry clarified that part of the SME division’s role i s administration, vigilance <br>and administrative supervision of the National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC) Ltd, a  public -sector <br>enterprise, and the three autonomous national -level entrepreneursh ip development/training originations. The <br>ARI Division is responsible for the administration of two statutory bodies, viz the Khadi and Village Industries <br>Commission (KVIC), C oir Board and a newly created organisation called Mahatma Gandhi  Institute for Ru ral <br>Industrialization (MGIRI). It is also responsible for the supervision of the Prime Minister’s Employment <br>Generation Programme (PMEGP).  <br>Khadi and Village Industries Commiss ion <br>The Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC), established under the Kha di and Village Industries <br>Commission Act 61 of 1956, is a statutory organisation engaged in promoting and developing khadi and <br>village industries to provide employment opportu nities in rural areas, thereby strengthening the rural economy <br>(MSME, 2008).  <br>National Small Industries Corporation Limited (NSIC)  <br>The prima ry responsibility of the corporation is to promote, support and foster the growth of micro and small <br>enterprises in the country on a general commercial basis. NSIC provides a variety of support serv ices to micro <br>and small enterprises catering to t heir diff erent requirements in the areas of: raw -material procurement; <br>product marketing; credit rating; acquisition of technologies; and adoption of modern management practices.  <br>16.3.3 Brazil  <br>According to W hite (2005), part of the success of the SME strat egy in Br azil was that it both defined and <br>categorised its SMEs. To date, SMEs represent a large sector of the Brazilian economy. The creation of <br>SEBRAE in Brazil illustrates how the Brazilian government hel ped bring small business into the mainstream <br>by fostering a “self -help” attitude in entrepreneurs. SEBRAE offers a large number of courses and seminars <br>that help to train entrepreneurs in Brazil. It also stresses the importance of maintaining both the flow  of <br>information and of intellectual growth.  <br>SEBRA E is a de velopment agency in Brazil offering the following services to SMEs:  <br>• The promotion of a more productive and competitive environment  <br>• Entrepreneurship education – from primary education up to the unive rsity level. This happens in companies <br>via elearn ing and i n many educational institutions through the offer of specific content  <br>• Business linkages, which support and mediates the creation of business linkages between small and large <br>companies  <br>• Capacity build ing, which opens new and important markets to sma ll enterp rises that want to supply big <br>demands, leveraging the productivity and competitiveness of all  266 <br> SEBRAE has developed a partnership with the national component manufacturers’ association, Sindipecas, <br>with the aim of combining the resources of both or ganisatio ns to develop the auto -component sector into a <br>cluster that is highly competitive by international standards. Another area where SEBRAE has made some <br>progress is in technology, in particular ecommer ce support for SMEs. Providing technical assistan ce and <br>ecommerce training to SMEs helps to improve their capabilities and operational progress (Timm, 2011).  <br>16.3.4 Comparison  <br>A table of comparison between India, Brazil and South Africa is detailed in  Table 16.1 . <br>Table 16.1 Ranking on doing business in India, Brazil and South Afric a (2006, 2009; 2010)  <br>  Brazil  India  South Africa  <br>Overall (2010)  127 134 34 <br>Starting up (2010)  128 165 75 <br>Procedures to start up (2009)  15 12 6 <br>Procedures to start up (2006)  18 13 8 <br>Time in days (2006)  152 33 31 <br>Employing workers (2009)  138 104 102 <br>Getting credit (2010)  89 32 2 <br>Closing a business (2010)  132 134 74 <br>Sources:  Data for 2010 from World Bank (2011); data for 2006 from World Bank (2007)  <br> <br>In Brazil, entrepreneurs face mountains of red tape; uncertainty over constantly changing regulations; and <br>difficult regulations, for example on setting up new b usinesses, on employment and working overtime, and <br>on minimum wages. Starting a business takes about 16 procedures, which is more than double the six steps <br>required in South Africa and more than the  13 required in India. It can take almost six times longer  to start a <br>business in Brazil (120 days) than it does in South Africa, and four times longer t han the average 30 days <br>needed in India. Yet despite this, Brazil still produces entrepreneurs at a rat e of almost double that of South <br>Africa, according to the 2009  Global Enterprise Monitor Report . According to Timm (2011), all three <br>countries have simil ar levels of infrastructure development. Both Brazil and South Africa suffer from high <br>crime rates, a p oor quality of education, restrictive hiring and firing pr actices and similar high levels of market <br>dominance by large firms, while India and South Afric a share similar levels of access to finance and similar <br>spending on research and development. Neverthel ess, despite South Africa being an easier place to start u p a <br>business according to the World Bank Survey, the country’s favourable business climate is u ndone by the <br>disastrous consequences of apartheid (1948 –1994).  267 <br> 16.4 PROMOTION OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP BY GO VERNMENTS  <br>Presently, the SEDA is one of the major public a gencies in South Africa that provides non -financial, business -<br>advisory services to SMEs. The Brazilian government, together with the private sector and various institutions, <br>has developed an SME bod y (SEBRAE)  to oversee and represent the growing SME sector  and add structure <br>and regulation to these enterprises. This organisation has been central to Brazil’s successful SME campaign. <br>India has developed the Khadi and Village Industries Commission and th e National  Small Industries <br>Corporation Limited (NSIC) (Ti mm, 2011) to assist its small businesses. The development of SMEs has <br>become a national imperative among many governments in emerging economies. Many government <br>departments have specific strategies in place, for example, developing SMEs in the tourism sect or, or <br>developing small -and-emerging contractors by Housing and Public Works, Land and Agriculture, Arts and <br>Culture and so forth. As part of the National Skills Development Strategy in South Africa , the Sect or <br>Education and Training Authorities (SETAs) ar e also supposed to develop programmes that help grow small <br>businesses in their respective sectors.  <br>16.4.1 Financial support  <br>According to small -business researchers SBP, despite numerous initiatives over the l ast 15 years aimed at <br>both high -end enterprise d evelopment and the encouragement of micro enterprises, government -support <br>agencies and initiatives “have been less successful than intended”. According to Heemskerk (2005), formal <br>financial intermed iaries, su ch as commercial banks, are not willing to serve  poor households and micro <br>enterprises because of: the high cost of small transactions; lack of traditional collateral; lack of basic <br>requirements for financing; and geographic isolation. By doing s o, these i nstitutions ignore the enormous <br>potential in tal ents and entrepreneurship of this stratum of society. Providing access to financial services will <br>stimulate the independence and self -development of poor households and micro entrepreneurs. In recen t years, <br>two major trends have drawn attention to the pote ntial market opportunity associated with low -income <br>individuals and small businesses in particular. Widespread publicity around the United Nation’s international <br>year of micro credit in 2005 and Muh ammad Yunu s’s Nobel Peace Price in 2006 have increased ove rall public <br>awareness of micro finance (Sutton & Jenkins, 2007).  <br>16.4.1.1 Financial support to SMEs  <br>The problem of limited access to loan finance has been identified repeatedly by the governments of  developin g <br>economies as the top impediment to business. O ne reason why SMEs in historically disadvantaged areas are <br>still unable to access funding is a lack of information and knowledge, which leads to SMEs’ weak bargaining <br>positions in terms of: interest  paid; ass et and liability disclosure; misuse of loan fund s; and generally poor <br>preparedness when applying for business loans. Other reasons include  <br>• lack of collateral  <br>• lack of a sound or bankable business plan  <br>• the conditions imposed by the financial instit utions  <br>• high transaction costs.  <br>16.4.2 Funding agencies in South Africa  <br>While many organisations (both private and public) have been established to support SME development in <br>South Africa, lack of access to finance from these organisations remains a problem  and conti nues to affect <br>people who want to start or grow their own businesses. In SA, commercial banks generally do not regard the <br>majority of people as bankable or creditworthy. An important part of the national small business strategy is <br>therefore to cr eate an en abling environment for entrepreneurs and small b usinesses to access finances. <br>Although a number of institutions have been set up, there is still a very long way to go. South African <br>government funding and grants are focused on providing funding f or busines s ventures that can make a 268 <br> difference to the eco nomy. Below are some of the institutions providing financial support to SMEs in South <br>Africa.  <br>16.4.2.1 Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)  <br>The DTI has a range of funding schemes for qualifying en terprises from a range of sectors of our society. <br>Financia l assistance by the DTI covers areas such as manufacturing activities, business competitiveness, <br>export development, market access and creating a platform for foreign direct investment <br>(http://www.thedti .gov.za ). <br>16.4.2.2 National Empowerment Fund (NEF)  <br>This organisation is aimed at supporting broad -based black economic empowerment (B -BEEE) and previously <br>disadvantaged individuals and communities with both financial and non -financial assistance. It offer s funding <br>for start -ups and growing enterprises as a  loan; equity funding; funding black -empowered businesses; <br>assistance with business planning; mentorship support; and early -stage investments <br>(http://w ww.nefcorp.co.za ). <br>16.4.2.3 National Youth Developm ent Agency (NYDA)  <br>The NYDA provides youth enterprise grants for young entrepreneurs aged between 18 and 35 year and aims <br>to assist them in startin g a business or growing an existing one. The model for acc essing their financial support <br>is available on their  website:  http://www.nyda.gov.za  <br>16.4.2.4 Isivande Women’s Fund  <br>The Isivande Women’s Fund is a n exclusive funding scheme established to specifically emp ower women with <br>existing businesses. With the fundin g scheme, education programme and training they offer to women, the <br>Isivande aims to accelerate women’s economic empowerment with affordable and r eliable financial solutions <br>(http://www.thedti.gov.za ). <br>16.4.2.5 Land Bank  <br>As the name suggests, the Land Bank offers a wide range of loans to cater for all financial needs, including <br>buying land, equip ment and working capital for agricultural projects. One of  the requirements that must <br>accompany the applicatio n is a business plan (http://www.landbank.co.za ). <br>16.4.2.6 Technology Innovation Agency (TI A) <br>The Technology Innovation Agency (TIA) was established in 2008 with the purpose of stimulating and <br>intensif ying all technological innovation in South Africa to support economic growth (http://www.tia.org .za). <br>16.4.2.7 Development Bank of South Africa (DBSA)  <br>The DBSA focuses on financing infrastructure developme nt projects; the South Africa financing division <br>primarily provides long -term debt solutions for infrastructure projects (http://www.dbsa.org ). <br>16.4.2.8 Ga uteng Enterprise Propeller (GEP)  <br>Gauteng Enterprise Propeller (GEP) is an agency of the Gauteng provincial government established  as a <br>vehicle to drive economic growth in the province. The main obje ctive of the agency is enterprise development <br>within the G auteng province of South Africa. This includes finan cial and non -financial support to small, <br>medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) and cooperatives (http://www.gep.co.za ). 269 <br> 16.4.2.9 Other non -government insti tutions  <br>• Commercial banks:  have specialist SME divisi ons, providing finance for qualifying entrepreneurs. Though <br>they have funding available, it remains difficult for many SMEs to access funds from c ommercial banks <br>due to the stringent criteria set by the b anks.  <br>• Business partners:  is a specialist risk -financ e company that provides customised financial solutions, sectoral <br>knowledge, mentorship, business premises and other added -value services for forma l SMEs in South <br>Africa and selected African countries.  <br>The non-financial support offered by the above institut ions cover a wide range of business management <br>support services to entrepreneurs and small enterprises, such as:  <br>• Developing business plans  <br>• Doing m arket research  <br>• Managing a small business  <br>• Legal requirement s of small businesses  <br>• Marketing  <br>• Business development  <br>• Advice on government tender processes, etc.  <br>Two of the most popular and effective non -financial support mechanisms to SMMEs are incubations and <br>clusters, which are discussed in  section 16.5 . <br> <br>16.5 SMALL -BUSINESS INCUBATION  <br>Small -business incubation is a unique and highly flexible combin ation of business -development processes, <br>infrastructure and people designed to nurture new and small businesses by helping them to survive and grow <br>through the difficult and vulnerable early s tages of development (Menon & Malik, 2016). No doubt, incubators  <br>provide small businesses (particularly start -ups) with the enabling environment most needed to develop and <br>grow their businesses, offering everything from virtual support, rent -a-desk through  to st ate-of-the-art <br>laboratories and everything in between. Inc ubators create direct access to hands -on intensive business support, <br>as well as to finance, experts and other entrepreneurs and potential suppliers for the small business to prosper.  <br>Business incuba tion is basically a location in which entrepreneurs can re ceive proactive, value -added support, <br>and access to critical tools, information, education, contacts, resources and capital that may otherwise be <br>unaffordable, inaccessible or unknown.  <br>16.5.1 Purpos e of business incubation  <br>In emerging economies, business i ncubation is one of the tools that gives confidence to the nation to create <br>new entrepreneurial businesses with support guarantees for the duration of the incubation period. The purpose <br>of inc ubator s is to increase the chance of success for start -up busine sses, and help reduce the cost of start -up <br>and growing the business. The incubation process improves the survival rate of start -up companies by assisting <br>them to become financially viable, usu ally w ithin two to three years. The whole activity of establishi ng and <br>maintaining a business incubator is both exhausting and exciting at the same time.  <br>The following steps help understand the whole start -up process until the incubator is fully functional . <br>16.5.2 Different incubation programmes  <br>• Government incubators:  incubators in South Africa are largely funded by the government.  270 <br> • University -based incubators:  as could be expected, university -based incubators also provide training <br>opportunities for students  and s erve as commercial outlets for faculty research. Among the  university -<br>related services, student employees, faculty consultants, library/information databases, labs/workshops <br>and sophisticated equipment, and technology -transfer programmes were used mo re by clients and <br>perceived to be adding value to their partners hip. <br>• Public -private partnership incubators  (PPPs) (Innovation Hub and UFS Science Park): the growing <br>professionalisation of role players has encouraged governments, local development agencies,  priva te <br>economic interests and academics to play an active role  in the incubation space.  <br>• Private incubators  (Raizcorp, Aurik, etc.): incubators that invest and build small businesses into medium - <br>and large -sized businesses and at times sell them.  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 271 <br> Figur e 16.2 Steps in setting up an incubator  <br> <br> <br>Source:  Adapted  from SA Business Incubator Establishment Handbook  (DTI, 2014)  <br>16.5.3 Benefits of using business incubators  <br>• Small -business owners enjoy immediate availability of resources, technical support and  know-how to assist <br>them in optimal growth and development.  <br>272 <br> • Incubators provide administrative support to entrepreneurs needing to grow – this normally comes in the <br>form of a general assistant, interns (especially if the incubator is related  to a university ), affordable <br>bookkeeping, CPA and legal services, as well as access to basic office gadgets and supplies.  <br>• It provides a nurturing, entrepreneurial and friendly learning environment for the entrepreneur.  <br>• Entrepreneurs are surrounded by experts who can prov ide mentorship and professional support.  <br>• It is a playground fo r investors in search of innovations or take overs.  <br>• Incubators have access to different markets.  <br>• Provides access to capital – all types of early -stage investors – angels, seed funds, venture cap ital – have <br>their radars on incubators, especially the ones wi th a successful record of spinning good companies.  <br>• Incubators provide better access to connectivity – other than connecting with fellow incubated companies <br>and proximate resources, there are sev eral national, regional and even global incubator networks and  <br>programmes, such as Brazil’s Anprotec and World Bank’s global infoDev. This means that if one intends to <br>go global with the business, find new strategic partners in different countries, or benc hmar k experiences, <br>being in an incubator space can also be ver y useful.  <br>16.5.4 The incubation process  <br>Entrepreneurs who wish to enter a business incubation programme need to be aware of the following process:  <br>• Application for admission  <br>• The acceptance criter ia which vary from programme to programme and from one incubat or to another  <br>Generally only those who meet the requirements (either feasible business ideas or a workable business plan) <br>are admitted.  <br>16.5.5 The basic model for SME incubation  <br>According to Tam budz e (2012), South Africa has a thriving SME sector and there  are many companies <br>offering a variety of incubation programmes, with the majority of them structured according to sectors of the <br>economy. Below is a list of business incubators in South Africa provided by Tambudze (2012), and the list <br>could be endless.  <br>• The African Rose Enterprise Development  provides support to emerging essential -oil farmers and <br>agroprocessing business.  <br>• Aurik  invests and builds small businesses into medium -sized businesses and then sells them.  <br>• Bodibeng technology incubator  is a virtual and  real-estate incubator, which supporte d high -tech <br>entrepreneurs in starting and growing their businesses by offering innovative products and services.  <br>• Chemin  supports the start -up and growth of SMEs  in the downstream chemical industry. Chemin is located <br>in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape province , but operates nationally.  <br>• Endeavor  is a non -profit organisation that identifies and assists high -growth entrepreneurs in emerging <br>markets around the world by p roviding support for entrepreneurs who are transforming th eir <br>communities, their industries and their countries with their visionary ideas.  <br>• The Downstream Aluminium Centre for Technology  is located in Richards Bay, Kwa -Zulu -Natal Province and <br>focuses on tr aining, skills development and the incubation of small ent erprises in the aluminium casting <br>indu stry.  <br>• Egoli Bio  assists entrepreneurial life sciences and biotechnology ventures, helping them to survive and grow <br>during the start -up phase.  <br>• Furntech  provides training, skills development and business -incubation suppo rt to potential entrepreneurs <br>and smal l enterprises involved in furniture manufacturing.  <br>• The Innovation Hub  is a science and technology park whose main aim is to increase the wealth of its <br>community  by promoting the culture of innovation and the competitiv eness of its associated businesses <br>and knowledge -based institutions. It has created a unique space for high -tech entrepreneurs, world -class <br>businesses, academics, researchers and venture capitalists  to meet, network and prosper.  <br> <br> 273 <br> Figure 16.3 The basic m odel for incubation  <br> <br>• Shanduka Black Umbr ellas  is a non -profit company involved in enterprise development and more <br>specifically the support of emerging black business. Black Umbrellas provides a sup portive, incubator -style <br>environment for emerging, wholly -owned black businesses.  <br>• Mpumalanga Agri -skills incubator  promotes sustainable agricultural empowerment, and the development <br>and entrepreneurship of previously disadvantaged individuals and communiti es in Mpumalanga to create <br>sustainable small agricultural enterprises and lower the risk of financi ers, thereby making funding more <br>accessible to small -scale farmers.  <br>• Mpumalanga Stainless Initiative (MSI)  is an incubator funded by the DTI and it deals spec ifically with SMEs <br>operating in the manufacturing sector.  <br>• The Nelson Mandela Bay Incubator  focused on small ICT enterprises within the Eastern Cape Province. It <br>hosts entrepreneurs and supports them with services such as mentorship, physical infrastructure , and <br>sectoral and investor networking.  <br>• SEDA Automotive Te chnology Centre  aims to develop technology -influenced products or services for the <br>automotive industry. Through its partnership with Tshwane University of Technology and the CSIR, the <br>centre provide s technical as well as business -development support servic es to entreprene urs and small <br>enterprises.  <br>• The SEDA construction incubator  provides business -support services, office infrastructure and other <br>resources to eligible businesses in the construction se ctor. It focuses specifically on the development of <br>small contracting firm s classified under the Construction Industries Development Board (CIDB) as grade 3.  <br>• SEDA essential oils business incubator  empowers emerging farmers to produce, and in some instances  <br>process, high -value essential oils. The incubator transfe rs appropriate t echnologies to emerging farmers in <br>order to facilitate starting or increasing commercially viable essential oil production.  <br>• SEDA Limpopo jewellery incubator  develops entrepreneurial jewellers in the Limpopo Province.  <br>• SEDA Maphura -Makhura in cubator  is a tra ining -and-technology demonstration incubator, which trains local <br>farmers to plant sunflower and soya beans to produce biodiesel.  <br>• SEDA platinum incubator  is a platinum beneficiation a nd jewellery training and manufacturing incubator, <br>which a ims to create an  internationally recognised centre of platinum beneficiation excellence and is <br>dedicated to the advancement of skills in the beneficiation of platinum group metals.  <br>• Soft-Start busine ss and technology incubator  is a real -estate incubator, wh ich assists inno vative early stage <br>information and communication technology (ICT) entrepreneurs with mentoring and support in the <br>strategy and practice of growing a sustainable business.  <br>274 <br> • Soshanguve Manufacturing Technology Demonstration Centre  demonstrates  small -scale man ufacturing <br>machinery and equipment to train entrepreneurs to operate and maintain technologies and to establish <br>new small -scale manufacturing and services ventures. Its vision is to accelerate the establishment and <br>development of low -cost s mall manufacturi ng enterprises.  <br>• Timbali technology incubator  aims to create a centre for the establishment and support of emerging <br>farmers in the cut -flower market.  <br>16.6 CLUSTERS  <br>Clusters are geogra phic concentrations of interconnected firms, specialist su ppliers, service providers, firms <br>in related industries and associated institutions (Porter, 1998).  <br>Clusters are a concentration of firms that are able to produce synergy because of their proximity and <br>interdependence, even though their scale of employment  may not be pronounced.  <br>16.6.1 Benefits of operating in a cluster environment  <br>• Transaction and transport costs are reduced.  <br>• Industry stakeholders can easily come face -to-face with one another.  <br>• This f ace-to-face provides an opportunity for information sharin g. <br>• There is easy access to training services and industry research outputs.  <br>• Provedes access to a large workforce with skills in the industry.  <br>• Provides access to suppliers of raw m aterials and, at ti mes, industry clients.  <br>• Provides an opportunity for informa l interaction and learning, and a strong market focus.  <br>• Decreases production costs due to mass production.  <br>Tavassoli (2009) has identified four ways of cluster foundation. Among th e four ways, which can lead to the <br>foundation of a cluster, the first three c an be perceived as the stimulus to the firms (and other actors) to be <br>engaged in a cluster. The last way can be perceived as a means for cluster initiation.  <br>• First, clustering of f irms in a particula r location can happen in order to gain proximity to an ori ginal large <br>customer or large market, such as financial services near the stock exchanges in New York City.  <br>• Second, clustering can happen because of the attraction of specific res ources and natural advantages in a <br>specific geographical region for the firms . Some examples of such natural advantages are ore deposits, <br>transportation routes, climate, labour with specific skills, or low -cost labour. The cluster of Montebelluna <br>in Italy is composed of abou t 420 companies specialising in the design, development, p roduction and <br>distribution of sport shoes and the California wine cluster, which includes 680 commercial wineries as well <br>as several thousand independent wine grape growers are tw o examples of this kind of cluster.  <br>• Third, concentration and origination of a  specific technology in a region and relevant demand or skill means <br>that technology can also be a way for firms to work with a cluster. The SMIL cluster in Sweden is one good <br>exam ple. SMIL network, supported by the university and the Centre of Innovation a nd Entrepreneurship <br>(CIE), has subsequently developed a portfolio of highly recognised activities designed to promote the <br>growth and development of knowledge -intensive firms (LaurCorrespondenceines sa.laur@liu.se , Klofsten <br>& Bienkowska, 2012).  <br>• Fourth, a typical cluster can be initiated by an entrepreneur who starts a particular industrial activity in a <br>particular location. If the new venture is successful, a cluster can begin to grow and prosper.  <br>One classic example of a functional cluster in South Africa is the Automotive Supplier Park (ASP), which is <br>owned and managed by the Automotive Industry Development Centre (AIDC). The ASP is located i n Rosslyn <br>and spans an area of 130 hectares, with a pool  of tenants comprising mainly component manufacturers and <br>suppliers to OEMs, which require a continuous supply of components to assembly plants. Owing to ASP’s <br>locality, manufacturers of automotive co mponents, suppliers and service providers enjoy the bene fits gained <br>from synergies and cost -saving opportunities.  275 <br> 16.6.2 ASP cluster benefits  <br>According to Gwala (2014), here are some of the possible benefits:  <br>• Strategic location:  the ASP is strategically pl aced in close proximity to major OEM plants including th e likes <br>of BMW (3.3km), Nissan/Renault (1.3km), TATA (0.5km) and Ford/Mazda (35km).  <br>• Shared infrastructure, services and facilities:  ASP tenants enjoy the benefit of shared infrastructure and <br>value -added services including facilities management, ICT service s, centralised security, logistic services, <br>conference facilities, a canteen and healthcare facilities.  <br>• State -of-the-art ICT infrastructure:  ASP provides advanced ICT infrastructure and services. Tena nts are <br>offered a wide range of services including affor dable routing IP telephony service, broadband internet and <br>email, server access, back -up and data -recovery services, ICT support, access control and CCTV <br>monitoring.  <br>• World -class production environment : the design of the ASP is modern with aesthetically -appealing gardens <br>and common areas.  <br>• Turnkey buildings developed to tenant requirements:  factories are developed to tenant requirements and <br>legislative approvals. The design and finishes of the buildings are governed by the ASP’s architectural <br>guidelines and m eet international automotive standards.  <br>• Logistics networks:  ASP tenants benefit from warehousing and distribution services that are rendered by <br>independent service providers. A significant benefit to ASP tenants is a centrally -located container depot, <br>whic h is able to handle all inbound and outbound container traffic.  <br>16.7 GROWING AN ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURE  <br>A business is differentiated by its ability to grow and create more jobs over a period of time. A business is <br>said to be growing when it begins to sell  more products or generate more income. When a business is able to <br>cut costs and net more money from raising profitability, it also grows. Every entrepreneurial business aims at <br>growing above the infla tion targets. It is for this reason that this chapter h ighlights important growth issues.  <br>16.7.1 Characteristics of a growing firm  <br>• Good governance:  this has eight major characteristics; it is participatory, consensus oriented, accountable, <br>transparent, res ponsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusi ve and follows the rule of law.  <br>• Healthy cash flow:  this provides the comfort and capabilities a business needs to invest in growth.  <br>• Strong marketing team:  the strong foundation of modern marketing buil ds towards a team culture with <br>integrity, character, creat ivity and loyalty. This will help provide the vision for where your brand is going <br>and it attracts the “A players” you want on your marketing team.  <br>• High  ethical standards:  a business that exemplifie s integrity in its products, services and actions holds it self <br>up to high ethical standards.  <br>16.7.2 Different growth strategies for an enterprise  <br>• Increase sales to your existing customers:  providing superior cu stomer service, excellent quality and loyalty <br>programmes cannot only help you maintain your existing cus tomers but also help you secure repeat <br>business and increase sales volume. In addition, satisfied customers  can also help sell your business by <br>telling others about your products and services.  <br>• Expan d to other markets:  this may include opening another locat ion, expanding your target market, or <br>exporting to a foreign market.  <br>• Diversification strategies:  these include a multiplication of income streams to max imise profitability and fill <br>any seasonal void s. <br>• Franchise:  this is a great way to find talented people to manage your locations and give them an incentive to <br>work hard. The beauty of this strategy is a win -win situation for both the franchisor and franchi see. 276 <br> Franchising allows the business to distri bute its offerings to a much wider market through the use of <br>franchises.  <br>• Forming a strategic alliance:  this is an agreement between two or more parties to pursue a set of agreed -<br>upon objectives needed while rem aining independent organisations. This form of  cooperation lies <br>between mergers and acquisitions and org anic growth.  <br>• Cost -maintenance strategy:  the more efficient the production methods, the lower the cost per unit. In <br>addition, it is important for a busin ess to explore ways of reducing costs of suppl ies without compromising <br>the quality of any product or a s ervice.  <br>• The use of technology:  the internet can assist with other methods of appealing to existing or new markets, <br>or marketing the products and service s online.  <br>• Licensing strategy:  licensing of a p roduct or any other form of intellectual property to other s can be an <br>effective way to grow a business. It enables one to receive upfront fees and ongoing royalties while taking <br>advantage of the production and distribution methods already established by an other company.  <br>• Mergers and acquisitions (M&A):  these are t ransactions in which the ownership of companies, other <br>business enterprises or their operating units are combined or acquired. As an aspect of strategic  <br>management, M&A can allow enterprises to grow , shrink, change the nature of their business or improve <br>their competitive position.  <br>16.8 LISTING ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE MARKETS  <br>16.8.1 Brief summary of the stock exchange market  <br>Listing is usually an investment instrument, thus taking a non -public owned en terprise and inviting <br>shareholders to invest in the busine ss in a manner that they can hold or trade their investment in that particular <br>business on a stock exchange. Generally, the role of any stock exchange is to create a regulated and orderly <br>marketplac e where providers of capital and organisations that requir e capital can equally transact to their <br>mutual benefit. In South Africa, the JSE fulfils this role by creating a mechani sm through which providers of <br>capital can earn a return on their investments b y way of dividends, interest and/or capital growth, while the <br>organisations in which they invest provide employment opportunities and economic development (MacLeod, <br>2008). Accord ing to Tsele (2016), the JSE is an ideal listing destination for companies loo king to raise capital <br>by tapping the large pool of local, global and institutional investor capital.  <br>16.8.2 The history and role of the JSE in South Africa  <br>• 1887:  The JSE was esta blished as a stock exchange to enable new mining ventures to raise funds for t he <br>development of the then fledgling mining industry.  <br>• 1947 : The Stock Exchanges Control Act was promulgated to regulate the operation of exchanges in South <br>Africa.  <br>• 1963:  The JSE became a member of the World Federation of Exchanges.  <br>• 1995:  Formation of the S outh African Institute of Stockbrokers.  <br>• 1996:  The open -outcry trading floor was closed on 7 June and replaced by the electronic JET system.  <br>• 1997:  The Securities Exchange News Service (SENS) was introduced to ensure early and wide dissemination <br>of all infor mation that may affect the prices of securities trading on  the JSE (http://www.jse.org.za ). <br>16.8.3 Listing categories  <br>Historically, the JSE had three listing categories;  <br>• The Main Board:  well-established co mpanies who want to grow their business exponentially are listed on <br>the JSE’s Main Board. This is where you will find the JSE’s top 40 stocks, as well as securities like exchange -<br>traded funds (ETFs), exchange -traded notes (ETNs) and warrants.  277 <br> • The Developme nt Capital Market (DCM):  this was created in 1984 in recog nition of the need to encourage <br>the growth of small companies not able to list on the Main Board. However, the e mergence of the AltX <br>seems to have caused the DCM to decline.  <br>• The Venture Capital Mark et (VCM):  this comprises companies specialising in the hol ding of portfolio <br>investments in venture -capital projects and/or single -venture companies.  <br>16.8.3.1 The new smal l enterprise market on the JSE (AltX)  <br>The Alternative Exchange (AltX)  <br>Launched in Octo ber 2003 as an additional market for SMEs, the AltX is the  new market specifically tailored <br>to accommodate entrepreneurial SMMEs on the JSE. It is the intention of the JS E that the AltX will become <br>the preferred market in place of the DCM and the VCM. Howe ver, for now the DCM and VCM will continue <br>to operate.  <br>For companies to be listed on any of the four boards of the JSE, they need to meet specific criteria.  <br>Table 16.2  summarises the key criteria needed to meet these requirements.  <br>Table 16.2 Summa ry of key criteria for listing on the JSE  <br>Criterion  Main Board  DCM  VCM  AltX <br>Number of  shares  25 000 000  1 000 000  1 000 000  2 000 000  <br>Value of  subscribed capital  R25 000 000  R1 000 000  R500 000  R2 000 000  <br>Profit history  3 years audited  2 years audited  not required  not required  <br>Public spread  20% 10% 10% 10% <br>Number of shareholders  500 75 75 100 <br>Source:  https://www.jse.co.za/…/JSESpecifications Items/Guidelines%20to%20Listing%20on%…  <br>The JSE updated its listing requirements in 2003 to take account of global trends towards greater levels of <br>corporate governance and compliance with Statements  of Generally Acc epted Accounting Practice (GAAP). <br>Accordi ngly, all companies seeking admission to the Main Board, DCM and VCM must appoint a JSE -<br>registered sponsor. Please visit  http://www.jse.org.za  for more information regarding the JSE.  <br>16.8.3.2 The benefits of listing a business  <br>• Local analyst coverage as well as high media interest  <br>• Helps improve your corporate reputation and profile  <br>• Businesses can potentially attract international investors  <br>• Helps impro ve the company’s capital -raising ability, which can be use d for funding organic growth or <br>acquisitions  <br>• Listing can enhance dealings with banks, suppliers, distributors and customers due to the greater <br>transparency, regulation and monitoring that companies are subjected to  <br>• Allows businesses to increase liquidity f or investors and allows shareholders to realise the value of their <br>investments through a public trading platform and facilitate B-BBEE deals.  <br>16.8.3.3 Disadvantages of listing a business  <br>• There is an  annual listing fee to pay to maintain a listing in additi on to the costs of listing.  278 <br> • Upon listing, the company is also bound to comply with the listing requirements of the JSE.  <br>• Listing  compels the company to improve the quality of its reporting and so imp rove the quality of <br>information available for decision mak ing. <br>• Compliance can be expensive in terms of cost and management time.  <br>• Listed companies can be sanctioned by the JSE if they br each the listings requirements.  <br>16.8.4 Requirements for listing  <br>The lis ting requirements of the JSE apply to all companies listed  on the Main Board or the AltX. According <br>to MacLeod (2008), these relate to the following:  <br>• Publication of financial results  <br>• Issue of cautionary announcements  <br>• Directors dealing in shares of the comp any <br>• Acquisitions or disposals  <br>• All matters relating to the listing requirements and the continuing obligations of listed companies  <br>16.9 MIGRATION FROM ALTX TO THE MAIN BOARD  <br>The AltX board was developed to serve smaller companies and 114 companies have list ed on the board since <br>its inception in October 2003. A com pany decides internally at what stage it wants to move from the AltX to <br>the Main Board once the company can comply with the requirements of a Main Board listing. This includes <br>that the company must have subscribed share capital of R25 million and the requi site pre -tax profits.  <br>16.9.1 The merits of migrating from the AltX to th e Main Board  <br>According to MacLeod (2008), the AltX was created to provide SMEs with an opportunity to raise capital <br>without be ing subject to the rigorous regulatory requirements and co sts that characterise the Main Board. <br>Companies listing on the AltX ther efore have smaller capital requirements for listing than their Main Board <br>counterparts, require fewer shareholders, do not req uire a profit history and have lower annual listing fees. <br>The key differences between the two exchanges are presented in  Table 16.3 . This means that a small business <br>in the AltX market simply needs to fulfil  the requirements presented in the Main Board in order to qualify for <br>a migration to it. In terms of benefits, AltX offers man y of the same benefits as the Main Board, enabling <br>businesses to raise funds and gain public exposure while enjoying favourable re gulation and reduced fees <br>relative to their Main Board counterparts. The high -growth and high -risk nature of these firms, howe ver, <br>makes them a niche investment choice for many investors.  <br>Table 16.3 Listing requirements for the AltX versus the Main Board o f the JSE  <br>Listing requirements  Main Board  AltX <br>Share capital  R25 million  R2 million  <br>Profit history  3 Years  None  <br>Pre-tax pro fit R8 million  N/A <br>Shareholder spread  20% 10% <br>Number of shareholders  300 100 279 <br> Listing requirements  Main Board  AltX <br>Publication in the press  Compulsory  Voluntary  <br>Annual listing fee  0.04% of average market capitalisation  R22 000  <br>Source:  Kruger (2014)  <br> <br>According to MacLeod (2008), all AltX co mpanies must retain the services of a designated Advisor (DA) who <br>is responsible for determining the suitability of the company fo r listing, advises the company on the listing <br>process and provides ongoing oversight f or the company’s continued listing. DAs therefore enjoy a significant <br>degree of control over which companies are allowed to list and the fact that the listing requirement s for AltX <br>companies are so much less rigorous means that it is far easier for these c ompanies to obtain a listing.  <br>16.9.2 Lis ting time frame  <br>The listing time frame normally covers between nine and 13 weeks, depending on the method of  listing, the <br>competen ce of the professional advisors and the complexity of the listing.  <br>The typical time fr ame has been summarised in  Table 16.4 . <br>Table 16.4 Typical time frame for listin g on the JSE  <br>Company  Co           Corpora te advisor  CA           Accountant  A <br>Sponsor  S Legal advisor  LA     <br>WEEK  ACTION  RESPONSIBILITY  <br>0 Appoint advisors  <br>Meet to consider: legal, financial and tax implications  <br>Method of listing  <br>Prepare timetable for listingAfrica’s  <br>top ten franchises, look at Table 18.1 and  <br>consider where  <br>Commence preparation of accountants report  <br>Commence drafting of documentation  Co <br>A, LA, CA and Co  <br>CA <br>A and Co  <br>CA <br>1-3 Drafting meetings to finalise draft documentation (prospectus, <br>prelisting, statement)  <br>Finalise accountant ’s report  CA, LA, A, S and <br>Co <br>A and Co  <br>4 Draft documentation submitted to t he JSE for informal comment and  <br>registrar (if public offer)  S and CA  <br>5-8 JSE formal approval, and registrar’s approval (if a public offer)  <br>obtained  S and CA  280 <br> 9-10 Listing commence s if an introduction, or placing or public offer  <br>commences    <br>11 Placing closes    <br>12 Listing commences if a placing or public offer closes    <br>13 Listing commences if a public offer    <br>Source:  http://www.jse .co.za  <br>16.10 CONCLUSION  <br>In this chapter we introduced you to the concept of enterprise development. It is evident that enterprise <br>development is not an event but a chain of activities aimed at accelerating economic growth through SMEs. <br>Understanding busin ess incubation and its processes should have enhanced your knowledge and it is envisaged <br>that you will have developed some interest in the topic. The expected results of ED programmes and activities <br>are for the business to begin its listing  on the AltX and  ultimately migrate to the Main Board. For small <br>businesses to be listed it is important to understand the markets, the requirements for listing and also how long <br>it takes for the business to be listed on the stock exchange.  <br>REVIEW QUESTIONS  <br>16.1 Identify non-financial support that SMEs can enjoy from support institutions.  <br>16.2 At what stage do certain warning signs begin to appear, alerting entrepreneurs of the need to reinvent the business?  <br>16.3 Provide the reason why companies listing on the Alt X have sm aller capital requirements for listing than their Main <br>Board counterparts, and why they require fewer shareholders, do not require a profit history and have lower annual <br>listing fees.  <br>REFERENCES  <br>Department of Trade and Industry. 2014.

The chapter presents compelling reasons why tourism, as a vital economic industry, must be <br>developed through entrepreneurship , and presents the critical success factors that are necessary to ensure that <br>the industry at tains a positive growth trajectory. The concept of entrepreneurship is famous for bringing <br>innovation and value creation to all sectors in general and it has recei ved increased attention within tourism <br>research, reflecting the important role of entrepreneu rs and new startups within the tourism industry for <br>innovation and value creation (Alvedalen & Boschma, 2017). Tourism is the world’s largest industry and is <br>full of opportunities for communities and entrepreneurs to exploit. SMMEs in tourism are famous fo r making <br>an economic contribution and providing employment to local populations (Buhalis & Peters in Buhalis & <br>Costa, 2006). This chapter will equip you with a det ailed understanding of the tourism industry, its intricacies <br>and its dynamic nature. This wil l result in a better understanding and appreciation of tourism as a sector and <br>an economic force.  <br>The visitor and consumption economy that is tourism is considered  to be an important economic sector from <br>the most advanced economies to the Third World count ries. Tourism as a people’s industry, where the majority <br>of the service is provided by people, places a high premium on superior customer service. In tourism, the <br>customer is king, and customers vote with their feet by returning to tourism establishments t hat give superior <br>customer service. The tourism industry and entrepreneurship in general require superior customer service <br>delivery from not just the tourism produ ct providers but from related companies that may not be in the tourism <br>industry, such  as safe ty and security, and how citizens conduct themselves towards tourists. A service culture <br>therefore remains at the centre of delivering the superior customer servic e that is necessary to satisfy customers <br>of the tourism product offerings.  <br>The consumption ec onomy is very different from the production economy as there is no physical product but <br>there is a service that is consumed. Tourism has been used as a means to tr ansform urban and rural spaces to 285 <br> cater for the needs of the visitor economy. While on the ot her hand, entrepreneurship is a critical ingredient <br>for economic growth and addresses unemployment.  <br>17.2 DEFINITION OF TOURISM  <br>There are several definitions of tou rism that are used. This section will start by unpackiing tourism, followed <br>by tourism entrep reneurship. According to Saayman (2013), tourism can be described as the total experience <br>that originates from the interaction between tourists, job providers, gov ernment systems, and communities in <br>the process of providing attractions, entertainment, tran sport and accommodation to tourists. Tourism has <br>further been defined by Chaudhuri and Ray (2018) as comprising the activities of persons travelling to and <br>staying  in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year, for leisur e, business <br>and other purposes. The usual environment of a person consists of a certain area around his or her place of <br>residence, plus all other places he or she frequently visits. It is clear then that tourism includes some of the <br>following elements:  <br>• A temporary movement of people from their place of residence to visit a destination  <br>• An element of journeying to and back from the destination  <br>• Any pastime that is not for purposes of taking up employment at the destination area  <br>• An economic contribution on the journey to the destination and from the destination to the tourist’s home  <br>• An escape from routine that is practised at home  <br>The journey is influenced by motivation. Cooper, Fletcher, Fyall, Gilbert and Wanhill (2008) note tha t the <br>“pull” to visit destinatio ns energises the whole tourism system and creates demand for travel in the generating <br>region.  <br>A tourist is therefore the human actor who consumes the tourism product offerings, and the tourists are <br>coproducers of the experie nce they consume. The production  of the tourism experience requires the active <br>participation of tourists and staff members during the “moment of truth” when service has to be simultaneously <br>produced and consumed. Saayman (2013) explains that a tourist is a  person who voluntarily visits a  place <br>away from his or her normal abode for a period of at least 24 hours. According to Cooper et al. (2008), tourists <br>can be classified according to the purpose of their visit, which includes  <br>• holidays that include leisure,  recreation, sports, cultural ac tivities and visiting friends and relatives (VFR)  <br>• other tourism purposes, including study - and health tourism  <br>• business and professional travel including meetings, conferences, missions, incentives and business tourism.  <br>Touri sts are further classified into the following categories, according to Saayman (2013):  <br>• Domestic or local (national) tourists:  this refers to the inhabitants who travel from one province or area <br>within a country to another for vacation or business purposes.  <br>• International tourists:  this re fers to local inhabitants who visit a country other than their home country for a <br>period of at least 24 hours.  <br>• Excursionists (day visitors):  excursionists stay in the location for less than 24 hours. Excursionists are, in <br>essence, day visitors and thus are  not tourists. It must be understood clearly that excursionists can also be <br>domestic and/or foreign; in other words, they are people who travel from one country or area to another <br>as day visitors.  <br>Tourism is developmed becau se of the positive economic impa cts such as labour intensive jobs and stimulating <br>small businesses. Tourism is associated with entrepreneurship as the arrival of “new money” into the local <br>economy and encourages people to start businesses. Tourists at the destination are, are market read y to have <br>their needs met using their cash laden wallets. The subject of both tourism and entrepreneurship has been <br>researched widely. While tourism is famous  for stimulating local entrepreneurship and mediating in the <br>globa l–local divide (Ateljevic & Page , 2009), entrepreneurship has been characterised differently across <br>different sectors. For example, other studies refer to tourism entrepreneurs differently. According to Rusu, 286 <br> Csorba, Cureteanu and Isac (2014), tourism entr epreneurship means a lot of comm ercial activities done by <br>firms (at micro - and macroeconomic level) which operate in urban or rural areas owned by small individual <br>business owners, by groups of business partners or private/public companies with limited lia bilities, which <br>offer a wide ran ge of tourism services. Sifolo and Anyi (2018) claim that tourism entrepreneurship involves a <br>process whereby an individual or firm sees an opportunity in the tourism supply chain by taking a risk and <br>opening a legal entity to deliver a service or product,  or participating in tourism -related activities, thereby <br>contributing to economic development and making a profit. Hence Adiyia, De Rademaeker, Vanneste and <br>Ahebwa, (2017), assert that tourism acts as a catalyst for small en terprise development in the loca l economy <br>without inducing major skill leakages and can enlarge people’s capabilities, awareness and assets to control <br>their own well -being.  <br>17.3 THE TOURISM SYSTEM  <br>Tourism consumption that is the hallmark of the visitor eco nomy is defined by an element of  travel that the <br>tourist(s) undertake to a tourism destination. The travel may be within the area of residence or further away, <br>requiring them to be away from home for more than 24 hours. Saayman (2013) identified that the t ourist <br>experiences can be divide d into five phases:  <br>1. The planning phase  <br>2. The journey to the destination  <br>3. The destination experience  <br>4. The return journey  <br>5. The memory phase  <br>Tourism is considered to be a system, hence the application of the tourism system. For one to recognise <br>entrepreneurial opp ortunities that exist within the tourism industry, it is crucial to refer to the tourism system. <br>Inskeep (1991) notes that although c omplicated, cutting across sectoral categories, tourism is and should be <br>viewed as a single system comprising interrelated parts. As a system, it can be defined, analysed, planned and <br>managed in an integrated manner. According to Leiper (1979), spatially t ourism involves three elements. <br>There is an origin or tourism -generating region, the place where the tours begin and end (h ome). There is a <br>tourism -destination region or host locality, where tourists stay temporarily. Thirdly, there is a transit region <br>or route, which connects the two and through which tourists travel. The tourism system constitutes the <br>following three geograp hical areas:  <br>• The tourism -generating region, according to George (2008), is the area (e.g. country, province, city) from <br>which the tou rist originates, and is also referred to as the market or origin region.  <br>• The tourism -destination area is where the majority  of the tourism consumption occurs, and is the primary <br>reason that motivated the travel in the first place.  <br>• The transit region, accor ding to Visser (2008), refers to those places, routes and areas tourists pass through, <br>and the mode and means by which they  travel to the destinations.  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 287 <br> Figure 17.1 Henama’s tourism circulation system  <br> <br>The geographical elements of tourism  <br> <br>The tourism indus try is difficult to define because it is a collection of various businesses that provide direct <br>and indirect operations to  the tourists. The tourism industry is divided into eight sectors and subsectors <br>involved in delivery of the tourism product offering.  The eight sectors of the tourism industry include travel <br>organisers, transportation, accommodation providers, support ser vices, visitor attractions, <br>destination  management organisations, and commercial and industrial policymakers.  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>288 <br> Figure 17.2 The sectors and subsectors of the tourism industry  <br> <br>Source:  Hermann & Du Plessis (2016)  <br>17.4 TOURISM PRODUCT OFFERING  <br>Henama (2013) s tates that the tourism industry combines primary (land, labour, etc.) and intermediaries <br>(hotels, shops, mode of transport, etc.) inpu ts to produce intermediate outputs such as accommodation, meals <br>or performances. The intermediate outputs are used to prod uce intangible experiences that are the final <br>products that are valued. In the process of offering products or services in the tourism  industry, there is an <br>entrepreneur who is waiting to identify a window of opportunity in the entire tourism value chain. This is <br>called the tourism production process. The tourism product is the result of a complex production process. The <br>process begins w ith primary inputs of resources, raw materials and other components such as construction <br>material, fuel and agricultural p roduct to create the facilities and equipment needed by the tourism industry. <br>These are then converted through additional processing, manufacturing or construction into intermediate <br>inputs or tourism facilities. Intermediate inputs include attractions such  as national parks, museums, galleries, <br>historic sites and convention centres, as well as tourism support and facilities such as hotel s, restaurants, gift <br>shops and car rental companies. The intermediate inputs are further refined through managerial expert ise, <br>technical services, scheduling and packaging into intermediate outputs. Intermediate outputs are those services <br>normally associat ed with the tourism industry such as commercial accommodation, tour services, food <br>services and festivals. In the final st ages, the tourist utilises the intermediate outputs (services) to generate the <br>final output: intangible but highly valued experiences such as recreation, business and social contacts as noted <br>by Smith (1994). The tourism product offering is essentially a s ervice that is simultaneously produced and <br>consumed, in as much as the product offering is a service, which has physical attributes th at are necessary for <br>the delivery of the service aspects of the product to be performable. Tourism provides a unique conte xt in <br>which to examine the function and purpose of an entrepreneurial network as a catalyst through which small <br>289 <br> businesses work togeth er in a cooperative manner to achieve destination synergies. Services are defined by <br>Wilson, Zeithaml, Bitner and Gremler (2012) as all economic activities whose output is not a physical product <br>or construction, is generally consumed at the time it is prod uced, and provides added value in forms (such as <br>convenience, amusement, timeliness, comfort or health) that are necessary  intangible concerns of its first <br>purchaser.  <br>“The tourism industry is highly dependent on guest experiences with respect to customer service and delight” <br>(Mohsin, Ramli & Alkhulayfi, 2015). Customer service, therefore, becomes paramount in the delivery of the <br>tourism product offering, which includes service and product attributes. Kotler, Bowen and Makens (2006) <br>explain that in today’s hospitality/travel industry, the customer is global and is king or queen. Customer service <br>is defined by Hudson and Hudson (2013) as the practice of delivering products  and services to both internal <br>and external customers via the efforts of employees or through the provision of appropriate servicescapes. <br>Hudson and Hudson (2013) acknowledge that customer service is increasingl y becoming a differentiator in <br>this sector. I n the analysis of the tourism product offering, which is unique when compared to physical <br>products, much attention has been given to the service elements against the physical attributes.  <br>Equal importance must be  placed by entrepreneurs on both the physical  attributes (which are tangible) and the <br>service attributes (which are intangible) of the tourism product offering. The tourism product offering has <br>unique characteristics  and physical evidence is one of the thr ee of the extended marketing mix, which inclu des <br>people, physical evidence and process. Because of the intangible nature of the tourism product offering, the <br>physical evidence becomes a form of “proof” of the nature and character of the service that will s imultaneously <br>be performed and consumed. Serv ice marketers should make an effort to provide their prospective customers <br>with evidence that will help make the services tangible. Promotional materials, employees’ appearance, and <br>the service firm’s physical e nvironment all help to do so. Everything abou t a hospitality company <br>communicates something (Kotler, Bowen & Makens, 2006). Therefore, the physical elements of the tourism <br>product offering attain greater importance when compared to manufactured products th at do not share the <br>unique characteristics of  services. The physical attributes of the tourism product offering can be successfully <br>used by an entrepreneur to tangibilise the tourism product offering. This can be related to the fact that <br>tangibilising is t he process of adding “evidence” and “proof” i n the physical attributes to give evidence and <br>proof to the customers of the service they will receive, which they can’t measure before the simultaneous <br>production and consumption of the service.  <br>The tangible as pects of the physical attributes of the touri sm product offering are therefore available for <br>scrutiny by the customers as an indication of the service that they will receive, when the service is delivered. <br>Servicescape refers to the use of physical evidenc e to design the service environment and accor ding to George <br>(2014) includes three types of servicescape: self -service, remote service and interpersonal service.  <br>Table 17.1 Elements of physical evidence  <br>External servicescape  Interior servicescape  Other tang ibles  <br>• Signature  <br>• Landscape  <br>• Parking  <br>• Exterior design  • Signage  <br>• Air temperature  <br>• Lighting  <br>• Design  <br>• Layout  <br>• Seating  <br>• Décor  • Business cards  <br>• Invoices  <br>• Stationery  <br>• Website pages  <br>• Employees’ dress  <br>• Brochures  <br>Source:  George (2014)  <br> <br> 290 <br> What is explicit is that physical attributes of the tourism product offering are a form of communication to <br>consumers. The communication can be the physical attributes communicating either positively or negatively <br>about the quality of the service. Kotler, Bowen and Makens (2006) note that physical ev idence not managed <br>properly can hurt a business and that physical surroundings should be designed to reinforce the product’s <br>position in the customer’s mind. It is imperative that businesses review all aspects o f the physical environment <br>and servicescapes from time to time to ensure that they deliver the desired and desirable organisational image <br>to current and prospective customers. Kotler et al. (2006) note that tangibles provide signals as to the quality <br>of th e intangibles. They also explain that a servi ce culture focuses on serving and satisfying the customers. <br>Creating a service culture has to start with top management and flow down. A service culture empowers <br>employees to solve customer problems. It is suppo rted by a reward system based on customer sat isfaction. <br>People generally do what is rewarded. If an organisation wants to deliver a quality product, the organisation’s <br>culture must support and reward attention to customer needs. Wilson et al. (2012) assert  that services are <br>deeds, processes and perfo rmances. Therefore, the performance of employees in the delivery of superior <br>customer service depends on the company having a supportive culture that allows employees to deliver <br>exceptional customer service. The  service elements of the tourism product offe ring aim to ensure that <br>customers are amazed by the service delivery that is intangible, perishable, variable and inseparable. <br>Entrepreneurs must understand that physical attributes are the initial aspect of ins pection by customers when <br>trying to gather ev idence about the service delivery of the tourism product offering. Therefore the physical <br>product offerings must reinforce the service that will be delivered. Entrepreneurs must acknowledge that when <br>the service  is delivered, everything must be in order so  that the service delivery is flawless, with the <br>unapologetic intention to amaze and satisfy customers. The intention of service delivery is to ensure customer <br>satisfaction and thereby customer loyalty to the co mpany, which results in positive word -of-mout h about the <br>experience. This is increasingly important in a world where social media has placed the power in the hands of <br>the consumers as they  make their experiences known on platforms such as TripAdvisor.  <br> <br>17.5 NATURE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF TOURISM SERVI CES FOR ENTREPRENEURS <br>IN EMERGING ECONOMIES  <br>There is an essential difference between goods and services, in that the services are performed (consumption <br>economy) while goods are produced (production economy). Ac cording to Middleton and Clarke (2001) goods <br>are products purchased through an exchange transaction conferring ownership of a physical item that may be <br>used or consumed at the owner’s choice of time and place. Services are products purchased through an <br>exchange transaction that does not confer owners hip but permits access to and use of a service, usually at a <br>specific time in a specific place. This therefore means that the consumption of the tourism product offering is <br>timespecific, and entrepreneurs must c learly understand this reality. The productio n and consumption are <br>simultaneous, where the patrons are part of the service offering, as consumption is under time constraints. For <br>example, when a customer purchases an airline ticket, the ticket will be for a particular flight, at a particular <br>time and  from a particular airport.  <br>Tourism product offerings are different from manufactured products in that tourism product offerings are <br>services and therefore have a different set of characteristics. According to George (2014), tourism marketers <br>need to be co ncerned with four generic ch aracteristics that make the marketing of service offerings different <br>from the marketing of manufactured products: intangibility, inseparability, variability and perishability.  <br>17.5.1 Intangibility  <br>The tourism product offering ca nnot be touched, smelled and  tasted before it is simultaneously produced and <br>consumed. The patrons only become aware of the service during the production and consumption process. <br>Kotler et al. (2006) note that unlike physical products, services cannot be s een, tasted, felt, heard or smelled 291 <br> before they are purchased. Before a consumer buys a motor car, he or she can inspect it. The patrons may rely <br>on physical evidence to gauge the experience during the service offering. The tourism product offering has <br>physical attributes that are a prerequisite to produce the intangible service attributes, and may be relied upon <br>as a form of proof of the service that will be produced. According to George (2014), the tourism offering is <br>an experience rather than a physical product. The consumers will depend on the physical attributes of the <br>tourism product offering and the servicescapes as an indication of the service that they will receive, when it is <br>simultaneously produced and consumed. Hudson and Hudson (2013) state that  to reduce uncertainty cause d <br>by the intangibility of services, buyers look for tangible evidence to provide information and confidence about <br>the service.  <br>Table 17.2 Generic characteristics distinguishing services from goods  <br>Goods  Services  <br>• Are manufacture d <br>• Made in premises not norma lly open to <br>customers (separable)  <br>• Goods are delivered to places where customers <br>live <br>• Purchase conveys ownership and right to use at <br>purchaser’s own convenience  <br>• Goods possess tangible form at the point of sale <br>and can be inspecte d prior to sale  <br>• Stocks of pr oducts can be created and held for <br>future sale  • Are performed  <br>• Performed on the producer’s premises, with full <br>participation by the consumer (inseparable)  <br>• Customers travel to places where the service is <br>delivered  <br>• Purchase confers temporary rights of access at a <br>prearranged place and time  <br>• Services are intangible at the point of sale; often <br>cannot be inspected (other than “virtually”)  <br>• Perishable; services cann ot be inventoried and <br>stocks of product cannot be held  <br>Source:  Middleton &  Clarke (2001)  <br>17.5.1.1 Resulting implications of intangibility  <br>Wilson et al. (2012) note that intangibility presents several marketing challenges. Services cannot be patented <br>easily, and new service concepts can therefore easily be copied  by competitors. Services cannot be readily <br>displayed or easily communicated to customers, so quality may be difficult for consumers to assess. Hudson <br>and Hudson (2013) comment that services cannot be inventoried and therefore fluctuations in demand are <br>difficult to manage , particularly in the accommodation and airline sectors. According to Middleton and Clarke <br>(2001), intangibility requires careful consideration by marketing managers of travel and t ourism products. <br>Entrepreneurs must utilise social media to make their serv ice offerings tangible by capturing testimonials of <br>customer experiences, and encouraging customers to comment on social media about them. This is a form of <br>online positive word -of-mouth advertising, which includes high -quality pictures taken using smartph ones.  <br>17.5.2 Perishability  <br>Tourism product offerings are simultaneously produced and consumed, which means that the consumers are <br>part of the tourism product offering as they play a  role in the delivery of the service they have bought. Mass <br>production of s ervices is almost impossible, because the tourism product offering is simultaneously produced <br>and consumed. According to Wilson et al. (2012), the quality of service and customer sa tisfaction will be <br>highly dependent on what happens in “real time” includin g actions of employees and the interactions between <br>employees and customers. For example, enthusiastic customers at a restaurant will generally receive good <br>quality service because of the energy they exhibit, while the opposite is also true. This means tha t customers <br>are coproducers of the service they receive and can contribute to their own satisfaction or dissatisfaction when <br>service is delivered. It must be bought to mind that the  physical tangible attributes provide a supporting and <br>facilitating role fo r the delivery of the service attributes of the tourism product offering. The service attributes <br>require as a pre -requisite that the service provider and the customer are present so  that the service can be 292 <br> performed. Because of this peculiar nature of serv ices, the production of the service cannot be stored, as it <br>requires the presence of the customer and the service provider so that simultaneous production and <br>consumption can occur.  The absence of either the service provider and/or the client will make it impossible <br>for the service delivery to occur, as the tourism product offering is simultaneously produced and consumed.  <br>17.5.2.1 Resulting implication of perishability  <br>Wilson et al. (2012) explain that the primary issue that marketers face in relation to se rvice perishability is the <br>inability to hold stock. For tourism product offerings that are simultaneously produced and consumed, the <br>production process occurs on customer demand, wh ich means that stock build -up cannot occur. This means <br>that entrepreneurs m ust balance supply and demand when producing tourism product offerings. In addition, <br>because of the perishable nature of tourism product offerings, entrepreneurs must ensure that a lot of effort is <br>invested in marketing outlays so as to reduce the perishab ility of slow -moving tourism product offerings.  <br>17.5.3 Heterogeneity (variability)  <br>Hudson and Hudson (2013) state that service -delivery quality depends on who provides the service. The same <br>person can deliver different levels of service. According to Saaym an (2013) the standardisation of the tourism <br>product is difficult to achieve, as people participate in the delivery of the tourism product offering. People <br>involved in the productio n of the tourism product offering deliver various levels of service. In add ition, <br>because customers are participators in the service -delivery system, the enthusiasm of the customer can have a <br>positive impact on the service they receive, while the opposite is also true. Heightened demand that outstrips <br>supply may lead to dissatisf action as the service delivery of the product may not occur in line with <br>expectations.  <br>17.5.3.1 Implication of heterogeneity (variability)  <br>George (2014) expresses that variability is perhaps the most challenging of the characteristics of a service. <br>Accordi ng to Wilson et al. (2012), services are heterogeneous across time,  organisations and people; therefore <br>ensuring consistent service quality  is challenging. Technology has been a welcome addition since it has <br>reduced the challenges linked to heterogeneity. This is because businesses can now access online booking, <br>rather than booking by telephone, which used to cause a great deal of dissatisfac tion in customers. Managing <br>supply and demand is critical to managing variability. Staff members must be continually trained in order to <br>build staff competence so that customer satisfaction can be managed during times of heightened demand.  <br>17.5.4 Inseparab ility <br>The tourism product offering that is simultaneously produced and consumed can only be produced when <br>supply and demand are synchronised. This means the service provider and the customers must be present for <br>the service to be produced and consumed. The  service provider and patrons are coproducers of the service that <br>is intangible, which means that the service -deliver y process is inseparable. According to George (2014) <br>services are usually sold first and then created and consumed at the same time. For ex ample, an airline seat <br>cannot be provided until it has been purchased and the flying experience is produced and consu med <br>simultaneously. Hudson and Hudson (2013) state that the product cannot be created or delivered without the <br>customer’s presence.  <br>17.5.4. 1 Implication of inseparability  <br>Wilson et al. (2012) explain that because services are often produced and consumed at  the same time, mass <br>production is difficult. This means that the act of production and consumption is simultaneous, and supply <br>and demand should be synchronised. The production of the tourism product offering requires the active <br>participation of the produ cer and consumer together. This means that the service provider must manage supply <br>and demand so that service delivery is seamless. In rese arch conducted by Henama and Sifolo (2017b), Uber, 293 <br> the technology disruptor, has managed to match supply and demand f or taxi services far better than metered <br>taxi drivers, leading to increased trips for Uber and hence more money for this company.  <br>17.6 THE ROLE OF PEOPLE IN THE TOURISM PRODUCTION PROCESS  <br>People play a role as producers of the tourism product offering firs tly as staff who deliver the service elements, <br>and secondly as tourists who experience the tourism product offering. According to Smith (19 94), the structure <br>of the tourism product is complex and it is the result of a complicated production process. People  are <br>coproducers as staff and tourists. Middleton and Clarke (2001) comment that the people component of the <br>tourism product offering inclu des the following:  <br>• Visitors:  the individual consumers of the product and the other tourists present at the same time and place  <br>• Employees:  the staff of an organisation can be subdivided into front -line members with visitor contact and <br>non-contact employees who provide support  <br>• Host community:  the residents of a destination community who may not regard themselves as part of  the <br>tourism business, but who nonetheless interact with visitors informally and whose friendly or hostile <br>behaviour can make or mar the vi sitor’s experience.  <br>The tourism product offering requires that the consumers’ interactions with the service -delivery system are <br>managed, in the same way that customers interact with other customers. Customers are coproducers, which <br>means that the interacti on between patrons must be managed so that patrons do not negatively affect each <br>other’s experiences. According to Mi ddleton and Clarke (2001), customers go through a series of encounters. <br>These include face -to-face communication with employees but also re mote interactions via email, websites <br>and social media platforms. Employees in the tourism product offering play an i mportant role, therefore much <br>investment in training and retraining is imperative to ensure that staff members remain relevant. The <br>integra tion of technology to assist service delivery is imperative, such as movie theatres having Point -of-Sale <br>(POS) outlet s where patrons can pay for movie tickets using POS machinery instead of depending on joining <br>a queue to access tickets. Dieke (2013) ackno wledges that there is a relationship between  tourism <br>production  and tourism consumption . Tourism production relates t o the supply -side: dimensions that “pull” <br>tourists to areas including accommodation, amenities, ease of reaching the destination, culture and so on. <br>Tourism consumption concerns the touristic demand determinants, which influence the volume and directions <br>of travel flows.  <br>17.7 WHY TOURISM AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP?  <br>Tourism is an important industry that can change and diversify the economic fortunes of a city, country and <br>continent. Tourism in the tertiary sector is critical as the world economy is moving towards services that are <br>highly sought after. Ferreira (2007) explains that there are unrealistic expectations regarding the role of <br>tourism in fulfilling the economic growth mechanism for a town. Tourism will succeed when a confluence is <br>achieved of high amenity  attractions, innovation, investors, good municipal governance, tourism <br>infrastructure, appropriate services and skilled labour. The tourism industry is dominated by SMMEs, possibly <br>because tourism entrepreneurship demands low start -up capital.  <br>Tourism ent repreneurship begins with innovation (which is affected by several triggers, as indicated in  Figure <br>17.3). <br> <br> 294 <br> Figure 17.3 Entrepreneurial triggers  <br> <br>Source:  Adapted from Hattem (1997)  <br> <br>These triggers have an influence on the creativity of a tourism entrepreneur. The model of entrepreneurship <br>and small business development explains the  facets of growing a business and harvesting a business venture. <br>The entrepreneur does not need strong ac ademic qualifications and professional experience to operate in the <br>tourism business; it is easy to situate the tourism enterprise locally where there is a demand for the product <br>and service. Entrepreneurs grab an opportunity to run a small business operat ion as a family business, which <br>is the lifeblood of the economy. For this reason, the entrepreneurship associated with small businesses  is <br>regarded as a key vehicle for the creation of new enterprises as it generates job growth and stimulates <br>competition ( Rusu, Csorba, Cureteanu & Isac, 2014).  <br>17.7.1 Balance of payments  <br>Celik, Ozcan, Topcuoglu and Yildirim (2013) state that tourism plays an important rol e in the campaign <br>against the balance of payments. Their findings indicate that the increase in tourism r evenues had led to a <br>decrease in the balance of payments deficit. According to Wall and Mathieson (2006), the potential <br>contribution of tourism to the balance of payments as an earner of foreign exchange has been recognised, and <br>countries have escaped bala nce of payments problems by using tourism to attract foreign exchange. Tourism <br>can therefore ensure that a country attracts more trade receipts; this h as been a strategy used by many island <br>economies from Cuba to Mauritius, where their trade has been diver sified towards tourism from sugar cane.  <br>295 <br> 17.7.2 Foreign -exchange earner  <br>Tourism is a good source of foreign exchange. According to Henama (2013), the to urism industry is an export <br>industry because the tourism product offering is consumed at the destination area. Foreign exchange is earned <br>at the destination as the consumption of the tourism product offering can only occur at the destination because <br>of fix ed location characteristics. Foreign exchange for a developing country serves as an important facet as <br>far as the export earnings are concerned. Foreign exchange also contributes towards the savings of the country, <br>which in turn may be available for invest ment and growth. International tourism spending is an important <br>export sector and makes a significant con tribution to overall export revenues around the world, according to <br>the World Travel and Tourism Council (2014). Countries rely on tourism to attract f oreign exchange because <br>it is almost impossible to impose trade barriers on tourism. According to Strauss  and Lord (2001), the primary <br>force behind tourism is the volume and expenditure from non -residents, which represent an influx of new <br>money into a regi onal economy through the export of recreational services. According to Henama and Sifolo <br>(2017a), tourism  had been adopted by the Bretton Woods institutions because it represents part of export <br>growth in line with the neo -liberal agenda best known as the W ashington Consensus. Tourism is accepted as <br>an economic sector that brings about jobs and foreign exchang e for the developed and developing world; it <br>has been incorporated into the economic development policies of almost all countries in the world. Tourism  <br>remains an attractor of foreign exchange par excellence.  <br>17.7.3 Sharing of infrastructure  <br>Infrastructure  that is created for tourism is shared with locals, which means that infrastructure extension for <br>tourism serves two market segments. According to Wall  and Mathieson (2006), tourist development brings <br>about improvements to local infrastructure, services an d facilities that benefits both residents and tourists. It <br>may also stimulate the protection of local natural resources that are often the attraction o f the developing <br>destination. Saayman, Saayman and Rhodes (2001) explain that an increase in the number o f tourists visiting <br>a province or region such as can be achieved by promoting domestic tourism leads to a growth in the demand <br>for local products and s ervices. It also creates a demand for investments in infrastructure and superstructure. <br>The growth of tou rists at a destination can pressure the state to improve infrastructure such as road <br>transportation and airport infrastructure, benefiting business and  citizens with faster transport networks. <br>According to Giampiccoli, Lee and Nauright (2013), the Eastern Cape province of South Africa spent R250 <br>million upgrading sports stadiums in Nelson Mandela Bay, East London and Mthatha for the 2010 World Cup. <br>Ginsb erg (2010) comments that for the 1999 All African Games held in Johannesburg, an athletes’ village <br>was co nstructed in Alexandra, which was later converted into low -cost housing stock at the end of the event. <br>The high -speed train network provided by the Gau train is enjoyed by tourists and citizens of South Africa, <br>with tourists dominating service usage during off-peak periods.  <br>17.7.4 Fragmentation and the cross -cutting nature of the tourism industry  <br>The purchase of the tourism product offering is associated with the purchase of an assortment  of products and <br>services produced by several producers. The tourism in dustry is characterised by fragmentation. According to <br>Burton (1999) the tourism industry is fragmented, made up of many different businesses, each sup plying part <br>of the service. Fragmentation demands a much closer working relationship between the various members of <br>the value chain. Akinboade and Braimoh (2010) acknowledge that tourism is distinct from other sectors; it is <br>a cross -cutting sector and it i nvolves a big diversity of services and professions. It is linked to many other <br>economic activities and p olicy areas, and is made up of five different sectors. These are accommodation; food <br>and beverage services; recreation and entertainment; transportatio n, and travel services. The fragmented <br>nature of tourism can be beneficial to employment in the industry and ensures that the tourist expenditure <br>injection can be shared by more entrepreneurs. Tourism linkages to other economic sectors are diverse and <br>deep  according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (2010). This means that the <br>growth o f tourism at a destination, for example, can increase the order book for construction companies, which <br>must upgrade tourist accommodation and build add itional hotel stock.  296 <br> 17.7.5 Taxation of non -residents  <br>Tourism creates an opportunity for a country to tax  non-residents, which would increase the tax coffers of the <br>state. Governments throughout the world always seek ways to increase their tax base, as any  intention to raise <br>additional taxes from residents is usually met with civic resistance. Tourists at the  destination would normally <br>not pay taxes, and in certain cases there would be additional taxation imposed on tourists, which would <br>increase the tax co ffers of the state. Wall and Mathieson (2006) comment that income from tourism for <br>government arises from : direct taxation, mainly on tourist manpower, tourism and transport enterprises, user <br>fees and service charges; from indirect taxation from customs du ties and on goods consumed by tourists; and <br>from payments. Airport taxation for international flights is usually more expensive, which is used to build and <br>maintain airport infrastructure.  <br>17.7.6 Improved national image  <br>According to Christie, Fernandes, Me sserli and Twining -Ward (2014), successful tourism can change external <br>perceptions of a country, improve intercultural understanding and create a positive internal frame of reference <br>for a country. The improved national image can increase foreign direct in vestment and improve the receptive <br>nature of the host population to tourists, improving the tourism exper ience. By hosting a successful 2010 FIFA <br>World Cup, South Africa managed to attain a positive image, which benefited tourism. In addition, the <br>apprecia tion that tourists show when they visit a destination can result in local residents developing and <br>improv ing pride in their country as they realise that it is of value to tourists. This increase in pride by locals <br>can have a positive knock -on effect on the  tourism industry as locals become friendlier to tourists and improve <br>the local tourist interactions, whi ch tourists value highly.  <br>17.7.7 Tourism resilience  <br>Globally, tourism is a $3 billion -a-day business that all countries at all levels of development ca n potentially <br>benefit from. International tourism has grown consistently, from 25 million in 1950 to 922 million in 2009 as <br>noted by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (2010). South Africa’s tourism growth <br>rate for 2016 was 13 per cent,  which was impressive, when you compare this to the dismal economic growth <br>prospects of the country. The tourism industry’s growth has not just been impressive, it has been resilient. <br>Tourism is resilient to economic crises and tragic events such as 9/11, and besides a temporary reduction in <br>demand, always bounces back. In research conducted by Hajibaba, Gret zel, Leisch and Dolnicar (2015), the <br>authors noted the emergence of crisis -resistant tourists, who visit a destination despite events such as a terrori st <br>attack. This is a reflection of our times where such acts are the new normal.  <br>17.7.8 Improving intern ational ties and a force for peace  <br>The promotion of tourism and the exchange of tourists between countries can enhance political and cultural <br>links, acc ording to George (2014). This is because tourism is trade between countries,  which may require state <br>relations in the visa regulations and the allocation of reciprocal aviation access between countries. Tourism is <br>a vital force for peace, as it requires pe ace as a prerequisite for growth and development. Improving the <br>personal safety and security of the host  community will improve the experience for tourists, because resources <br>are shared by tourists and residents. The increased safety procedures for tourist s benefit locals; increased <br>policing demands a functioning state, which is a good indicator of governanc e. <br>17.7.9 Wealth distribution  <br>The majority of tourists originate from developed countries where there is an institutionalised culture of <br>tourism consump tion, and who increasingly travel to developing countries as tourists. Cohen (1972) comments <br>that the ma jority of tourists originate today from affluent Western countries, the US, Western Europe and <br>increasingly from Japan. Countries such as China and Indi a have increased their share of outbound tourism as <br>they have benefited from increased wealth – a testam ent to their decade -long economic growth trajectory. The <br>high rate of urbanisation has led to the development of rural sites for tourism consumption, le ading to an <br>urban –rural migration of tourism expenditure, benefiting the local rural economy. This has m anifested in the 297 <br> development of second homes in rural and peri -rural settings, which provide an escape from the urbanised <br>cities for an increasing numbe r of city dwellers. The consumption economy of tourism occurs at the destination <br>area, which means that tourism transfers wealth from the rich developed nation into developing nations. <br>Within countries, tourists who visit the coastal areas of the country d uring the holidays ensure that money is <br>distributed as a result of the tourism consumption process. The contribution of tourists to the economy must <br>be retained to ensure maximum benefit. This is premised on developing the tourism industry on pro -poor <br>principles, thereby seeking to reduce leakage from the economy.  <br>17.7.10 Local beneficiation  <br>Tourism is a resource that cannot be shipped offshore as noted by Hollenhorst, Houge -Mckenzie and Ostergren <br>(2014). The tourism product offering is a service with tangi ble physical aspects and is simultaneously <br>produced and cons umed at the destination, allowing opportunities for local beneficiation. According to Zhang, <br>Song and Huang (2009), tourists travel to the destinations where tourism products are produced to consu me <br>these products. The inseparable nature of tourism product  offerings results in the production and consumption <br>occurring at the destination area, where the majority of the value -adding occurs. Value adding and local <br>beneficiation at the destination canno t occur unless the tourism industry is developed on pro -poor principles, <br>which ensures that the majority of the tourism expenditure is spent on locally owned enterprises. Pro -poor <br>tourism seeks to ensure local beneficiation, which can improve the quality o f life and standard of living of <br>locals.  <br>17.7.11 Smokeless i ndustry  <br>In today’s global world many countries pay attention to the tourism industry, the so -called “industry without <br>a chimney”. Tourism contributes to global emissions as it is depends on aviati on to provide transportation to <br>and from the destination, an d the automobile is used at the destination for ground transportation. However, <br>the contribution of tourism to global emissions remains small compared to the pollution contribution of <br>mining, manu facturing and agriculture. According to Hollenhorst, Houge -Mckenzie and Ostergren (2014), <br>unlike primary resources such as coal and minerals, tourism is not finite. Tourism planning must ensure that <br>the destination finds a balance between tourism growth an d carrying capacity management, limiting the <br>negative enviro nmental impacts of tourism.  <br>17.7.12 Trade barriers  <br>It is almost impossible to set up trade barriers against tourism because it is not a physical product but a service. <br>According to Kwaramba (2012) , unlike trade in goods, trade in services occurs not only t hrough the cross -<br>border movement of the services, but through the movement of persons (consumers and individual service <br>providers) and foreign investment. According to Cooper et al. (2008), the co nsumers of international tourism <br>(the importing country) oft en fail to recognise their tourist spending overseas as an import and  hence do not <br>see it as a serious threat to the level of employment in their own countries. Tourism is therefore an industry <br>that does not have trade barriers and can be used by countries  as a means of attracting foreign exchange. <br>Countries that seek to attract tourists must ensure that they promote aviation access, have a friendly visa system <br>and manage their image as a destinati on. <br>17.7.13 Labour -intensive jobs  <br>The tourism product offeri ng, which is essentially services that must be simultaneously produced and <br>consumed, requires coproduction by the consumer and the service provider. This means that the growth of <br>tourism at a dest ination leads to increased tourism production, which, in tur n, leads to a growth in labour -<br>intensive jobs. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (2010), tourism is a <br>highly labour -intensive activity, tourism and tourism -suppor t activities create a high proportion of <br>employment and care er opportunities for low -skilled and semi -skilled workers, particularly for poor, female <br>and young workers. The characteristics of the tourism sector are visible in entrepreneurship. Shaw (2004) <br>asserts that the goal of entrepreneurship goes beyond profit maximisation to issues such as improving quality 298 <br> of life, the social status of innovation and copyright ownership, among others. Gibson (2009) comments that <br>tourism has drawn workers to the sites of tourism booms. This has the benefit of attracting skilled  professionals <br>and opportunity entrepreneurs. According to Christie et al. (2014), one in 20 jobs in sub -Saharan Africa is <br>already in travel and tourism. Countries that promote tourism seek to ben efit from an industry that creates a <br>plethora of entry -level  jobs, which reduces dependence on traditional employment sectors such as mining, <br>agriculture and manufacturing, which are perennial job shedders.  <br>17.7.14 Promotes entrepreneurship and low barrier s to entry  <br>According to the Department of Environmental Affa irs and Tourism (1996), the tourism industry supports a <br>thriving and dynamic informal sector that involves previously disadvantaged groups in areas such as <br>entertainment, laundry and transport ser vices. These are the areas of the tourism industry that have  low barriers <br>to entry, which can promote an easy entry into entrepreneurship. Tourism employs a multiplicity of skills <br>because of its cross -cutting nature, which means it promotes entrepreneurshi p directly and indirectly. McKay <br>(2013) acknowledged that li festyle entrepreneurs are able to function as business catalysts. Lifestyle <br>entrepreneurship has the potential to become a non -binding introduction into the world of entrepreneurship as <br>lifestyle entrepreneurs are involved in business to substitute their i ncome while business growth is not a major <br>objective. According to Christie et al. (2014), tourism compares well with other sectors regarding the <br>opportunities for small and medium enterprises. Th e disruption created by technology operators such as Uber <br>and Airbnb has meant that there is a class of tourism entrepreneurs who provide services such as taxi services <br>(Uber) and Airbnb (accommodation), both of which are forms of franchises that create li festyle entrepreneurs.  <br>17.7.15 Growth sector  <br>According to th e United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (2010: 2): “International tourist <br>arrivals have grown consistently, from 25 million in 1950 to 922 million in 2008, with tourism receipts risin g <br>from $2billion to $944 billion.” The desire to travel has become universal, while Africa continues to receive <br>less than 10 per cent of global tourism receipts. According to Rogerson (2012: 6), “between 1990 and 2010 <br>international tourism arrivals in Sout h Africa expanded eightfold”. Tourism is a way of life and a dopted as a <br>form of lifestyle, which has a positive impact on tourism consumption. As global wealth increases, more <br>people are participating in tourism consumption, as tourism consumption is part of a broader consumer culture. <br>“With the development of the economy, people earn more and have more leisure time, tourism has become a <br>kind of fashion,” says Lui (2013: 68).  <br>17.7.16 Tourism multipliers  <br>Tourism expenditure is able to become a catalyst for o ther industries as a result of the initial tourism <br>expendit ure that is introduced in the destination economy. Cooper et al. (2008) state that the  concept of the <br>multiplier is based upon the recognition that sales in one firm require purchase from other fir ms within the <br>local economy. The other firms can include fa rmers who produce food, transport providers that transport <br>tourists and construction firms that have increased demand to upgrade and build new commercial tourist <br>accommodation. The increased demand  generated by tourism in the tertiary sector of the economy  means that <br>it creates jobs also in the secondary and primary sector of the economy. According to Wall and Mathieson <br>(2006) the income multiplier considers three types of influences of tourist expe nditures:  <br>• Direct spending:  the initial expenditure creates direct revenue to hoteliers, service stations and other tourist <br>industries supplying goods and services directly to tourists.  <br>• Indirect spending:  this results from the payment of salaries and wages to local employees and tourist <br>establishments replenishing their stocks, and the indirect effects of the initial, direct tourist expenditure.  <br>• Induced spending:  as wages and salaries within an economy rise as a result of initial changes in final <br>demand, loc al consumption also increases. This re -spending of increased income provides an additional <br>impetus for economic activity.  299 <br> 17.7.17 Tourism increases happiness an d quality of life  <br>According to Nawijn, Marchand, Veenhoven and Vingerhoets (2010), from an indiv idual point of view <br>vacationing is something which is looked forward to. People derive more happiness from two or more short <br>breaks spread throughout the year t han having just a single longer holiday once a year. By undertaking a <br>journey away from home, th eir work and routine, tourists seek an escape and this may increase their happiness <br>levels, and improve their quality of life. Dolnicar, Yanamadram and Cliff (2 012) explain that holidays <br>contribute to quality of life (QOL) and there is a difference between  leisure at home and away from home. In <br>research conducted by Acha -Anyi (2015), the author notes that the social -exchange theory that residents are <br>more likely to support tourism development if they see how they stand to benefit from it. “The tourism indus try <br>is supposed to increase the standard of living of locals. QOL of the host community must be improved by <br>tourism employment and supply chain opportunities th at will ensure that the benefits are retained in the local <br>economy” (Henama & Sifolo, 2017a). En trepreneurs must embed their marketing outlays with information <br>that the taking of holiday increases happiness, and the pursuit of happiness can be achieved thr ough tourism <br>consumption away from home. Destinations must ensure that tourism satisfaction is g uaranteed throughout <br>the stages of the travel trip, through the use of mystery guests, staff training and engagement with the tourism <br>industry.  <br>17.8 CRITICAL SU CCESS FACTORS  <br>17.8.1 Transformation  <br>Transformation in South Africa is a business imperative to e nsure that the wealth of the nation is shared. The <br>transformation of the tourism industry requires that more black South Africans become institutionalised <br>tourism consumers, and that there is an i ncrease in the number of black tourism product owners. As a result, <br>transformation will lead to an increase of entrepreneurs in general, particularly in the tourism sector. <br>According to Rusu, Csorba, Cureteanu and Isac (2014), tourism entrepreneurs have th e opportunity to catalyse <br>the situation and offer close cont act with local communities and traditions in an area while at the same time <br>transforming local resources into high -quality tourism products/services. Research conducted by Rogerson <br>(2007) acknowle dges that the adventure industry’s employment patterns are d ominated by whites, and in <br>certain activities, such as surfing, skydiving, rafting and kloofing, nearly all the jobs are occupied by whites. <br>According to Rogerson and Lisa (2005), historically, a key factor in the underdevelopment of black tourism <br>was the lack of knowledge among new travellers about tourism, the lack of marketing of tourism products <br>among black consumers, and absence of information about how to travel. Access to finance has been id entified <br>as the major stumbling block to the growth of touri sm enterprises and possibly more so for the black survivalist <br>enterprises. Growing the share of black tourism product owners is important so that the tourism  industry <br>increases the accrual of bene fits from tourism. South Africa must ensure that it increase s access to finance <br>from developmental agencies of the state at rates that are lower than banking institutions as a means of <br>catalysing entrepreneurial activity. Government involvement in the tour ism sector through transformation <br>activities such as tourism  awards improves and embraces entrepreneurship.  <br>17.8.2 Government support  <br>The biggest stumbling block to the growth of tourism in South Africa is the state at all three levels, national, <br>provincia l and local government. Local government has been identified  as possibly the biggest obstacle in the <br>provision of services and infrastructure that will support the growth of tourism. Local government in South <br>Africa is in a state of crisis, and it fails in  its constitutional responsibility in the provision of munic ipal services <br>such as refuse removal, quality drinking water provision and cleaning and upkeep of municipal recreational <br>facilities. The state must provide an enabling environment that will allow the private sector to grow the tourism <br>economy. The state mu st play a leading role in working with the private sector to establish a Tourism Red 300 <br> Tape Initiative® (TRTI), which would provide an institutional framework where binding decisions are taken, <br>and diversions can be tracked.  <br>17.8.3 Safety and security  <br>Person al safety and security are prerequisites for the development of tourism in the world today. Safety and <br>security is an important purchase criterion for South Africa’s target consumers in all its co re markets. The <br>perceptions and concerns that consumers have  around safety are major challenges that South Africa faces as <br>a tourist destination. In fact, a large proportion of tourists from our target markets choose not to come to South <br>Africa because of safety concerns, according to the Department of Environmenta l Affairs and Tourism (2005). <br>Destinations that seek to develop tourism must be proactive and have in place a tourism crisis management <br>plan for times of crisis. In the case of South Africa, the s uccessful hosting of the 2010 FIFA World Cup created <br>a posit ive image, while the perennial acts of xenophobia give the country a bad image for tourists. It is <br>necessary that South Africa create a special category of Tourism Police under the South African P olice Service <br>(SAPS) that will focus on tourists.  <br>17.8.4 Vis a facilitation  <br>The visa regulations of a country are one of the most important determinants of tourism demand to a country. <br>Tourists consider the visa regulations of a destination, in comparison w ith other destinations, when taking a <br>decision as to which d estination to visit. Therefore, tourism demand can be directly linked to the visa <br>regulations of a country. Visa -free travel has proven to simplify the ability to do business and stimulate <br>tourism , especially multiple entries. Because of the red tape assoc iated with visa acquisition, this dampens the <br>potential for “spur -of-the-moment” decision to travel to a destination. As more countries introduce visa -free <br>travel, African economies have been slow  in increasing visa facilitation, limiting the developmental  potential <br>of tourism. The visa system of a country is the most important government policy that can stimulate tourism <br>growth into country.  <br>17.8.5 Aviation access  <br>The advent of low -cost carriers ( LCCs) not only increased travel in the world, it also led to  mode switching <br>from less time -effective transport systems towards commercial aviation. This was a catalyst for the growth of <br>the commercial aviation market, especially acting as a catalyst for a whole new market segment that had never <br>flown before. The em ergence of LCCs led to the development of secondary airports and this benefited <br>commerce and people. South Africa is a long -haul destination, which means that it takes longer to arrive, <br>hence more  flights to South Africa must be encouraged. More flights me an more tourists, and more tourists <br>mean less poverty, unemployment and inequality, the triple challenges South Africa faces in addition to an <br>economy that is not growing. Air access remains the m ajor challenge that limits the growth of tourism in South <br>Africa. <br>17.8.6 Institutionalisation of the habit of holidays  <br>The consumption of tourism has been adopted as a form of lifestyle in many developed nations, and <br>increasingly in developing nations. Ac cording to Blichfeldt (2007), a family’s annual holiday is al so referred <br>to as an institution because of institutionalisation of holidays. Hyde and Laesser (2009) noted that holidays <br>have structure, as they are a lived human experience that occur within a defined period. Sometimes the habit <br>of holidays is influenced  by the status. According to Henama and Sifolo (2017a), the consumption of tourism <br>product offerings goes hand in hand with the prevalent consumer culture; where the consumption attains status <br>for the user. Tourism consumption must be made to be fashionabl e for society in a language and images that <br>will appeal within the prevalent consumer culture. The South African  stokvel  economy, which is a savings <br>vehicle for the majority of black South Africa ns, contributes towards the economy. For example, there <br>are stokvels  for holidays whereby a certain number of people save money together to travel to a certain <br>destination. Such travel includes buying travel packages from tour operators and promotes touris m 301 <br> consumption as a contributor to quality of life. The growth  of tourism requires the habit of tourism <br>consumption to become commercialised within a dominant consumer culture and thereby become fashionable.  <br>17.8.7 Place marketing  <br>According to Nel and Binns  (2002), place marketing is a strategic choice and involves a ctively publicising a <br>town’s assets, both imagined and real, to external investors and tourists, based on the belief that the resulting <br>investment will catalyse the economic revival. Destinations  that seek to increase their tourism arrivals must <br>market the mselves as tourist destinations, that is, as sites for tourism consumption. Place marketing can ignite <br>the robustness of domestic tourism and attract new market segments internationally resulting  in the attraction <br>of “new markets” into a country. Place mar keting must ensure that social media marketing outlays are well <br>packaged to get the required purchasing behaviour from the tourism consumers. Social media marketing is a <br>popular avenue that has e mbraced digital influencers.  <br>17.8.8 Reducing leakages  <br>In orde r for the local economy to benefit from tourism, it is advisable to make use of local services and <br>suppliers so that profits do not “leak” out of the local economy. Reduction of leakages is imper ative to ensure <br>that the tourism industry increases its devel opmental potential at a destination area. Increasing local ownership <br>is imperative so that the majority of the expenditure by tourists stays within the tourism destination. This <br>means that the to urism value chain should be looked at to develop local compet ence in delivering services. <br>This is done with the intention of retaining as much of the tourism injection as possible and reducing leakage. <br>Local ownership of the tourism industry is imperative for leakage reduction, on the other hand, the expertise <br>that foreign ownership brings is of benefit to the industry. An article by Sifolo (2015) introduces a theoretical <br>aspect on how to view the tourism sector from the supply chain management perspective.  Therefore, it is <br>essential to look at the tourism sector as the entire system of tourism supply chain that needs to be managed <br>to ensure customer satisfaction. Each participant in the value chain must be looked at to reduce leakage. <br>Tourism must improve t he standard of living, and quality of life, in order to recei ve the support of the host <br>community. Tourism is primarily developed for economic reasons, and it is therefore important that the <br>resident community benefits disproportionally. Tourism will not c ontribute towards poverty alleviation unless <br>the state takes a decision to ensure that tourism contributes towards poverty alleviation.  <br>17.8.9 Skills development  <br>In order to remain globally competitive, the tourism industry in South Africa must have skills  for the tourism <br>industry. The speed of change happening in t he world means that employers and entrepreneurs must <br>continuously train and retrain staff. One of the challenges for tourism entrepreneurs is lack of skills and <br>knowledge of the industry. Institu tions that offer tourism education must ensure that they offe r formal <br>programmes and also informal training programmes for the industry. This extends to foreignlanguage training <br>that will ensure that South Africa’s tourism industry remains globally competi tive. As a former British colony, <br>South Africans have good En glish comprehension, however, languages such as French, Spanish, Portuguese <br>and Mandarin require attention as we seek to ensure that tourism becomes the number one economic sector in <br>South Africa . <br>17.8.10 Embracing technology and the Fourth Industrial Revo lution  <br>Disruption is taking place across all industries and in all geographies. The fast pace of change brought by <br>technology has meant that many industries are facing disruption. Companies such as Uber and Airbnb are at <br>the forefront of this disruption, a s customers are emerging as providers of tourism product offerings, instead <br>of this being the exclusive preserve of businesses. Disruption has meant that customers have more power, and <br>tourism en trepreneurs and companies must embrace technology and adapt t heir tourism offerings. According <br>to Ernst and Young (2015), enormous opportunities exist for enterprises to take advantage of connected <br>devices enabled by the “internet of things” to capture vas t amounts of information, enter new markets, <br>transform existi ng products and introduce new business and delivery models. Technology has been felt in the 302 <br> area of work as companies increasingly deal with new competition, especially substitute competition. <br>Technology has emerged as a disruptor in the tourism industry. The emergence of low -cost carriers created <br>the incentive for Uber and Airbnb. Uber is able to offer cheap and reliable transportation at prices lower than <br>metered taxis, while Airbnb has created opportunities for lifestyle entrepreneurs to become hosts, co mpeting <br>with commercial tourist accommodation.  <br>The Fourth Industrial Revolution is upon us. The speed of change continues at a breath -taking rate. According <br>to Schwab (2016), a Fourth Industrial Revolutionary is building on the Third – the digital revoluti on that has <br>been occurring since the middle of the last century. It is characterised by a fusion of technologies, which blur <br>the lines between the physical, digital and biological spheres. This has resulted in the emergence of artificial <br>intelligence, the use of robots and the potential to increase pro fits as corporates replace people with robots. <br>This means that increasing mechanisation will lead to an increase in global unemployment as the world <br>population continues to increase. Moreover, entrepreneurship  opportunities presented by the Fourth Industri al <br>Revolution can be supported in emerging economies. For example, it is not only governments that must <br>embrace technology through progressive policies and the introduction of free WiFi as a basic human right.  <br>The Fourth Industrial Revolution will increase  the impact of the services economy on countries. As the <br>majority of African countries have a large percentage of young people, they will need labour -absorbing <br>economic sectors for an increasing population. Th e labour -intensive nature of tourism will be a benefit for <br>economies that understand that tourism growth is associated with an increase in labour opportunities. Since <br>tourism requires a multiplicity of skills for the various and cross -cutting industries th at are related to deliver <br>the tourism product o ffering, the integration of technology in tourism will result in fewer job losses than in <br>traditional industries such as agriculture and manufacturing. Countries that seek to mitigate the negative <br>effects rela ted to tourism marketing must embrace the chang es and adapt immediately to the Fourth Industrial <br>Revolution.  <br>17.8.11 Establish a Tourism Red Tape Initiative® (TRTI)  <br>Zhang, Song and Huang (2009) explain that tourism is a coordination -intense industry in whi ch different <br>products/services (transportation,  accommodation, and so on) are bundled together to form a final tourism <br>product. Henama (2016) identified that tourism destinations must develop a Tourism Red Tape Initiative ® <br>(TRTI), which identifies bottlen ecks that impede the growth of the tourism indu stry. For tourism to succeed <br>requires collaboration between different levels of the state, which can only be achieved when an institutional <br>framework is established and the TRTI can be a catalyst to develop th at institutional framework. The tourism <br>sector is private sector led, while the public sector must create an enabling environment. The TRTI is therefore <br>an institutional framework where the public and private sector can work together to grow tourism. The <br>bottoms -up approach to develop the TRTI would st art from municipalities to provincial and result in a national <br>TRTI strategy that would unleash  the growth trajectory of tourism, thereby creating jobs and driving economic <br>growth.  <br>17.9 CONCLUSION  <br>Africa conti nues to receive less than 10 per cent of intern ational tourism receipts – far below its potential. <br>Tourism is able to ignite economic growth, diversify an economy, and become an attracter of foreign <br>exchange. It is also disproportionally important for Afri can economies as they seek to diversity into th e service <br>sector, where tourism is located. In order to gain the support of the host community, it must be ensured that <br>tourism improves the quality of life and standard of living of the locals. This can only happen when tourism <br>planning ensures that pro -poor principles and linkages are made between the tourism sector and the broader <br>businesses in local areas. This is imperative to ensure that leakage is reduced as much as possible. <br>Interestingly, tourism deman ds that a country treats its citizens better; t he expansion of infrastructure and <br>super structures such as airports, roads and ports brings a country to international standards, which locals can <br>enjoy. The sharing of infrastructure is one of the benefits o f tourism. Tourism in Africa remains constraine d 303 <br> by the triple challenges of low levels of aviation access, low levels of personal safety and security and lack of <br>visa openness. What is without doubt is that tourism will continue in Africa and will create the incentives for <br>African countries to become safer, as tourism demands peace and security as a pre -requisite for growth. <br>Marschall (2005) comments that in South Africa, tourism is currently promoted as a panacea of all its ills <br>associated with developmen t, employment and income generation. In as much  as tourism is adopted as a <br>panacea for all ills, it’s worth noting that the success of tourism depends on a responsive state that prioritises <br>tourism as the developmental sector that must get 100 per cent gov ernment support.  <br>REVIEW QUESTIONS  <br>17.1 What are  other environmental, social and economic benefits that can be associated with the tourism sector?  <br>17.2 Explain why tourism is identified as cross -cutting in nature.  <br>17.3 How can tourism assist the economic cr isis? <br> <br>REFERENCES  <br>Acha -Anyi, P.N. 2015.

Taljaard  <br>LEARNING OUTCOMES  <br>After you have studied this chapter you will be able to  <br>▪ explain the different concepts in franchising  <br>▪ understand the essential requirements for establishing franchise  business operations and the ability to evaluate its <br>principles  <br>▪ demonstrate an understanding of the social and economic factors related to establi shing a franchise  <br>▪ analyse the environmental conditions for the establishment of a franchise  <br>▪ demonstrate an und erstanding of the financial and legal requirements to consider establishing a franchise.  <br>KEY TERMS  <br>▪ Franchise  <br>▪ Franchisor  <br>▪ Franchisee  <br>▪ Business -format  franchising  <br>▪ Franchise contract  <br>▪ Franchise fee  <br>OVERVIEW  <br>Franchising is a legal or marketing concept that starte d to develop in the late 1940s and 1950s, principally in <br>the US but also in other countries. The concept is often misunderstood, despite its wides pread use. Franchising <br>is seen as a method of marketing goods and services, which knows almost no boundaries i n terms of business <br>categories. It is therefore not one industry. Over many years, franchising has proven all over the developed <br>world and in many  developing countries that it is a viable method of distributing goods and services. This, in <br>turn, can have a  positive influence on economic development by its contribution to the establishment of new <br>businesses and job creation. Franchising can now be fo und in over 140 countries worldwide, and its efficacy <br>has been proven by its robustness even through periods o f economic downturn (Mendelsohn, 2005).  <br>18.1 INTRODUCTION  <br>It is inevitable that a business that brings in profits and that has captured the interest of a market will naturally <br>seek to expand. Franchising has become one of the fastest growing and popular st rategies for business <br>expansion. In essence, a successful business’s processes are being replicated continuously and run by <br>entrepreneurs who are called franchisees and who run their businesses under the supervision of the franchisor.  <br>The word “franchise” comes from the French word for “privilege” or “freedom”. F ranchising offers people <br>the freedom to own, manage and direct their own business. It therefore means being in business for yourself <br>but not by yourself (FASA, 1991). In essence, it gives an individ ual the right to operate a business or licence <br>under speci fic conditions.  <br>Franchising evolved out of a number of business transactions, methods and practices that have been common <br>and popularly known for many years (Mendelsohn, 2005). Some of the basic fea tures of these business <br>transactions, practices and method s are found in the following four elements:  <br>1. The ownership by one person of a trademark, a patent, an idea, a secret process, a specialised piece of <br>equipment and the goodwill and know -how associated  with it  308 <br> 2. The grant of a licence by that person to another permitting the exploitation of the trademark, idea, <br>process, service mark, patent or equipment and the goodwill and know -how associated with it  <br>3. The inclusion in the agreement that grants the licence , all regulations and controls relating to the <br>operation o f the business in the conduct of which the licensee exploits his or her rights  <br>4. The payment by the licensee of a royalty or some other consideration in the form of a continuing fee for <br>the rights, wh ich are obtained, and for any services, which the licensor  will provide to the licensee  <br>Franchising has great potential, nowhere more so than in South Africa, where entrepreneurship development <br>and job creation are national imperatives. The realisation of franchising’s potential depends on correct <br>implementation.  Much has been done, but much more can be achieved (Parker & Illetschco, 2007).  <br>The franchise world is constantly evolving, and so are the rankings according to the Entrepreneur’s 38th <br>annual Franch ise 500 rankings (Table 18.1 ). The Franchise 500 is however, sole ly a research tool one can use <br>to compare franchise operations. The ranked franchises are measured and analysed according to system size, <br>growth, and financial strength and stability. Factors such as social media presen ce are also included in today’s <br>econo my, which surely was not relevant 38 years ago.  <br>Investing in an established and credible franchise ultimately carries less risk since it is an investment in an <br>established brand. Therefore if you want to become part of one of South Africa’s top ten franchi ses, look <br>at Table 18.1  and consider where to invest.  <br>Table 18.1 South Africa’s top 10 franchises  <br>Name/Rank  Country of origin  Year started  Franchises in SA  <br>KFC USA <br>South Africa  1952  <br>1968  840 <br>(2017)  <br>SPAR  Netherlands  <br>South Africa  1932  <br>1963  800 <br>Steers  South Africa  1960  522 <br>Wimpy  United Kingdom  <br>South Africa  1962  <br>1967  500 <br>Debonairs  South Africa  1991  300 <br>MacDonalds  USA <br>South Africa  1954  <br>1995  148 <br>Kumon  Japan  <br>South Africa  1954  <br>1991  200 <br>Mugg & Bean  South Africa  1996  96 <br>Nando’s  South Africa  1987  54 <br>Keg South Africa  1992  30 <br>Source:  http://www.franchisefinder.co.za/Article%20Archive/SAs -top-ten-franchises.shtml  <br> <br>Looking at the franchise growth rate in South Africa within the last two years, the numbers are slowing do wn. <br>The total number of stores in May 2016 was 4 841 and decreased to a figure of 4 780 in May 2017 (Table 309 <br> 18.2). However, franchising is likely to continue growing as the sector remains a core part of the country’s <br>business sector.  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 310 <br> Table 18.2 Fast food franchises in South Africa  <br> <br>Source:  https://businesstech.co.za/news/lifestyle/173585/the -biggest -fast-food-franchises -in-south -africa -in-2017/  <br> <br>311 <br> It is evident from the statistics that KFC is  still the number one franchise in South Africa and the most <br>favourable fast food brand, making chicken franchises the most popular, with burger joints almost on par <br>followed by pizza.

The franchisor and franchisee both have responsibilities, <br>commitments and obligation s toward each ot her and these are usually specified in a franchise agreement or <br>contract. The franchisor owns the right to the name or trademark of the business, whereas the franchisee <br>purchases the right to use the trademark and system of business. In ter ms of arrangemen ts, the franchisor is <br>also answerable to his franchisees for ongoing matters such as training, management and marketing support <br>and assistance. Different types of franchising can evolve, such as manufacturer, wholesaler or retailer in <br>vario us industries (F ASA, 1999).  <br>18.2.1 Categories/forms of franchising  <br>18.2.1.1 Business -format franchising  <br>The business -format franchise describes a relationship between the franchisor and franchisee where the latter <br>is licensed to operate a proven business c oncept using the  franchisor’s name in accordance with its <br>standardised, fine -tuned package, which includes the products to be sold as well as the logos, trademarks, <br>décor, promotional material and menus of products (Business Directory, 2014). Business -form at franchising <br>involves not merely the exploitation of goods identified by a trademark or services identified by a service <br>mark, but the preparation of a “blueprint” for a successful way of carrying on a business in all its aspects. The <br>blueprint must be c arefully prepare d to minimise the risks inherent in opening any new business (Mendelsohn, <br>2005). For example:  312 <br> Table 18.4 Entrepreneur’s Top 10 Franchises for 2017  <br>Name/Rank  Initial Investment  Rand value  <br>1. 7–Eleven Inc.  $37K – $1.6M  R493K – R21.4M  <br>2.

In the case of  a mobile franchise, criteria will be estab lished by reference to the availability <br>of potential customers within a given  marketing area.  <br>• The training provided should include, as may be appropriate, any special methods of manufacture, or <br>processes to be applied to goods, or (as with fast -food operat ions) secret recipes, methods of preparation <br>and the manner of providing serv ices.  <br>• Training should be provided in the methods of marketing and merchandising, which are calculated to exploit <br>the merits of the business to the full.  <br>• Following training, assist ance should be given in getting the business ready to open for trading.  <br>• The r ight to use the description (i.e. the brand image, which may include a trademark or service mark) by <br>which the business is to be distinguished from other similar competing busines ses should be granted, <br>while at the same time the business is recognised by t he consumer as part of the larger organisation, <br>which comprises him and his fellow franchisees.  <br>• In order for the person granting the licence to be sure that the standards associat ed with the branding and <br>the system can be maintained, established restrictio ns and controls should be introduced into the <br>relationship.  <br>18.2.1.2 Product or distribution franchising  <br>A product franchise acquires the rights to a product where the franchisor supplies the product, may provide <br>initial and ongoing product training and, i n some cases, product advertising. With distributorship franchising <br>the arrangement is similar to a produ ct franchise, except for the fact that distributors are often permitted to <br>handle a wide range of complementary products. In other words, a product man ufactured by a franchisor (or <br>on his behalf by another) is sold to a franchisee who, in turn, sells it to  the consumer under the trademark of <br>the franchisor. The franchise is usually restricted to a particular geographical area and the franchisee pays fees  <br>referred to as royalties to the franchisor for the right to do business under his trademark (FASA, 1997) . 313 <br> 18.2.1.3 Manufacturing, production or processing franchise  <br>Franchising is essentially a marketing exercise that promotes a corporate or unitary image , which creates a <br>perception among consumers that all the franchise outlets offer the same quality and st andards of goods or <br>services (Nieman, 1998).  <br>Table 18.5 Comparison: distributors versus business -format franchise  <br>Aspect  Distributorship  BFF <br>Contract  General, negotiated  Detailed, imposed  <br>Legal status  Independent  Independent operator  <br>Rights  To a product  To a business system  <br>Existing skills  Usually a prerequisite  Usually unimportant  <br>Product  Usually no processing  Processing usually required  <br>Product r ange  Wide and from various sources  Clearly defined, limited  <br>Source:  FASA (1997)  <br>18.3 TYPES O F FRANCHISES  <br>18.3.1 What can be franchised?  <br>According to Mendelsohn (2005), franchises can vary to a wide extent from each other depending on the <br>business in which  they are engaged, or the industry in which they are found. An internationally recognised <br>distinction is made between the following types  of franchises:  <br>1. Manufacturers and wholesalers:  this is where the franchisor is the creator/producer and the franchisor <br>grants the franchise to a distributor or wholesaler, who is the franchisee. We often see this system in <br>the soft -drink industry such as C oca-Cola and Pepsi -Cola, where the manufacturer supplies a wholesaler <br>with the concentrate or syrup and the wholesaler mixes bottles and distributes the drink under licence.  <br>2. Manufacturers and retailers:  this is where the creator/producer is the franchisor and the retailer is the <br>franchisee. Typical examples of this system are automobile dealerships such as Nissan or petrol  stations <br>where arrangements have been made between convenience store operators (whether franchised or <br>not) and petrol -station owners for  the establishment of convenience stores on the petrol station <br>forefront.  <br>3. Wholesalers and retailers:  this is where the wholesaler is the franchisor, who establishes a franchised <br>network of retail outlets. Everyone trades under a common trademark and is lin ked by national <br>advertising and promotions. The types of businesses that fall within this category include hardware <br>stores, chemists, supermarkets and automobile aftercare businesses.  <br>4. Retailers and retailers:  this is where franchising has been chosen by th e franchisor who establishes <br>outlets at the retail level as the marketing method most suited to the expansion of the bu siness. This <br>type is not well known, but with international examples, the vast majority of “high -street” franchises <br>have developed in thi s way.  <br> 314 <br>  <br>CASE STUDY:  Nando’s  <br>The meteoric rise of Nando’s started from one outlet in Rosettenville to an international network consisting of over 550 <br>stores located on several continents within fewer than two decades. When the Nando’s brand was launched, several experts <br>doubted the co ncept’s chances of success in what they perceived to be a saturated market. The management  of Nando’s <br>proved them wrong by turning an everyday product into a lifestyle brand, offering customers an extraordinary experience <br>as well as value -for-money prices.  Having acquired an existing outlet that was intended to form the nucleus of a new chicken  <br>concept, Nando’s Chickenland (Pty) Ltd was formed by Robbie Brozin in 1987. He then brought Eric Parker on board to <br>help with the rollout of the concept.  <br>The origina l Nando’s store was initially located in Rosettenville, Johannesburg. It had been in exist ence for many years and <br>was difficult to change. So they decided to set up a new store from scratch in Savoy, building it to their specifications. Af ter <br>its doors ope ned in 1987, it was an immediate success. It generated profits from day one and the paybac k period was an <br>incredible six months. The pilot store’s success prompted them to reassess their expansion strategy.  <br>The Nando’s franchise model  <br>The original franchis e model resulted in a “joint venture agreement” and was structured in such a way that each  store would <br>be a company in which Nando’s would hold a minimum of 51% and the joint venture partner a maximum of 49% of the <br>shares. However, doubting the model’s mer its and evaluating its weaknesses after some time, Nando’s revised its joint -<br>venture (JV) model. Nando’s realised that it made a mistake in allowing some joint -venture partners to establish additional <br>stores as subsidiaries of their original stores. The ne w structure illustrated in  Figure 18.1  had the unintended result of <br>reducing Nando’s shareholding in second -tier stores to an effective 26%. Not only did this affect financial returns, but it also <br>caused an imbalance of power that was difficult to manage. The use of this expansion model had the (unintended) effect of <br>giving  joint-venture partner A (as indicated below) effective control of multiple stores (Parker  & Illetschko, 2007).  <br>Questions  <br>1. Knowing what Nando’s has to offer, what in your opinion were some of the critical success <br>factors from the early stages of Nando’s? (S ome further research needs to be done to get the <br>complete answer for this question.)  <br>2. What is the reason for establishing a pilot operation?  <br>Figure 18.1 The revised Nando’s joint -venture (JV) model  <br> <br>Source : Adapted from Parker & Illetschko (2007 ) <br> <br> <br>315 <br> 18.4 DEFINITIONS  <br>Many different definitions of franchising have been offered over the years. Thi s is due to the fact that <br>franchising covers a very broad range of businesses. Some definitions are general and try to include all possible <br>types of franchise. Others are more specific and give a much more specific definition of a particular type of <br>franch ise. <br>18.4.1 Business -format franchising  <br>“An arrangement whereby one person or firm (the franchisor) grants an independent party (the franchi see) the <br>right to sell the firm’s products or services according to the guidelines set down by the franchisor” (FASA , <br>1999).  <br>“A franchise arrangement whereby the franchisee obtains an entire marketing and management system geared <br>to entrepreneurs” (Longene cker, Petty, Palich, Moore & Baylor, 2014).  <br>18.4.2 Franchise  <br>“A franchise is a package of industrial or intellectual  property rights relating to trademarks, trade names, shop <br>signs, designs, utility models, designs, copyrights, know -how or patents, to be e xploited for the resale of goods <br>or the provision of services to end users” (Mendelsohn, 2005).  <br>“A business model in volving a business owner who licenses trademarks and methods to an independent <br>entrepreneur” (Longenecker et al., 2014).  <br>18.4.3 Franchise op eration  <br>A franchise operation is a contractual relationship between the franchisor and franchisee in which the <br>franc hisor offers to maintain a continuing interest in the business of the franchisee in such areas as know -how <br>and training. The franchisee oper ates under a common trade name, format and/or procedure owned or <br>controlled by the franchisor and in which the franc hisee has, or will make, a substantial capital investment in <br>his business from his own resources (Mendelsohn, 2005).  <br>Franchising can therefo re be seen as a grant by the franchisor to the franchisee, which entitles the franchisee <br>to use a complete business package with all the elements necessary to establish the business. It also enables a <br>previously untrained person to run the franchise effici ently and profitably according to the necessary <br>guidelines supplied (Nieman, 1998).  <br>18.4.4 Franchisor  <br>“The party in a franchise contract that specifies the methods to be followed and the terms to be met by the <br>other party” (Longenecker et al., 2014).  <br>18.4.5 Franchisee  <br>“An entrepreneur whose power is limited by a contractual relationship with a franchising organisation” <br>(Longenecker et al., 2014).  <br>18.4.6 Franchise contract  <br>“The legal agreement between franchisor and franchisee” (Longenecker et al., 2014).  316 <br> 18.5 ADVANTAGES  AND DISADVANTAGES OF FRANCHISING  <br>There are various reasons why people enter into a franchise contract instead of starting their own  business. <br>Franchising can be attractive for a variety of reasons of which the probability of success is one of the greatest  <br>advantages.  <br>The benefits gained from a successful franchising chain can be tremendous, which benefits the franchisor and <br>the franchisee (Van Aardt & Bezuidenhout, 2014).  <br>18.5.1 Discussion of advantages  <br>• Ongoing training, advice, research and development:  ongoing and initial training is provided to a new <br>franchisee, which helps to prepare him or her in all a spects of the business. The franchisor is also in a <br>position to provide ongoing research and development. This includes obtaining information from the <br>franchisee on changing customer needs, therefore contributing to new product or product ranges and <br>servic es. <br>• Reduced capital outlay with increased profits:  franchising provides the entrepreneur with the opportunity <br>to participate in a large business operatio n and at the same time, allow the capital that he or she has <br>invested to be used optimally. Franchising  can also make it possible for people with limited capital to <br>become small formal -sector business people by lowering the cost of entry at that level. The  entrepreneur <br>can expect to reach breakeven far sooner under the proper guidance of the franchisor.  <br>• Brand awareness:  the franchisor provides the franchisee with access to an established network, a trademark <br>and proven name that attracts customers and provi des the franchisee with a niche market that has <br>already been penetrated. A wider geographical spread of  a franchise operation secures heightened <br>awareness of its product in contrast to those of independent competitors. The uniformity of the <br>franchised outl ets afford it a far greater impact on the target market, which benefits both the franchisor <br>and franchi see. <br>• Buying power:  a franchise provides the owner of a small business access to the buying power of a large <br>business on an ongoing basis. The buying powe r often results in better prices and discounts that can be <br>negotiated for most items, including stock, corporate stationery, corporate clothing, lighting, fixtures and <br>fittings, and even insurance packages.  <br>• Infrastructure:  the entrepreneur also benefits fr om the service infrastructure such as central marketing, <br>proven systems, IT expertise and procedures un dertaken and provided by the franchisor. The combined <br>infrastructure can be used, for instance, to achieve a more effective marketing strategy by maximis ing the <br>ad spend of the group and obtaining better prices for advertising.  <br>• Business synergy:  buying a f ranchise means becoming part of a network where all members work together <br>so that everyone benefits. All franchisees make contributions to the benefit of  the franchise because they <br>are ultimately working for themselves and are therefore motivated to make a  success of it.  <br>• Increased success rate:  franchisees have a much better chance of business success than non -franchisees, <br>due to management and training sy stems that are in place to enhance effectiveness and efficiency, which <br>in turn reduce the risk of failu re. <br>• Exit strategy:  a successful franchise could have an excellent resale value as an established business. It is seen <br>as a more viable purchase option to  prospective buyers than a stand -alone proposition in the marketplace <br>if the infrastructure is in place . <br>18.5.2 Discussion of disadvantages  <br>• The franchisee is not completely independent because franchisees are required to operate their businesses <br>according to the specified restrictions and procedures set forth by the franchisor in the franchise <br>agreement.  <br>• The specified restrictions usually incl ude the products or services that can be offered, the pricing of the <br>product, and geographic territory.  <br>• Franchisees must pay ongoing royalties and advertising fees in addition to the initial franchise fee.  317 <br> • Franchisees m ust carefully balance restrictions an d support provided by the franchisor with their own ability <br>to manage their business.  <br>• If other franchisees are performing poorly or the franchisor runs into an unforeseen problem, it can result in <br>a damaged, system -wide  image.  <br>• The franchisee may have littl e or no say about the terms of termination and the term (duration) of a <br>franchise agreement, which is usually limited.  <br>• The service provided by the franchisor to the franchisee can be expensive, or even non -existent.  <br>• The franchise contract may have been for mulated in such a way that it protects only the rights of the <br>franchisor.  <br>• Even if a support structure is in place to help the franchisee, he or she may still fail because of cash -flow <br>problems or inexperience.  <br>• The franc hise might not be all it was expected  to be. What initially attracted the potential franchisee might <br>turn out to be a fad or might be a vehicle for fraud.  <br>• The satisfaction experienced by many franchisees often leads to disappointment due to the fact that <br>franchisors do not fulfil their initia l responsibilities or duties and because of the less -than -expected <br>prestige associated with the job.  <br>• The trade name is not always of value. Customer satisfaction with the product or service soon becomes <br>more important t han the trade name.  318 <br> ADVANTAGES/DISAD VANTAGES OF FRANCHISING  <br>Franchising holds many advantages but, like most things in life, there are disadvantages as well. Prospective franchisees <br>must be aware of this so that they can weigh up the pros and cons, and arr ive at an informed decision.  <br>Advanta ges from the franchisee’s point of view  <br>• The use of an established brand:  under the franchise contract and its terms, conditions and contract period, <br>you as the franchisee are allowed to operate under the umbrella of an e stablished brand, using a recognised  <br>trademark and operating in accordance with tried and tested operational principles.  <br>• A proven system:  unlike a truly independent entrepreneur, a franchisee need not prove the viability of the <br>concept. This has been done by the franchisor, who will have tes ted the concept in his or her own stores. This <br>would extend to the product or service, the marketing thereof and the systems and procedures necessary for <br>the profitable operation of the business.  <br>• Start -up assistance:  the franchisor will take every new fran chisee under his wing and provide the franchisee <br>with initial training, assist with site selection, fitting out and stocking of the store; and help with staff selection <br>and training, and also with pre -opening and opening  publicity. There will be no need fo r the new entrepreneur <br>to reinvent the wheel, and this is obviously a big advantage.  <br>• Ongoing support:  the franchisor will provide the franchisee with ongoing assistance in all aspects of operations. <br>This will be linked t o quality control and appropriate fe edback to the franchisee aimed at helping the <br>franchisee to improve all -round performance of the business in accordance with group norms. What is often <br>overlooked by critics of franchising is the fact that a franchisor’s  support structure in growing the br and frees <br>up the franchisee to concentrate on building the business and servicing the customer base.  <br>• Peer support:  going into business for yourself can be a very lonely endeavour, with very little chance to compare <br>notes  with similar businesses. The franch ise network of franchisees is a “family” of like -minded <br>businesspeople all set on achieving success. Challenges and problems can be shared individually or in group <br>sessions, seminars and conferences that the franchisor o rganises.  <br>• Benchmarking:  the inherent success of a good franchisor lies in the ability to benchmark the entire franchise <br>operation, fine -tune the costs and build up the optimum operating blueprint for all -round success.  <br>• Joint advertising:  the benefits of jo int advertising, which e manate from the advertising levy that most franchisors <br>charge, maximises brand awareness. The franchisor, with a cumulative marketing budget, can more <br>effectively operate an effective marketing programme from which all franchisees b enefit. Moreover, local <br>advertising undertaken by franchisees will often be developed centrally, resulting in increased effectiveness <br>and substantial cost savings.  <br>• Purchasing power:  the combined purchasing power of the network helps franchisees secure pref erential deals <br>from key suppliers. The franchisor either supplies goods to members of the network or negotiates favourable <br>terms on their behalf.  <br>• Easier to obtain finance:  it is a known fact that the odds for business success are far more favourable for <br>franchised operations than  for their independent counterparts, and banks are generally more favourably <br>disposed to lending to prospective franchisees – especially if the franchise they are buying into is an <br>accredited FASA member or has been audited by the b ank. <br>Disadvantages from the franchisee’s viewpoint  <br>• Taking a business risk:  although franchising offers a much lower failure risk than independent businesses, <br>there is always a risk when going into business. Assessing the right franchise opportunity carries  risk as the <br>franchisee may find it difficult to assess the quality of the franchises on offer or may find out only after he has <br>signed up that the franchise is not what it appeared to be. Painstaking investigation of the opportunity is <br>crucial to a sound decision.  <br>• Increased set -up costs:  the costs of a turn -key franchise with its upfront fee and the set standards in <br>furnishings, fittings and equipment are often much higher than going into business independently. This may <br>increase the initial cost of settin g up shop but the fact t hat all the research and contacts are already in place <br>more than makes up for the added costs. This definitely helps the franchisee in establishing the business <br>more quickly and shortens the period until breakeven is reached. Many f ranchise concepts, espec ially in the <br>food sector, will also include store upgrade clauses into the contract, which means the franchisee, after a <br>certain length of time, will have to refurbish the outlet at his own expense.  <br>• Rigid operating procedures:  the s uccess of the franchised  network depends on replication of the proven <br>formula and adherence to the proven business system. For individuals who thrive on experimentation and <br>innovation, this may be a bitter pill to swallow, and franchisees must always remem ber that although they o wn <br>the infrastructure of their businesses, they are contractually bound to adhere to the franchisor’s operational <br>guidelines.  <br>• Ongoing fees payable:  in addition to the upfront and set -up fees, a business format franchise system requi res a <br>contribution in th e form of a management service fee (formerly known as a royalty) which is important in <br>sustaining the ongoing support from head office to maintain a well -run franchise operation. Some franchisees <br>may regard the management service fe e coupled with the adver tising costs, which are pegged at either a <br>percentage of turnover or a fixed fee, as onerous.  319 <br> • Bad decisions by the franchisor:  if the franchisor makes mistakes, for example in his reading of market trends, <br>then this could have serio us consequences for fran chisees in the network. This is but one reason why it is <br>imperative to investigate the track record of a franchise before joining it.  <br>• Rebel franchisees:  if a franchisor does not impose strict operating procedures and standards that all his <br>franchisees must  adhere to, there is a risk that renegade franchisees will let the side down and cause <br>irreparable damage to the franchise and the brand.  <br>• Restrictions on the sale of the business:  an independent operator is free to sell his business  whenever he <br>wants to an d to whomever he chooses. He would not need to concern himself with the suitability of  the <br>purchaser to operate the business. Within the franchise scenario, the franchisor plays a big role in deciding on <br>the suitability of the prosp ective purchaser of an e xisting franchise.  <br>• Business failure:  there is always a chance, in any business venture, that the business will ultimately fail. The <br>reason could be recessionary developments, or simply because the reputation or the appeal of the pro duct or <br>service drops of f or even because the franchisee is not cut out to be in business or loses the personal drive to <br>succeed.  <br>While franchisees are the ones who are urged to consider the pros and cons of buying into a franchise, it is also good to <br>look at the advantages and d isadvantages from a franchisor’s point of view. Although it may seem that it is mostly the <br>franchisor that stands to gain the most, this is not always the case, and the responsibility of running a maintaining a <br>successful franchise is a very difficult one.  <br>Advantages from the franchisor’s viewpoint  <br>• Less capital required:  although starting a new franchise concept is not for the faint -hearted and requires <br>substantial financial investment to get the brand up and running, franchisees buy ing into the system provide <br>the funding to effectively grow the brand. Business expansion v ia the franchise route absorbs less capital than <br>the establishment of branches.  <br>• Rapid expansion possible:  the setting up of a franchise network by an entrepreneur us ing the franchise method <br>enables him to realise his expansion plans based on investments ma de by franchisees. With franchisees <br>providing the start -up capital and assuming responsibility for day -to-day operations, an entrepreneur can grow <br>his business much faster via the franchise route than if he set up a network of branches.  <br>• Streamlining operat ing costs:  a franchisor is able to streamline operating costs and branch staff costs as each <br>franchisee takes care of their own operating costs. The franchisor can t hen focus on developing the brand, <br>getting the best possible deals from suppliers and makin g sure that he services the franchisees.  <br>• Retaining control:  even with a network of franchisees who finance and manage their own businesses, the <br>franchisor always ret ains complete control over the brand and its development. As a result, expansion can <br>procee d at a much faster pace than would otherwise be possible.  <br>• Enhanced buying power:  with critical mass in the form of increased franchise outlets, the buying power of t he <br>franchisor increases improving the competitiveness of the franchisees and increases mark et share.  <br>• Dedicated owner -operators:  seeing that franchisees invest their own money, they are usually far more <br>committed to the long -term success of the business tha n a salaried branch manager. This in turn tends to lead <br>to increased customer satisfaction and accelerated growth of the individual outlets. It also results in enhanced <br>feedback on market trends and competitor activity at local level, further enhancing the  entire network’s <br>chances for accelerated growth.  <br>• Benchmarking:  with a pool of franchisees showing consistent performance, the franchisor is able to benchmark <br>and streamline forward planning to benefit future growth.  <br>Disadvantages from the franchisor’s vie wpoint  <br>• High set -up costs:  to set up and operate an effective franchise requires capital, an d the initial input includes the <br>research and development of the system, the set up of a pilot operation and the viability testing of the <br>sustainability of the conce pt. Although this expense is recouped to a certain degree through   <br> <br> <br>18.6 OPPORTUNITIES  <br>South Africa’s prospective franchisees are fortunate in the sense that they have a vast range of franchise <br>opportunities, of which most are locally developed. These ar e in essence tailor -made to meet the expectations <br>of the local market.  There are also an ever -increasing number of foreign concepts being added, meaning the <br>range of opportunities on offer is vast. South Africa also has a highly developed franchise culture  and its <br>bankers view franchising in a very positive light, making it relatively easy for prospective franchisees to raise 320 <br> finance. This is contrary to many countries overseas, where bankers continue to assess franchises in much the <br>same way as they would any other new business start -up (FASA, 1997).  <br>Between 2013 and 2014, c ompanies that made the Entrepreneur’s 36th annual Franchise 500 ranking <br>(see Figure 18.2 ) added 16 229 new franchise units.  Figure 18.3  illustrates the sectors within the South African <br>industry.  <br>Figure 18.2 Franchising sectors at the forefront of growth – domestically and abroad  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>321 <br>  <br> <br>Figure 18.3 Sectors within the S outh African f ranchise industr y <br> <br>Source:  Fin 24 (2013)  <br>18.7 FRANCHISING IN AFRICA – SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS  <br>Six of the world’s fastest -growing economies are in Africa. These include oil -rich Nigeria; politically and <br>economically stable Botswana and Et hiopia; Mozam bique; Rwanda; Tanzania; and Uganda. All meet the <br>international market selection (IMS) criteria of five per cent year -on-year gross domestic product (GDP) <br>growth and three per cent growth in GDP per capita. These African economies are growing through the <br>absence of civil war and stable policymaking. Botswana, for example, has managed, through sound <br>management, to transform itself from one of the poorest countries in the world to a middle -income country <br>with a per capita GDP of R192 709 in 2010.  Between 2000  and 2010, Nigeria’s GDP doubled. It is clear that <br>African countries have an interesting mix of indigenous micro franchises,  particularly in the areas of <br>agricultural health, mobile phones, fast food and petrol, and numerous investments by the  more promine nt <br>international franchisors such as KFC, Subway and Papa Johns. South Africa is an excellent example of how <br>franchising can be used in Africa to create jobs fast and assist local people set up small and medium enterprises <br>(SMEs) efficiently, by helping lo cal people set up SMEs under a franchise system. Franchising in South Africa <br>contributes an astonishing 12 per cent to the country’s GDP, and there is good reason to believe that the same <br>322 <br> success can be achieved in due course in some other Afr ican countrie s. This is due to the many South African <br>franchises that are indigenous systems tailored to the needs of this large and diverse country (Hoffman & <br>Preble, 2004).  <br>Success story  <br>African Atlantic Franchise Farming sells an agricultural franchise to local farm ers in Ghana, which enables them to benefit <br>from cheaper supplies of seed and fertiliser. They also provide additional training. African  Atlantic is pioneering a successful <br>new model of agriculture and business where it expands its base of ope rations and p artnerships. The business strategy <br>involves:  <br>• An agricultural model that works within local cultures and around them  <br>• A process that simultaneously affects transportation, logistics and architecture for the better  <br>• A scalable model that can be re plicated anywhere  <br>• A non -profit training extension that shares knowledge instead of hoarding it.  <br>From planting the seed to making the sale, the African Atlantic model is one of knowledge, discipline and teamwork.  <br>The functional mechanism of the African Atla ntic operation is similar to what one might find elsewhere in large -scale <br>agriculture. The agricultural production model is simil ar to what it it might be in the US planting, irrigation, harvesting and <br>logistics, which remains unchanged from a production a griculture context. The difference, however, lies in the <br>implementation and social application of these technologies as they play  out in a rural context.  <br>Source:  African Atlantic (2017)  <br> <br>Despite the many success stories, Africa remains a challenging envir onment for brands. This is because it is <br>not always possible to own or lease a property and restrictions exist for direct investments. Withholding taxes <br>erodes the profitability of the ven ture and repatriation of royalties can be subject to restraints. The  standards <br>of protection for intellectual property are lower than in Australia, the United States and Europe. Bureaucracy <br>and corruption are another inhibiting factor. Despite these facts,  franchising has still become an increasingly <br>attractive route for f oreign business to take in Africa. Proof lies in the overall 200 foreign franchises that are <br>reported to be active in Africa. For example, countries such as Nigeria, Kenya and Zimbabwe hav e established <br>franchise associations. These assist in improving the understanding of franchising as a business method. A <br>Pan-African Franchise Federation was also founded in 2013. Its formation follows ongoing efforts by the <br>World Franchise Council to esta blish a formal organisation for the franchise sector in Africa (Hoff man & <br>Preble, 2004).  <br>18.7.1 Non -quantitative factors in valuing a business  <br>When evaluating an existing business, one should also consider a number of non -quantitative factors. This is <br>very important to keep in mind, as it is likely that the business you co nsidering buying might be subject to <br>change regarding the following (Longenecker et al., 2014):  <br>• Market:  the ability of the market to support the business being purchased and all competing business units <br>should be determined. This requires personally observ ing each competitor’s place of business, doing <br>market research and studying census data.  <br>• Competition:  the prospective buyer should look into the location, intensity and extent of competing  <br>businesses. The buyer should also investigate how the business is c ompeting against rivals. New <br>competitors in the local marketplace may dramatically change an existing small firm’s likelihood of <br>success. Past performance is therefore no guarantee of futu re performance.  <br>• Future community development:  future developments in  the community could have an indirect impact on a <br>business, such as a change in zoning ordinances already enacted but not yet in effect, a change from a <br>twoway traffic flow to a one -way tr affic flow, and the widening of a road or construction of an overpas s. <br>• Legal commitments:  legal commitments may include unsettled lawsuits, contingent liabilities, delinquent tax <br>payments, missed payrolls, overdue rent or instalment payments, and mortgages  of record on any of the <br>real property acquired.  323 <br> • Union contracts:  prospective buyers should determine what type of labour agreement is in force, if any. <br>They should also determine the firm’s relationship with its employees as well as their job satisfaction  and <br>the company’s likelihood of success.  <br>• Buildings:  the quality of the buildings housing the business should be checked as well as any restrictions on <br>access to the buildings.  <br>• Product prices:  the prospective owner should compare the prices of the seller’s  products with those listed in <br>wholesalers’ or manufacturers’ catalo gues and the prices of competing products in general. This is <br>essential in ensuring full and fair pricing of goods whose sales are reported on the seller’s financial <br>statements.  <br>18.8 HOW T O ESTABLISH A FRANCHISE BUSINESS OPERATION  <br>The establishment of a fr anchise system inevitably arises in one of two ways, which is when a business person <br>decides to expand an existing business by use of the franchise method of marketing. The second is where  a <br>business is established with the aim to franchise from day one (M endelsohn, 2005). Nieman (1998) identifies <br>eight criteria which must be considered before embarking on a franchise operation.  <br>Table 18.6 Twelve critical success factors to determine if you r business is franchisable  <br>Twelve critical  success factors to determ ine if your business is franchisable  <br>In order to guide prospective franchisors in assessing the viability of their businesses for franchising, Parker and <br>Illetschko (2007) set out critical success factors in assessing the viabili ty of their business for f ranchising.  <br>1. Does the business operate in a large and growing market?  <br>2. Is the growth in the market likely to be sustainable?  <br>3. Are attainable margins sufficient to cover proposed franchise fees?  <br>4. Can the product or service demand a pri ce premium?  <br>5. Does the franc hisor have access to sufficient capital?  <br>6. Does the potential exist to establish a memorable brand?  <br>7. Is there a substantial barrier to entry – not easily copied?  <br>8. Will development costs allow a satisfactory return on investment?  <br>9. Is it possible to grow a franch ise culture in the company?  <br>10. Does the concept have staying power?  <br>11. Is it relatively easy to transfer the required skills?  <br>12. Are suitable systems and procedures in place?  <br> <br>1. Standardisation in products/services:  a high degree of st andardisation in the product or  services must <br>exist in the way the products or services are sold, as well as in the overall image and appearance of the <br>franchised outlets.  <br>2. Reproducibility:  a business concept must be developed by the prospective franchisor,  which can be <br>reproduced easily  in any location.  <br>3. Distinctive and noticeable business:  in order to be distinguished from its competitors, the business <br>must be distinctive and noticeable. It must have something unique that cannot be easily replicated by <br>othe rs. <br>4. Straightforward operating m ethods:  franchisees must be able to learn the operating system of the <br>franchising operation quickly, which is more easily done if the operation methods are straightforward.  <br>5. Profitability:  the market for the service or product  must be large enough to suppor t a sizeable franchise <br>network and the business must have a history of profitability. It is therefore preferable if the breakeven <br>point be reached relatively quickly in such a franchise outlet.  324 <br> 6. Regular supplies:  there should be sufficient suppliers and sup plies available of a specific product if the <br>business depends on the supply of a particular product.  <br>7. Legal constraints:  it is important to know the requirements of the Business Practices Committee and the <br>Competition Board as  well as the legal constraints in respect to the type of business.  <br>8. Personal commitment:  a moral responsibility for the wellbeing of the franchisees must be accepted as <br>well as the willingness to make a substantial investment in systems development and supp ort <br>infrastructure.  <br>18.9 DEVELO PING THE FRANCHISE PACKAGE  <br>The franchise package involves bringing together the elements of the business and reflecting the accumulation <br>of the franchisor’s total operational experience in a transmittable form.  <br>18.9.1 Operation manuals  <br>The operations and p rocedures manual (OPM) contains the detailed blueprint to be followed by the franchisee. <br>It therefore forms the basis of any franchise and without it there cannot be a franchise package. The OPM is <br>supplied by the franchisor to the fran chisee as part of th e franchisee package, to provide the franchisee with <br>step-by-step instructions on how to set up and operate a franchised unit to the correct specification and <br>standards of the franchise. The manual is strictly the copyright of the franc hisor and in this re spect is very <br>valuable as it protects the franchisor’s system from being copied (Parker & Illetschko, 1998). Parker and <br>Illetschko (2007) recommended including the following in the OPM:  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 325 <br> Figure 18.4 Steps in developing a franchise  <br> <br>Source: Adapted from Nieman (1998: 21)  <br> <br>326 <br> • An introduction to the franchise:  this includes the general business and related industries in which the <br>franchise operates. It also explains the products or services and franchise concept, work ethic and <br>strategies, mi ssion statement, philosophy and overall long -term goals of the franchise.  <br>• Step -by-step guidelines:  this discusses the specific legal and statutory requirements, as well as specific <br>location requirements to which the franchise must adhere. This includes fix tures and fittings, lease <br>negotiations, security, hiring of staff, setting up of systems and control, corporate colours, logos, initial <br>launch and promotional requirements (Rodkin, 1996).  <br>• The production equipment:  this refers to the necessary equipment to run the business, and details the <br>specific functions of each piece.  <br>• All details regarding the stockholding, systems and control , as well as pricing methods: the product or <br>service that is to be sold should be described in detail with exact specifications a nd customer <br>requirements. This part should cover all possible details to aid the franchisee and his or her staff, as this is <br>often the most used section of the operations manual. It includes aspects such as pricing policies, <br>minimum stockholding, initial s tock levels, product range, stock ordering, receiving, assembly and <br>distribution, and administrative and reporting requirements (Rodkin, 1996).  <br>• The accounting and administration system to be used:  this is usually based on the franchisor’s accounting <br>system  or one that is totally compatible with that of the franchisor. The franchisee is obliged to invite a <br>certified annual audit at his or her expense and the franchisor is granted the right to audit the books of <br>the franchisee. It is also expected of the fran chisee to provide the franchisor with a copy of his or her tax <br>return as well as periodic financial reports (Vaughn, 1979).  <br>• The business operation where the franchisee is obliged to meet specific operational standards:  this <br>includes: dress code; working ho urs; cash procedures and security; the level at which the franchisee <br>should keep the premises maintained; the standard of cleanliness expected; set standards of service and <br>product quality that the franchisee should meet; general standards of operation; st andards  regarding <br>inventory levels; and the right of the franchisor to evaluate whether the franchisee meets the expected <br>operational standards (Vaughn, 1979).  <br>• The duties of the franchisor:  these include providing advice and support.  <br>• Industrial relations:  the information refers to the terms of hiring and dismissing staff and the exact <br>procedures to be followed in this regard. It also includes the relevant labour laws, which should be <br>adhered to and the necessary employment and termination letters sent and r eceived. Also, the fact that <br>the employees should undergo specific training programmes provided or prescribed by the franchisor, <br>and the conduct of staff when dealing with customers, is discussed in detail.  <br>18.9.2 Franchise agreement  <br>The franchise contract  is a very important document, which is when the franchisor’s promises have to be <br>presented to the franchisee in writing and to be subjected to careful scrutiny. The contract is a legal <br>commitment, which is binding on both parties, and the franchisee must take competent legal advice as to the <br>meaning and effect of the contract. Consultation with a lawyer must confirm what he was told. The extent of <br>the advice given is only limited to the meaning and effect of the contract. The final decision lies with the <br>franchisee whether or not to proceed with any particular franchise opportunity (FASA, 1997). FASA (2006) <br>describes the franchise agreement as a legal contract, which clearly lays out the arrangement between the <br>person buying the franchise (the franchisee) a nd the person selling it (the franchisor). The franchise agreement <br>is therefore drafted by the franchisor and his or her representatives, with the objective of protecting the <br>business and ensuring standardisation of the franchises. The following aspects sh ould be included in the <br>franchise agreement (FASA, 2006).  <br>Asherson (1995) included additional provisions that should be covered in the franchise agreement, which are  <br>• advertising and corporate communications  <br>• use of trademarks and other intellectual property  <br>• fees payable to the franchisor  <br>• cession and assignment in terms of the franchisee’s rights  <br>• record -keeping and records.  327 <br> The franchise agreement  <br>• Parties involved in the agreement as well <br>as their prospective objectives  <br>• The rights whether or not to sell or <br>transfer ownership of the franchise  <br>• The legal rights to sell or transfer <br>ownership of the franchise  <br>• General functioning and construction of <br>the franchise such as operating hours <br>and overall look at feel  <br>• A description of the training and support <br>being offere d <br>• Precise boundaries of the territory <br>awarded  <br>• All operating systems guiding and driving <br>the franchise  <br>• Detail of your heirs’ rights in the event of <br>your death  <br>• The period of the agreement with the <br>rights to renew or extend the contract  • Set-up requirements an d development of the business <br>premises such as obtaining finance, shop equipment, <br>renovating the premises and legal obligations  <br>• Obligations of the franchisor, such as buying supplies or <br>services  <br>• Terms and conditions in the case of termination or breach <br>of the contract  <br>• The precise price, commissions, and rental fees involved  <br>• Overall functioning of the franchise, such as management, <br>involvement of the franchisee and the rights to <br>subfranchise  <br>• The necessary accounting system to be used  <br>• Definitions of all termi nology  <br> <br>18.9.3 Disclosure document  <br>FASA has compiled disclosure document requirements, which aim for full and complete disclosure by a <br>franchisor to a prospective franchisee. One of the m ost important requirements of the code is that a prospective <br>franchi see should not be permitted to part with any money or to sign a franchise agreement if it is fewer than <br>seven days after the disclosure document has been received (Nieman, 1998). It is the refore not only the <br>responsibility of the franchisor to ensure that the prospective franchisee receives a copy of the disclosure <br>document, but it is in the interests of all prospective franchisees to insist on it (Van Aardt & Bezuidenhout, <br>2014). The discl osure document  should include the information contained in the table  below (FASA, 2006):  <br>The disclosure document  <br>• The experiences of the directors and <br>executives  <br>• A description of the franchise  <br>• Ongoing payments due to the franchisor  <br>• A number of the existing franchisees and <br>their success rates  <br>• Support and training guaranteed  to the <br>franchisee  <br>• Financial data on the franchisor  <br>• Confirmation from the directors on the <br>viability of the system  • Track reco rd of the company  <br>• Initial required investment  <br>• Renewal, termination, goodwill or assignment of <br>agreement  <br>• Assistance from the franchi sors in selecting approved <br>sites <br>• Financial information about the pilot operation  <br>• Certificate from the accountant or auditor o n the <br>business being a going concern  <br>• The total investment required, indicating all costs  <br>18.9.4 Marketing the franchise package  <br>The best way for a franchisor to market a franchise package is by demonstrating its success. This is because <br>it is the quality of the underlying business that is most important.  328 <br> 18.9.4.1 Franchisee recruitment  <br>Illetschko (2005) suggests a five -step approac h to recruiting franchisees.  <br>• Step 1: Generate enquiries  <br>– Develop a franchisee -information folder  <br>– Present the franchise at seminars and exhibitions  <br>– Compile a visual presentation  <br>– Offer to speak at small business events  <br>– Advertise in newspapers and ma gazines (and FASA).  <br>• Step 2: Set follow -up procedures in motion  <br>– Determine who will deal with initial enquiries in order to give an appropriate response  <br>– Keep a record of every franchise enquiry  <br>– Keep track of promising enquiries until negotiations have ei ther been successfully concluded or terminated  <br>– React in writing when further information is requested by enquirers (include a questionnaire for completion <br>by the enquirer)  <br>– When the questionn aire is completed and returned, look into the applicant’s back ground, financial standing <br>and any references provided.  <br>• Step 3: Invitation to a meeting  <br>– It is essential that one gives the applicant in -depth information about the business opportunity and dis cusses <br>the necessary investment. During the personal meeting, assess the applicant’s potential for your organisation.  <br>• Step 4: Enter into concrete negotiations  <br>– The comprehensive information folder can be handed over to the applicant if both parties feel p ositive about <br>the negotiations. When receiving the folder, the  entrepreneur should sign the initial undertaking (which should <br>be dated to record the receipt of the disclosure document). You can then agree on the location of the unit, and <br>prepare customised  financial projections and statements pertinent to the territo ry under negotiation, taking the <br>earnings requirements of the franchisee and other specifics into account. Encourage the prospective franchisee <br>to discuss the disclosure document, financial figu res, and franchise agreement with professional advisors, and <br>stress the confidentiality obligations.  <br>• Step 5: Formal agreement  <br>– The formal franchise agreement can be signed in the office of a professional advisor nominated by the <br>franchisee, once all the d etails have been finalised. Once the agreement has been signed , one should do the <br>following:  <br>a)  Bank the cheque for the upfront fee or confirm the EFT has been processed  <br>b)  Set up the “start -up assistance package” in motion  <br>c)  Schedule the franchisee’s training.  <br>18.9.5 Financial aspects of franchising  <br>When buying a franchise or expanding on a franchise basis, a business person should set clear monetary <br>objectives. Whether a prospective franchisor or franchisee, the following key questions should be asked  <br>(FASA, 1999):  <br>1. What remuneration can I expect to earn from the  business on a monthly basis?  <br>2. What return can I expect from investing my capital in a particular business venture, i.e. net profit as a <br>percentage, wage of the total capital invested?  329 <br> 18.9.5.1 M onthly remuneration  <br>Two fundamentals need to be in place:  <br>• The franchisor needs to have one or more pilot operations in place, which form the foundation of <br>profitability from which the infrastructure can expand.  <br>• The business to be franchised should have sufficient market potential to open more than one franchised <br>store and rapidly actualise its potential by an aggressive rate of expansion, so that critical mass can be <br>achieved quickly. The franchisor then makes money from the management services fee levied on the <br>franchisees’ combined turnover. Consequently, the mo re franchisees in place, the greater the cumulative <br>fees earned by the franchisor.  <br>18.9.5.2 Financial projections  <br>The franchisor will provide the prospective franchisee with a set of financial projections that show the <br>expected trading results of the unit over the forthcoming two to three years. These projections are frequently <br>based on assumptions that may or may not materialise. It is therefore much better to ask the franchisor to <br>prepare a set of financial statements based on the actual performance of a unit that is comparable, in as many <br>aspects as possible, to the unit under negotiation (FASA, 1997).  <br>18.9.5.3 Upfront fee  <br>The upfront fee pays for the rights that the franchise agreement awards to the franchisee, such as the use of <br>the established trading name  and trademark and access to the franchisor’s trade contacts and know -how.  <br>18.9.5.4 Raising of finance  <br>It is the prospective franchisee’s responsibility to provide the necessary capital for the establishment and <br>operation of the unit. The financial project ions provided by the franchisor should therefore give a clear <br>indication of total capital requirements and attendant cash flows. One should also be told when to expect to <br>invest additional capital. For example, if it is the franchisor’s experience that the  new unit will require <br>additional equipment or vehicles around the middle of the second year of trading , the projections should show <br>that. <br>18.9.5.5 Ongoing fees  <br>The management service fee, in most cases, is the franchisor’s main source of income, and there fore the main <br>reason for him to operate the franchise. A lot of emphasis is often put on the level of m anagement fees the <br>franchisee is expected to pay. One should rather ask, “What can I expect to get in return for the payment?” <br>The management services fe e should be high enough to motivate the franchisor to provide the range of ongoing <br>services that was pr omised.  <br>The management services fee is mostly calculated as a percentage of sales. Percentages, however, range from <br>four per cent to 10 per cent of which  the fee levels are customary throughout various industries. Caution must, <br>however, be taken if a prosp ective franchisee is asked to pay a fixed weekly or monthly management service <br>fee, or the management services fee is expressed as a percentage of sales,  but subject to a minimum fee. This <br>often occurs to those in the informal sector, where turnovers are t ypically low and administration systems <br>leave much to be desired (FASA, 1999).  330 <br> 18.10 CONCLUSION  <br>Franchises that have a sound concept offer unlimited grow th potential to entrepreneurs who have the staying <br>power to nurse the business from small beginnings i nto a national and even an international concern. Starting <br>a business, becoming a franchisor, or buying an existing  business are all potential paths that can lead to the <br>entrepreneurial dream. Whatever your particular circumstances, it is still important t o remember to do proper <br>research and planning whatever path you choose to take. All business owners must invest themselves, as well <br>as their money, if the y want their companies to succeed. It is up to you to devote your time, effort and resources <br>if you wa nt to achieve your goals.  <br>SUCCESS STORY  Unjani “clinics in a container”: social franchising in South Africa  <br>Unjani (a Zulu word which means “How are you?” ) clinics were the brain child of Dr Iain Barton who after 10 years in general <br>practice had realised t hat a great deal of what he was doing with his patients could be perfectly well handled by nursing sisters. <br>After joining the corporate world as CEO of RT T, a pharmaceutical supply chain company, Iain came up with a model to <br>implement this insight and make  a difference in South Africa’s underresourced public health system. With the help of Deon <br>Vos, RTT opened the first two clinics.  <br>Iain’s company was bough t by Imperial Holdings, a large South African group of companies, which employed 51 000 people <br>in 31 countries on five continents. Iain, as MD of IHS, decided he wanted Imperial to buy into the Unjani concept and took th e <br>top execut ives to see two of the c linics. He got their buy -in immediately and Imperial decided to create Unjani Clinics NPC and <br>focus on the Unjani Clinics Project as its enterprise development initiative. An initial investment of R7 000 000 was made in  <br>the Unjani C linic pilot from 2010 to  2014 to transform health care, empower women and create jobs. The dream was to open <br>400 clinics in all parts of South Africa to make a real impact. Unjani Clinics NPC was a not for profit company (which allowe d <br>donors to claim tax benefits) with an indepe ndent board of directors and an advisory committee who were all senior Imperial <br>executives.  <br>The clinics  <br>Unjani Clinics was a social franchising system founded on an owner -operated model aimed at “the bottom of the pyramid” <br>underserv ed health -care markets. The first clinic opened in 2010 and within four years there were six clinics functioning well <br>in townships close to the head office. The situation of the clinics had proved to be a critical success factor. After struggl ing <br>with this , Iain called in a non -governmental organisation (NGO), which consulted with them and identified the key drivers of <br>successful clinic placement. The clinics were typically built off -site in 12 -metre shipping containers and, while being “no -frills”, <br>were st ate of the art.  <br>The fina ncial model  <br>Each clinic cost Unjani R1.2 million over five years. Approximately R700 000 was for the initial clinic construction, deliver y and <br>stocking. Each clinic received a working -capital contribution of R12 000 a month for the first eight months, then  R8 000 per <br>month for the next eight months and finally R4 000 for the next eight months. The contribution was aimed at getting the clini c <br>on its feet, while the client base was built up and was paid irrespective of the clinic’s fin ancial performance. The remaining <br>R300 000 was a working capital balance for support from Unjani head office.  <br>The main financial driver of Unjani’s success was finding “the sweet spot between what the low -income patients were prepared <br>to spend per visit an d the costs of running t he clinic”.  <br>Iain said that Unjani’s success “hadn’t been plain sailing. It had been built on dogged commitment, an ‘anything can be done’  <br>attitude, continual reviews of every component and ongoing learning by all of its leaders”. He  estimated he had spent two per <br>cent of his working time over the last seven years on Unjani and said, “I’m just the painter. I show them the picture we are <br>aiming for – then hold them accountable.”  <br>Source:  Adapted from Sutherland & Krige (2017).  <br>REVIEW QU ESTIONS  <br>18.1 What are th e essential provisions a franchisor should include in the franchise agreement?  331 <br> 18.2 Identify the four types of franchising in terms of “what can be franchised”?  <br>18.3 Indicate what the differences are between distributors and busines s-format franchising.  <br>18.4 Business -format franchising involves the preparation of a “blueprint” in order to reduce risks inherent in opening any <br>new business.

The Family Firm Institute (FFI) estimated that 70 to 90 per cent of global <br>gross domestic product (GDP) annua lly is created by family businesses (Family Firm Institute, 2016; <br>Alderson, 2011).  Table 19.1  provides an overview of family businesses worldwide with respect to national <br>GDP and the workforce employed by family businesses , as indicated by  Tharamat  magazine (2014) cited by <br>the FFI (2016).  <br>Table 19.1 The economic impact of the famil y business worldwide  <br>Countries  Family business contribution to <br>GDP  The number of people employed in family <br>businesses  <br>Italy 94% More than half o f employed Italians  <br>Equador  93% 51% <br>Lebanon  85% Unknown  <br>Pakistan  80% Unknown  <br>Mexico  79% 90% <br>India  79% 66% 334 <br> Countries  Family business contribution to <br>GDP  The number of people employed in family <br>businesses  <br>Peru  74.7%  75% <br>Venezuela  73% 50% <br>Bahrain  73% 28% <br>Costa Rica  70% 60% <br>Uruguay  70% 50% <br>Singapore  70% 50% <br>Argentina  68–70% 30% <br>Malaysia  65% 67.2%  <br>Colombia  65% 60% <br>El Salvador  65% 60% <br>USA 63% 57% <br>Chile  60% 60% <br>Germany  57% 55% <br>Brazil  50% 86% <br>Finland  50% 40–45% <br>Portugal  50% 60% <br>South Africa  50% Unknown  <br>Netherlands  49% 53% <br>Belgium  45% 55% <br>Iraq 35% Unknown  <br>Southern Korea  Unknown  48.2%  <br>France  >60%  60% <br>Spain  65% 65% 335 <br> Countries  Family business contribution to <br>GDP  The number of people employed in family <br>businesses  <br>China  Unknown  65% <br>UK 40% 70% <br>Philippines  Unknown  76% <br>Dominican <br>Republic  Unknown  80% <br>Sources:  Family Firm Institute (2016); Alderson (2011)  <br>Family businesses have special characteristics that are not ordinarily found in t he non -family business. Family <br>businesses are found in every sector of the economy and v ary in size and structure. Some of the largest <br>companies in the world are family businesses. According to Bhalla (2015), family businesses are an important <br>part of the corporate landscape as they contribute positively to the world economy. Although they ha ve special <br>dynamics, such as issues regarding the founder, the family, the business environment and the future, family <br>businesses continue to thrive.  <br>Family businesses are important to both developed and emerging economies as they sustain growth, create <br>jobs and lift millions of people out of poverty. It has been observed that in the developing world, family <br>businesses quickly grow to be major economic forces (Bruton, Ah lstrom & Obloj, 2008). The primary <br>difference between the family business and other bus inesses is the combination of family and business, and <br>the need to balance the family’s interests and values with its business strategies.  <br>In this chapter we turn to the  business environment and identify and expand upon five key issues facing the <br>family bu siness within developing economies. We begin with the competitive advantage of a family business <br>in both the developed and the emerging economy. This section identifies the competitive advantages of <br>operating in developing economies; particularly in South Africa. Issues such as accessibility and technological <br>aspects are fundamental in these times of globalisation. We will also identify the marketing advantage and <br>unique ingredients of family businesses. The challenges facing a family business in emerging e conomies and <br>some success stories will be highlighted. Proper application of family -business principles and practices <br>(among others, succession planning and resolving co nflicts) remain a cornerstone for the success of the family <br>business.  <br>19.2 DEFINITION O F A FAMILY BUSINESS  <br>According to the Family Firm Institute (2016), a family business is considered a company that is controlled <br>and majority owned by members of the same  family. Alderson (2011) has adopted the following definition of <br>the family business from the Family Firm I nstitute:  <br>The family business is the business governed and/or managed with the intention to shape and pursue the vision <br>of the business held by the d ominant coalition controlled by members of the same family or a small number <br>of families in a manner that i s potentially sustainable across generations of the family or families.  <br>The most accepted definitions therefore hint at ownership, business -related r oles and management <br>responsibilities (Chua, Christian & Sharma, 1999; Arregle, Batjargal, Hitt, Webb, Mille r & Tsui, 2013).  336 <br> According to Alderson (2011), in many emerging high -growth markets, family businesses dominate and are <br>beneficial to the industriali sation and early -stage of development of the country’s economic infrastructure.  <br>19.3 FAMILY BUSINESS THEORI ES/MODELS  <br>A family firm relies on two important theories about the nature of family firms and how they differ from non -<br>family firms. According to Bar rette (2014), family firms are underpinned by systems theory, which, at the <br>broadest level, focuses on view ing the world in terms of the interrelationships of people with one another. In <br>this case, we are referring to family businesses which have family me mbers as owners, managers and/or <br>employees. This may potentially lead to conflicts owing to two systems (fa mily and business systems) <br>overlapping. Similarly, Nieman and Nieuwenhuizen (2014), indicate that there are two broad systems in a <br>family business: t he family and the business (see  Figure 19.1 ). The family system is a social syste m that <br>focuses on caring for its members and can therefore be regarded as more emotional. Questions such as  “What <br>is good for the family?” could lead to actions being more conservative, which in turn could result in changes <br>not being readily accepted. The protection of the family’s name and reputation could become more important <br>than the exploitation of new ide as. Entrepreneurship is therefore negatively influenced, which may cause the <br>business to stagnate.  <br>The main characteristic of business in general is that it is task oriented. In order to survive in a rapidly changing <br>environment, new ideas are continually being identified and turned into opportunities. Change is therefore a <br>way of living, and could be a source of potential conflict.  <br>Figure 19.1 The two  broad systems of the family business  <br> <br>Source:  Nieman & Niewenhuizen (2014)  <br> <br>It is sometimes assumed that there are fewer potential conflicts in family businesses, and that a stewardship <br>model, in which business owners see themselves as holding the firm i n trust for future generations, is more <br>appropriate (Barrette, 2014). Accordin g to Barrette (2014), the three overlapping circles model allows one to <br>focus on the positive and negative consequences of the overlap between family, ownership and management <br>in family firms. Nieman and Nieuwenhuizen (2014) explain that success in a famil y business can be ensured <br>only if the two broad systems (family and business) are balanced. If one system dominates the other, conflict <br>337 <br> can be expected, which could destroy the f amily business. These two systems can, however, be further divided <br>into subsys tems. The family system can comprise the family, family by marriage, parents, brothers and sisters, <br>and family inside and outside the business. Even the business system consists of various subsystems, such as <br>managers, owners, employees and external networ ks. In order to operate as a successful family business, each <br>member of the family and the business system should know exactly where he or she fits into the total system <br>and what  his or her rights and privileges are. The model in  Figure 19.2  can be expanded t o give a truer <br>reflection of the complexity of a family business. The differen t roles are as follows:  <br>1. Family members  <br>2. Non -family investors  <br>3. Non -family employees  <br>4. Family shareholders  <br>5. Non -family working owners  <br>6. Working family members  <br>7. Working family owners  <br>8. Family  owners and business leaders  <br> <br>Figure 19.2 The three -circle model  <br> <br>Source:  Murray (2001) cited in Nieman & Niewenhuizen (2014)  <br> <br>It is therefore clear that a family business is complex and clear and accepted role classification is a requirement <br>for this typ e of business.  <br>338 <br> 19.4 FAMILY BU SINESS DYNAMICS IN EMERGING MARKETS  <br>There are many issues that need to be borne in mind when it comes to family businesses in emerging <br>economies. These include environmental, socioeconomic, legal, political and technological is sues. For <br>example, in South A frica, the abolition of apartheid and the beginning of black economic empowerment <br>changed the foundation upon which the nation rested (Brunding & Kristoferson, 2013). The ease with which <br>a family business could start and run; a nd the growth potential of ru nning a business in the South African <br>landscape and beyond were opened up to many.  <br>Furthermore, Brunding and Kristoferson (2013) explain that achieving a balance between the family’s <br>traditions and the need for innovation in or der to grow and develop can c ause conflict for this type of business. <br>Within a family business, tradition often bonds family members and links one generation of business leaders <br>to the next (Scarborough, 2012). This idea was echoed by Khavul, Bruton and Wo od (2009) in their research <br>on East African entrepreneurs. They show that some of the constraints on informal family businesses in the <br>East African countries of Kenya and Uganda are that they not only use strong family and strong community <br>ties to establis h and grow businesses, but th ey also use strong community ties to counterbalance the obligations <br>that strong extended family ties create. The African tradition of strong extended family ties is one factor that <br>differentiates between family businesses in th e developing and the develope d world  <br>Family businesses that turn into conglomerates in emerging countries, particularly in Africa, have not been <br>fully explored. However, there are relatively smaller family -owned businesses that pass under the radar that <br>offer the greatest insight into  Africa’s changing business landscape. For example, some of the larger family <br>offices in Africa include the Kenyattas (family of former Kenyan president Jomo Kenyatta with interests in <br>the hotel, dairy, media and banking indust ries), Dos Santos (family of former Angolan president Eduardo dos <br>Santos  with interests in telecom, banking and oil and gas), and Motsepes (family of South African billionaire <br>Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe with vast interests in mining), just to name a few. Giv en the fact that there are fe w <br>conglomerates in Africa, this is reflected in the research conducted by Goel and Jones (2016), where they <br>systematically review and explore 59 publications examining exploration and/or exploitation in family firms <br>published b etween 2001 and 2015. From th ose published, only two publications were published in South <br>Africa. Hence, there is call to focus more on differentiating family businesses in developed countries from <br>emerging countries. It is worth noting that the characteri stics of big family businesse s in developed countries <br>may not be inclusive of everything from big family owned businesses in Africa, however, they are the true <br>reflection of different landscapes. According to Bhalla (2015), “family businesses performance e volves <br>exactly the same oppos ite on every dimension (both in developed and emerging economies)”.  Table <br>19.2 identifies the differences between developed and developing economies as per Bhalla’s presentation, <br>particularly with regard to their performance and the roles people play in family businesses.  <br>Table 19.2 Dynamic forces in de veloped and emerging economie s <br>Overview of family businesses in developed <br>countries  Overview of family businesses in emerging economies  <br>Performance  <br>• Thirty per cent of businesses are family <br>businesses, e.g. Walmart, Google, Coke <br>(Bhalla, 2015)  <br>• Focus on res ilience and stability  <br>• Do not only rely on family ties for succession, <br>but bring in professional managers, and <br>view this step as inevitable  <br>• Believe in  using cash rather than getting into <br>debt Performance  <br>• Grow faster than non -family businesses in good and  <br>bad times  <br>• Less profitable but willing to invest towards growth  <br>• Take on more debt  <br>• More willing to be involved in larger mergers and <br>acquisitions than  non-family businesses  <br>Role of the family in the business  339 <br> Overview of family businesses in developed <br>countries  Overview of family businesses in emerging economies  <br>• Tend to be more profitable  <br>• Take on less debt  <br>• Cautious with acquis itions  <br>Role of the family in the business  <br>• Understand that not every child in the business <br>can have the qualities for succession  <br>• Role of family member s seems to decrease <br>through the generations.  • Between 50 –80 per cent of large companies are <br>family businesses (Ted Institute, 2016)  <br>• Start small but grow quickly  <br>• Rely on family members for succession and are often <br>concerned that a non -family member may not be a <br>good fit for the family culture  <br>• Role of family members seems to increase from <br>generation t o generation  <br>• Rely more on trust between family members, <br>customers,  employees and community  <br> <br>Given the above -mentioned dynamics, the potential exists to embrace the competitive advantage that family <br>businesses have in emerging economies. Bhalla calls on en trepreneurs to use “the systems available in the <br>emerging countries , not to copy the systems, the processes, the values and the IT from the West” (Bhalla, <br>2015).  <br>19.4.1 Competitive advantage of a fam ily business in an emerging economy  <br>According to the Fami ly Firm Institute (2015), the general contribution of family enterp rises to the economy <br>includes:  <br>• Family businesses show higher profitability in the long run.  <br>• Family businesses are less likely to lay  people off and more likely to hire despite the possibili ty of an <br>economic downturn.  <br>• Family businesses are more likely to gi ve charitably to their respective communities and engage in extensive <br>philanthropic activities.  <br>• Family businesses have a longer -term  strategic outlook due to their main motivation being to create a legacy <br>for generations to come.  <br>• Family businesses are less  likely to raise debt and are widely deemed financially prudent.  <br> <br>It should be noted that not all of the above points are evident in family businesses in emerging economies, <br>particularly in  the African context (see the  table  of comparison above). Although globalisat ion has affected <br>the practices and the ways of doing business in general, while also encouraging development, some caution <br>family businesses in developing economies against blindly adopting practices from the West. Family <br>businesses in emerging economies a re encouraged to take the lessons available to them to improve efficiency <br>and effectiveness. Bhalla (2015) emphasises this point by stating that copying systems from the West is not a <br>good idea, since  family busines ses in emerging economies need to define ways suited to them, while still <br>considering their business environment. However, there are great examples within the African continent. After <br>the transformation of Rwanda in 1994, the country is emer ging as a regio nal high -tech hub and boasts one of <br>sub-Saharan Africa’s fastest -growing GDP rates (World Economic Forum, 2016).  <br>Many African countries are now seen as “frontier emerging economies” with relatively well -developed <br>financial markets, hence platforms such as : Group of 77 and China; the Indian Ocean Rim Association for <br>Regional Cooperation; the New Asian -African Strategic Partnership; the India -Brazil -South Africa <br>Partnership Forum (IBSA); Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) Intergovernmental  Forums, <br>which provide more opportunities for growth. These platforms permit investment opportunities. A good <br>example is that of the family business from Kenya (refer to the  box below on the Ramco Group).  340 <br> Although trading conditions in emerging economies can be challenging due to limited formal support systems, <br>family businesses can employ a number of strategies to counteract  this: <br>• Personal selling approach:  Word of mouth is the cheapest and one of the most  powerful tools in terms of <br>marketing.  <br>• Accessibility:  Family businesses in emerging economies have the opportunity to access strong international <br>markets and international s upport systems (e.g. robust technology platforms) to aid their growth.  <br>• Technologica l systems:  by cleverly using widely available technology to provide better, faster and efficient <br>service to customers, family businesses in emerging economies can remain com petitive. For example, <br>using the cloud for a family business can be beneficial with  regard to security issues, virtual management <br>and business continuity.  <br>• Cultural forces:  An understanding of the cultural and institutional forces within an emerging economy  gives <br>the family business a competitive advantage over competition originating fro m mature economies (where <br>institutional structures may vary reatly) (Bruton, Ahlstrom & Obloj, 2008).  <br>19.4.2 Prospects for family businesses in emerging economies  <br>Ramco Grou p, founded in early 1940s by Rambhai Patel, Kenya  <br>Kenya’s Ramco Group was founded b y Rambhai Patel, an Indian immigrant who settled in Nairobi in the early 1940s and <br>founded a hardware store in the city’s downtown district. His three sons, Kirit, Mahendra and Chandrakant joined the family <br>business after completing their studies and helpe d expand Ramco into print, stainless steel, IT and office supplies. Ramco <br>now has operations in Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda, employing more than 2 000 people with an annual turnover exceeding <br>$220 million. Kirit is chairman, and his brothers serve on the c ompany’s board.  <br>The influence of the family business is prevalent and it continues to grow. According to research  by McKinsey <br>& Company (2014), by 2025 more than 15 000 comp anies worldwide will have at least $1 billion in annual <br>revenues; 37 per cent of th ese will be emerging -market family firms. Yang (2015) predicated that Asia will <br>be the hotbed for growth because of its cherished tradition of family businesses and the pros pect of rapid <br>economic growth over the next decade or two. Asian students have a co nservative view with regard to risk <br>and were more willing to become entrepreneurs because of the family businesses to which they are exposed <br>(Henama, 2013).  <br>19.4.3 Challenge s facing family businesses in emerging economies  <br>There are many hindrances to fami ly businesses worldwide. The complexity of dealing with the heterogeneous <br>interests, goals, assets and preferences in many business families has not been dealt with by the re search <br>community (Chandler, 2015). However, Chandler (2015) was able to expand on the work of Zellweger and <br>Kammerlander (2015) of trying to measure the heterogeneity and complexity of family members and family <br>relationships. The following challenges are i dentified by Chandler (2015):  <br>• Role conflict:  family members may be involved or occ upy different roles in the business, either as members <br>of the family, as owners of the family assets, and as managers and employees. Hence, simultaneous roles <br>can be an inter mingling of family considerations and business decisions. These may lead to role c onflicts <br>with regard to family issues, while family decisions may be unduly influenced by business needs. Thus, the <br>management of family assets may lack marketplace objectivi ty and profit discipline, while individual <br>family members may feel the effect of a  conflict.  <br>• Affective conflict:  this is one of the forms of conflict that naturally occur in almost all groups and <br>organisations. In a family businesses, particularly within a n emerging business, personal disagreements or <br>dislikes between individuals in a t eam or different families may occur.  <br>• Investment preferences:  investment needs and preferences differ based on different objectives and <br>expectations regarding risk appetite, a sset classes (equities, fixed income and cash or money market <br>instruments), liquid ity, dividends and time zones (Maginn, Tuttle, McLeavey & Pinto, 2007).  <br>• Power:  that is exercised by family members. Power could influence the choice of control structures and  <br>subsequent outcomes on decision making in the business.  341 <br> Although there are many c hallenges facing family businesses, some complex issues are related to the internal <br>environment of the business (leadership, transition and legal aspects) and others relate t o the external <br>environment (marketplace, competition, laws and regulations). Accor ding to Robbins, DeCenzo and Coulter <br>(2012), an organisation can be affected by a marketplace that reflects intense competition; government laws <br>and regulations, for example,  the regulations imposed by the South African government, such as tax <br>compliance, the Labour Relations Act, etc. When the family business is operating, it should consider <br>government regulations such as registering the business with the Companies and Intell ectual Property <br>Commission. It should also open a business bank account so that it  has records (financial and otherwise) of <br>paying tax or complying with the minimum wage should the need arise. This will generally depend on the <br>type of the company. All thes e issues are legally binding on a family business.  <br>Technology is another force that brings challenges to the family business, for example adapting to <br>technological advances such as cloud computing for business purposes. Fluctuations in labour markets can <br>affect the family business. The market economy also affects almost all organisations run by both family and <br>non-family members. What is evident from the literature is that the following aspects also pose a challenge.  <br>• Conflict management (interpersonal, stru ctural and strategic):  conflicts are normal in any organisation <br>because people have different opinions and there are people who cannot accept other people’s different <br>opinions. Organisational causes of conflict are consequence of the characteristics of org anisational design, <br>limited resources and character istics of organisational systems, such as compensation, decision making, <br>planning and budgeting (Petković et al., 2008).  <br>• Stable strategies:  as family businesses expand from their entrepreneurial beginnings , they  face unique <br>performance and governance chall enges. They must have strategies for the challenges they face for <br>different situations. For example, the generations that follow the founder may insist on running the <br>company even though they are not suite d for the job. And as the number of family sharehol ders increases <br>exponentially generation by generation, with few actually working in the business, the commitment to <br>carry on as owners cannot be taken for granted (Caspar, Dias & Elstrodt, 2010).  <br>• Governanc e: good governance family practices assist family b usinesses to conduct strategic planning and <br>succession appropriately.  <br>• Longevity/clan cultures:  the link between longevity and values has been pointed out by several authors who <br>underlined values as an impo rtant factor to support a long -term vision, as well  as a source of competitive <br>advantage based on using values as specific company resources (Tàpies & Fernández Moya, 2012).  <br>• Lifetime tenures/business leadership transition:  sometimes, leadership transition is not easy in a family <br>business, therefore it is e ssential to establish the rules and regulations for the transition period.  <br>According to the study conducted by PwC in 2014, the performance challenges faced by family businesses in <br>the internal and externa l environment are as follows:  <br>• Internal  <br>– Staff recr uitment  <br>– Company reorganisation  <br>– Cash flow/cost control  <br>– Succession planning  <br>– Business/product development  <br>– Availability of finance  <br>• External  <br>– Market conditions/currency uncertainty  <br>– Competition  <br>– Exports/problems in foreign markets  <br>– Government poli cy/regulation  <br>– Exchange rates  342 <br> – Availability of finance  <br>– Price of raw materials  <br>19.4.4 Succession  <br>Nieman and Nieuwenhuizen (2009) explain that succession is the process through which the leadership of th e <br>business is transferred from the existing leader to a subsequent family member or non -family member (a <br>professional manager). Only 33 per cent of fam ily businesses survive to the second generation; just 12 per <br>cent make it to the third generation; and on ly three per cent survive to the fourth generation and beyond <br>(Scarborough, 2012). According to Yang (2016), family firms generally do not survive past  the third <br>generation. In a study by Villalonga and Amit (2006) only 1.6 percent of 8 500 family firms fr om around the <br>world survived into the fourth generation, and only 0.4 per cent into the fifth. The survival rate of most African <br>family businesses is e xtremely low beyond the founder’s generation. Thus, while emerging economy family <br>businesses usually look  within the family for successors, it would be prudent to consider introducing <br>professional managers to such businesses.  <br>Effective succession mechanism s and expanding global production and networks are key to growing a family <br>business. For a business to ha ve a successful succession, Scarborough (2012) has indicated that management <br>succession processes should begin at a very young age (with the owners’ ch ildren), hence the process is <br>lengthy (refer to  Figure 19.3 ). It is a series of o verlapping stages, which in turn extend to the point of final <br>ownership transition.  <br> <br>Figure 19.3 Stages in management succession  <br> <br>Source:  Scarborough (2012: 684)  <br> <br>Poor succession planning affects the performance of family firms in emerging markets in many ways. <br>However, should the company not find a successor, the board should develop a team that shares lea dership or <br>engages the next generation of family members as managers. In addition to a strong work ethic and motivation, <br>343 <br> Scarborough (2012) indicates that the traits that are essential for a successor to lead the family business <br>include:  <br>• Financial abilitie s: understanding the financial aspects of a business, such a s what its financial position is and <br>that the managerial implications of that position are crucial to success.  <br>• Technical knowledge:  every business has its own body of knowledge, ranging from how t he distribution <br>system works to the trends shaping the indus try, which an executive must master.  <br>• Negotiating ability:  much of business, whether buying supplies and inventory or selling to customers, boils <br>down to negotiating, and a business owner must be a dept at it.  <br>• Leadership qualities:  leaders must be bold enoug h to stake out the company’s future and then give <br>employees the resources, the power, and the freedom to pursue it.  <br>• Communication skills:  business leaders must communicate the vision they have for  their businesses; good <br>listening skills are also essential for success as a top manager.  <br>• Juggling skills:  business owners must be able to handle multiple projects effectively. Like a juggler, they must <br>maintain control over several important assignments s imultaneously.  <br>• Integrity:  to be an effective leader of a fam ily business, a successor must demonstrate honesty and integrity <br>in business dealings.  <br>• Commitment to the business:  it helps if a successor has a genuine passion for the business.  <br>Leaders who have enthusiasm for what they do create a spark of excitement thr oughout the entire organisation. <br>It is therefore vital that the right person (family member or non -family member) is put in the right position to <br>ensure the success of the business. Nieman and Nie uwenhuizen (2009) also highlight barriers to succession, <br>which could be: an autocratic founder who does not want to transfer leadership; denial of mortality; a child -<br>stays -child scenario in which the child cannot tell the parent what to do; misinterpretati on of environmental <br>trends by the leader who does not implem ent changes in time; inability to choose a successor; or choosing a <br>successor who will be a “slave”; bias against planning; and an inability to face retirement.  <br>19.5 FAMILY BUSINESS IN THE AFRICAN  CONTEXT  <br>Owing to the limited information regarding family businesses in emerging countries, particularly Brazil, <br>Russia and India (Bruton, Ahlstrom & Obloj, 2008), there is a call for a strong need to develop an <br>understanding of entrepreneurship in emergi ng econom ies (Peng, 2000). According to Bruton, Ahlstrom & <br>Obloj (2008), while there are similarities across various emerging economies, each one has distinctive <br>characteristics (e.g.  the country’s history and geography, and the size and strength of the ec onomy). H ence <br>Bhalla (2015) states that the performance and evolvement of family businesses differ from developed <br>countries.  Table 19.2  gives a few examples that show how family businesses in emerging economies differ <br>from those in developing countries.  <br>Economic informality is part of the institutional context of business in Africa , and a m ajor economic force in <br>most emerging nations (Khavul, Bruton & Wood, 2009). However, there are great stories regarding family <br>businesses in Africa that have been in existence for many years. A study conducted by Dana Sanchez in <br>the AFKInsider  news letter on  9 January 2014, on the Forbes’ Top 10 Family Businesses in Africa identified <br>businesses in Uganda, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria and Tanzania. This is an indication that there are many <br>successful businesses on the continent. However, there is a co mmon tren d noted by researchers that the owners <br>who manage family businesses in the African context often die without their successors being fully prepared <br>to take over the family business (Forrest, 1994: 237; Kakuru, 2015).  344 <br> 19.6 A SOUTH AFRICAN PERSPECTIV E <br>South A frica’s historical background, infrastructure and advancement contribute to the operation of family <br>businesses. More than 80 per cent of all businesses have family -ownership involvement, and more than 60 per <br>cent of all listed companies in South A frica com prised family involvement at least during the start -up phase <br>(Dickinson, 2000; Venter, 2002 as cited in Van Buuren, 2009). A large proportion of family businesses in <br>South Africa are small -to-medium sized enterprises, with nearly 50 per cent emplo ying fewe r than 20 people <br>per business (Maas, 1999, as cited in Van Buuren, 2009). According to Botha, Brand, Engelbrecht and <br>Eijbergen (2015: 240), the World Bank and International Finance Cooperation ranked South Africa as number <br>39 out of 185 countries in the wo rld on the ease of doing business in 2012 (Business, 2013). South Africa is <br>famous for having an infrastructural advantage when compared to its counterparts on the African continent. <br>Some of the other competitive advantages possessed by South Afri ca includ e: marketing advantages; access <br>to labour and career opportunities; access to capital; and production of products or services. Businesses like <br>Pick n Pay are living proof of a successful family business as indicated in the next case study.  <br>However , it is n ot all bright in South Africa when it comes to entrepreneurship, particularly with regard to the <br>family business.  <br>Pick n Pay, founded in 1966 by Raymond Ackerman, South Africa  <br>When Raymond Ackerman was fired from a job as managing director at Sout h African  food retailer Checkers in 1966, he used <br>his severance pay to buy three retail outlets in Cape Town, which traded under the name Pick n Pay. Raymond built Pick n <br>Pay into one of the most popular and largest retail outlets in South Africa on his re putation as a champion of consumers who <br>fought supplier cartels of bread, gas, cigarettes and other industries. Pick n Pay now has close to 800 stores in southern Af rica. <br>Raymond stepped down as executive chairman in 2010, and his son Gareth Ackerman took over as c hairman. Pick n Pay is <br>the second -largest supermarket chain in South Africa, losing significant market share in the last few years to rivals Woolworths <br>and Shoprite while struggling to adopt new information technology and distribution systems. Pic k n Pay i s listed on the JSE, <br>but remains a family business. The Ackerman Family Trust owns 53 per cent of stock and Gareth’s siblings occupy senior <br>positions in the company. Suzanne Ackerman -Berman is a company director. Jonathan Ackerman is executive dir ector.  <br>19.6.1 Challenges of a family business in South Africa  <br>In South Africa, 70 per cent of all first -generation family -owned businesses fail in their efforts to hand over <br>to the second generation (Family Business Association of South Africa, 2017). More over, th e survey by PPS <br>(2016) indicated that 60 per cent of South African graduates would rather secure employment. Based on the <br>research by PPS (2016), one can argue that South African graduates fear taking risks and will therefore avoid <br>undertaking entr epreneur ial opportunities.  <br>Brink (2013) indicates other challenges as follows:  <br>• South African family -business owners reported a lack of confidence in the government, with the majority <br>believing that the government is not doing enough to help family business es survi ve and develop their <br>activities in the current economic climate  <br>• Red tape  <br>• An inflexible labour market  <br>• An increase in electricity tariffs  <br>• A lack of tax incentives  <br>• Overregulation  <br>• Uncertainty around government policy  <br>• An inadequate education policy  <br>• Dete rioration in the country’s infrastructure, which remains the greatest constraint to the growth of family -<br>owned businesses in South Africa  <br>Other observed challenges in South African family businesses include  <br>• overreliance o n state patronage for business whic h is detrimental towards the sustainability of the family <br>business  345 <br> • deficiencies in managing a family business  <br>• conflict of interest and the failure of the business  <br>• tendency to delay the hand over until it is too late (succ ession).  <br>Family businesses continue  to face many challenges, particularly in the townships. Research points to the <br>economic crisis and moral issues as some of the inevitable challenges. Therefore issues such as the country’s <br>history contribute to the misfo rtunes of a society that is hesitan t to take risks. Other issues include  <br>• culture (how people have been brought up)  <br>• red tape from government and the private sector.  <br>There are still family businesses that do not want to comply with the standards required by government. A <br>good example would be  that of the Gupta family from India who own businesses internationally, particularly <br>the two brothers (Ajay and Atul). According to Comrie (2016), since 2008, two Gupta -linked companies – <br>Advanced Investments and Fidelit y Enterprises – received transfers of shares from Oakbay Investments, <br>making these companies at various times indirect shareholders in a number of Gupta businesses, including <br>television (Infinity Media), mining (Tegeta Exploration and Resources) and manufa cturing (VR lasers).  <br>A study by McK insey & Company (2014) reports crucial indicators of long -term corporate health that were <br>found in a family business. These include: family values that were part of day -to-day operations; the ability <br>to reduce certain age ncy dilemmas in emerging markets in  particular; a demonstrable, even dominant home -<br>field advantage; and the gravitas that families bring to deal making.  <br>19.6.2 Prospects going forward  <br>There is a call from researchers and companies to professionalise family  businesses. The survey conducted b y <br>PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in 2014 acknowledges that in order for family businesses to gain ground, <br>professionalising the family businesses remains a key concern driven by a storm of competitive pressure, <br>rising costs  and global megatrends (PwC, 2014).  The research identified three distinct areas where family <br>businesses need to professionalise their operations; these include: basic work around systems and processes; <br>corporate governance; and people management (PwC, 201 4). Formalisation and modernisation  have been <br>practised by family businesses in both developing and emerging economies without being formally <br>acknowledged. Although developed countries may view practices in emerging economies as informal, these <br>have been w orking for some time. For example, Writer (2017) reported that in South Africa, the taxi business <br>generates more than R90 billion every year.  <br>An interesting piece of work by Steward and Hitt (2012) identifies six modes of professionalisation by family <br>firms. In their survey, the argument wa s that family firms should behave more like non -family firms and <br>“professionalise” their businesses. Six ideal types of professionalising were identified as follows:  <br>1. Minimally professional family firms:  firms that lack th e capacity for extensive profession alisation, <br>limited professionalisation on multiple dimensions  <br>2. Wealth dispensing, private family firms:  firms that seek the private benefits of control with their own <br>capital, desiring independence from external governance  <br>3. Entrepreneurially operated family firms:  firms that pursue the opportunities found in informal <br>operations, limited in the use of formalis ation and standardisation  <br>4. Entrepreneurial family business groups:  firms that pursue the opportunities found in networks of <br>affiliated firms, remaining em bedded in kinship and other normative orders  <br>5. Pseudoprofessional, public family firms:  firms that seek the private benefits of control with other <br>people’s money, seeking the appearance while violating the spirit of public governance  <br>6. Hybrid professional fami ly firms:  professionally managed, family -controlled firms that seek the benefits <br>of pr ofessionalisation while retaining family influence  <br>Steward and Hitt (2012) acknowledge the limitation in their work; however, they state that although <br>“professionalisatio n” is often treated as a singular construct, it entails multiple dimensions.  346 <br> 19.7 CON CLUSION  <br>In order for a family business to survive and grow in a constantly changing environment it is important for the <br>business to stay entrepreneurial at its core.  <br>Altho ugh there are challenges and barriers that the family business encounters daily, the opportunities to start, <br>develop and grow a successful business for current and future generations are available, particularly in <br>developing economies.  <br>REVIEW QUESTIONS  <br>1.

He began importing and retailing them through a company he founded, Italtile. In the wake of the 1976 Soweto <br>uprising when the first hints of trade sanctions against South Africa were surfacing Mr Ravazz otti began manufacturing ceramic <br>tiles domestically. In 1992, Italtile and manufacturer Ceramic Industries were listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. <br>Today the group’s retail operation comprises a total network of 126 stores in southern and East Afric a, which are strategically <br>supported by a vertically integrated supply chain, investments in key suppliers and a property investment portfolio. From the  <br>founding of Italtile to the launching of various brands, support divisions and products over the years,  Italtile expanded <br>enormously. While Italtile was aimed at the high -end markets, the next step was to penetrate all other market segments, hence <br>in 1983 the first CT M store was launched and from that the franchising of CTMs began in 1992. CTMs were establi shed with <br>the middle -to-upper market in mind. Such accelerated advancements in the market propelled the group to broaden their <br>expansion internationally, which led t o trading  in Australia in 1998. Within three years of their decision, Italtile had rooted <br>themselves in multiple states in Australia. In 2008 TopT was launched, the brand that was designed to cater for the entry -level <br>markets. In 2004, Italtile had acquire d controlling interest in two of its key suppliers, ITD (International Tap Distributors) – a <br>tap importer and distributor and Early -works (Pty) Ltd – an importer and distributor of tiling tools and hardware. With such <br>constant aggressive progress and growt h, the group launched a tiling and plumbing academy in Gauteng in 2009.  <br>The property invest ment portfolio reinforces retail operations by locating stores in high -profile, easily accessible sites, and <br>maintaining and upgrading premises ensures an optimum sh opping environment. Stores are located in high -visibility sites and, <br>together with their co mprehensive offerings, this positions them as one -stop solution destinations, with ranges including: <br>ceramic and porcelain wall and floor tiles; sanitaryware; bathro om furniture; taps; fittings; laminated wooden flooring; and <br>home -finishing products and to ols. <br>Italtile pursues corporate entrepreneurship and innovation by fostering innovative behaviour within their organisation. The <br>group promotes such behaviour in the ir high level of flexibility to adapt, speedily and aggressively, to the complexities of th e <br>changing external and internal environments. Employees are encouraged to think like entrepreneurs by engaging in profit -<br>sharing practices aimed at promoting owners hip and partnership in the business, with the introduction of the franchise and <br>joint-ventu res business model. Complementing this long -standing tradition of Italtile, they have also implemented an equity -<br>settled staff share scheme designed to further incen tivise employees to participate in the growth and profitability of the <br>business. Italtile p rides itself on placing an immense amount of emphasis on continuous improvement in its logistics/service <br>delivery and production. Being regarded as an industry leade r with notable market share, the group entrenches its reputation <br>as a fashion icon by: cond ucting continuous, comprehensive consumer research; employing experienced, skilled brand and 350 <br> divisional managers and dedicated buyers who specialise in key products and areas; holding regular regional meetings to <br>obtain insight into markets and product fee dback; monitoring and adjusting costs and pricing as appropriate; constantly <br>refreshing store displays and trading space; and sharing best practice principles across  the group. The group’s recently opened <br>Cape Town distribution centre is advancing the goal  to improve distribution and the logistics of imported products as well as <br>to enhance performance in the region.  <br>Source:  Adapted from Ramsuran (2016)  <br>20.1 INTRODUCTI ON <br>Corporate entrepreneurship (CE) or intrapreneurship has been of interest to scholars and  practitioners for <br>decades. CE is a broad concept at the centre of which is the process of organisational renewal. It is accepted <br>by academics and practitioners as a le gitimate route towards increased levels of organisational performance. <br>This chapter is a imed at introducing the reader to the concept of corporate entrepreneurship and its <br>significance. It further unpacks the reasons why established organisations consider or pursue corporate <br>entrepreneurship as part of organisational renewal. Organisations ar e forced to respond to the changing domain <br>of the corporate environment as a result of micro and macro environmental factors. For the reader to have a <br>broader understan ding of the concept, this chapter starts by differentiating between start -up entrepreneu rship <br>and corporate entrepreneurship and then moves to the main concept of corporate entrepreneurship (also <br>referred to in this study as intrapreneurship) as the subjec t of study. Furthermore, the concept of <br>entrepreneurial intensity is discussed and a sup porting case study is provided.  <br>20.2 UNDERSTANDING CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP  <br>Corporate Entrepreneurship (CE) in simple terms is just a way of organisational revival an d <br>transformation.  Though its definition has been the subject of debate for many scholars , the concept of <br>corporate entrepreneurship (sometimes referred to as intrapreneurship) generally refers to the development of <br>new and original ideas and opportunities within established businesses, with direct impact on the improvement <br>of organisational p rofit and thus the enhancement of competitiveness or the strategic renewal of an existing <br>organisation. Covin and Miles (1999) argue that CE can be used to improve comp etitive positioning and <br>transform corporations, their markets and industries as opportun ities for value -creating innovation are <br>developed and exploited. In order for one to understand the concept of CE, one should start by the definition <br>of an entrepreneur  and then CE itself.  <br>20.2.1 Definition of an entrepreneur  <br>An entrepreneur is an individu al who conceives the idea of starting a new venture, takes all types of risks, not <br>only to put the product or service into reality but also to make it one in high demand. Therefore, <br>entrepreneurship is defined as the willingne ss to take risks and develop, organise and manage a business <br>venture in a competitive global marketplace that is constantly evolving. Entrepreneurs are pioneers, <br>innovators, leaders and inventors.  <br>20.2.2 Definition of a corporate entrepreneur  <br>A corporate e ntrepreneur is an entrepreneur  within the boundaries of the organisation (big or small) innovating <br>for that organisation. A corporate entrepreneur is an employee of an established entity, who has the support <br>and authority to initiate creative projects and innovation within the company’ s existing products and services, <br>redesigning the processes, workflows and systems with the objective of transforming them into a successful <br>venture of the enterprise. According to Kurakto, Morris and Covin (2011), corporate e ntrepreneurship is a 351 <br> process w hereby an individual or a group of individuals, in association with an existing organisation, creates <br>a new organisation or instigates renewal or innovation within the organisation. CE is a term used to describe <br>entrepreneuria l behaviour inside established  organisations.  <br>Like an independent entrepreneur, the corporate entrepreneur believes in change and does not fear failure as <br>he or she discovers new ideas, passionately looks for opportunities that can benefit the whole organi sation and <br>takes calculated ri sks. Most fortunately for the entrepreneur, the resources are provided by the organisation. <br>Despite these resources, the job of corporate entrepreneurs is at times challenging; hence they are appreciated <br>and rewarded according ly by the organisation. In rec ent times, it has become a trend that established <br>corporations appoint corporate entrepreneurs within the organisational ranks to promote excellence in the <br>business.  <br>20.3 REASONS WHY ESTABLISHED ORGANISATIONS CONSIDER OR PURSU E <br>CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP?  <br>The importance of corporate entrepreneurship for organisations cannot be overemphasised; it enables <br>organisations that were traditionally averse to risk embracing innovation, and driving leaders and venture <br>teams toward an inc reased level of corporate ente rprising. In addition to the benefits expressed above, it also <br>sets the stage for leadership continuity in the organisation. Therefore, it is imperative for organisations to <br>reinvent themselves continually if they want to rema in relevant and in existence. For organisations that have <br>a specific focus on innovation, there is an equal drive toward corporate venturing. These two work hand in <br>hand when the company undertakes innovations across the entire organisational spectrum, fro m product and <br>process to techn ology and administration. It is important to note that corporate venturing takes centre stage in <br>the whole process. Kuratko and Hodgetts (2007) indicate that the need for corporate entrepreneurship has <br>arisen in response to a number of pressing problems. E xamples of these pressing problems include the <br>following:  <br>• Rapid growth in the number of new and sophisticated competitors  <br>• Sense of distrust in the traditional methods of corporate management  <br>• An exodus of some of the best and b rightest people from corporati ons to become small business <br>entrepreneurs  <br>• International competition  <br>• Downsizing of major corporations  <br>• An overall desire to improve efficiency and productivity  <br>Hisrich, Peters and Shepperd (2005) emphasise that it is important to keep and instil the entrepr eneurial spirit <br>in a business in order to innovate and grow. Stevenson and Jarillo (1990) point out that corporate <br>entrepreneurship has grown in significance over the years because large businesses wishing to compete have <br>soug ht out the characteristics of flexibility, growth and innovation more generally associated with <br>entrepreneurship. If a business does not adopt a proactive attitude towards innovation and the creation of new <br>ventures, it is unlikely to survive (according to  Johnson (2001), in an increas ingly aggressive, competitive and <br>dynamic marketplace.  <br>20.4 DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN START -UP ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND CORPORATE <br>ENTREPRENEURSHIP  <br>The terms entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship are frequently used in today’s world of business. Many <br>people use t hese terms interchangeably with a belief that the meaning is the same. However, there exists a fine <br>line between these two concepts. While en trepreneurship refers to a person who starts his own business with 352 <br> a new idea or concept, intrapreneurship or corpo rate entrepreneurship represents an employee within the <br>boundaries of an established organisation who acts entrepreneurially.  Table 20.1  shows the important points <br>of difference between a start -up entrepreneur and a co rporate entrepreneur.  <br>Table 20.1 Major differences between a start -up entrepreneur and a corporate entrepreneur  <br>Start-up entrepreneurship  Corporate entrepreneurship  <br>Entrepreneur takes the risk  Company assumes the risks, other than career -related risk  <br>Entrepreneur “owns” the concept or <br>innovative idea  Company owns the concept and typically the intellectual rights surr ounding <br>the concept  <br>Entrepreneur owns all or much of the <br>business  Entrepreneur may have no equity in the company, or a very small <br>percentage  <br>Potential rewards for the entrepreneur are <br>theoretically unlimited  Clear limits are placed on the financial rewar ds entrepreneurs can receive  <br>One misstep can mean failure  More roo m for errors, company can absorb failure  <br>Vulnerable to outside influence  More insulated from outside influence  <br>Independence of the entrepreneur; <br>although the successful entrepreneur is <br>typically backed by a strong team  Interdependence of the champion wit h many others; may also have to <br>share credit with any number of people  <br>Flexibility in changing course, <br>experimenting or trying new directions  Rules, procedures and bureaucracy hinder the e ntrepreneur’s ability to <br>manoeuvre  <br>Speed of decision making  Longer  approval cycles  <br>Little security  Job security  <br>No safety net  Dependable benefit package  <br>Few people to talk to  Extensive network for bouncing around ideas  <br>Limited scale and scope initiall y Potential for sizeable scale and scope fairly quickly  <br>Severe resource limitations  Access to finances, R&D, production facilities for trial runs, an established <br>sales force, an existing brand, distribution channels that are in place, <br>existing databases a nd market research resources, and an established <br>customer base  <br>Source:  Kurakto et al. (2011)  <br> 353 <br> 20.5 THE CHANGING DOMAIN OF THE CORPORATE ENVIRONMENT  <br>In today’s business environment, traditional large organisations compete with smaller players for the best and <br>brightest talent. In the near future, developing and retaining leaders with entrepreneurial spirit will become a <br>nightmare for established organi sations if they do not change their traditional practices as smaller players <br>make an impact on the market. When leading organisations seem to be falling behind in sectors where they <br>used to be dominant, there is a clear acknowledgement that the status quo can no longer be maintained. There <br>are many examples of sectors where dominant figures disappeared for good . Think of BlackBerry with its <br>popular BBM that suddenly disappeared; and Nokia (once a leading cellular company) also disappeared. <br>While Samsung see ms to lead the market, there is a fear that Huawei might soon be a dominant figure with <br>their latest offeri ngs catching and disrupting the market. In order to develop a strategy for coping with <br>unpredictable market events, challenges and crises, organisati ons have to embrace change in order to survive. <br>Corporate leaders need to create a conducive work environme nt that does not only survive a crisis, but also <br>capitalises on the disruptive changes as market opportunities.  <br>According to Njuguna (2014), organisa tional survival requires that the methods leaders use to learn and to <br>impart operational knowledge must cha nge as fast or faster than the environmental changes that threaten <br>viability. The new strategy for business leaders should be a constant adaptation t o change to catch up with the <br>changing ecosystem. Furthermore, Matai (2011) explains that to achieve this, the focus should be on looking <br>beyond competition and market share to a more fundamental question of survival and sustainability in a <br>turbulent and c ontinuously changing environment. For organisational leadership and corporate entrepreneurs, <br>it is importan t to understand the role and responsibility of their organisation in the context of the whole <br>environment. Matai (2011) has identified the following factors that organisations should take note of. These <br>are listed next:  <br>• Fatal attack:  becoming preoccupied w ith the competition is as short -sighted as it would have been for the <br>dinosaurs to peg their survival on competition with the amphibians. The dinosaurs dropped out of the <br>picture not because they were beaten by any other type of creat ure but simply because  they could not <br>respond successfully to the challenge of a changing environment. Given their large size, their response <br>time from head to tail was inadequate. The time it took them to receive information from their tail to <br>brain and b ack again left them co mpletely vulnerable to fatal attack.  <br>• Agility and speed of response:  agility and a shorter response time are key to survival in today’s competitive <br>business environment. According to Matai (2011), a large organisation with multiple sil os that remain <br>isolate d, can become too big to change. So the question is: how can large organisations be split into <br>smaller autonomous ones so that their inertia is minimised and response times become shorter?  <br>• Market share:  a rapidly changing environment such as the one in whi ch organisations find themselves offers <br>only very short -term victories to those organisations that set out to beat their competitors or to capture <br>more market share. The long -term advantage lies with those organisations that focus on the environment <br>as a w hole and not just on the competition. It is not by competing for market share but by capitalising on <br>change that today’s organisations can survive, achieve sustainability and thrive.  <br>• Challenge and response time:  the key to success in a time of deep and sys temic change lies in focusing on <br>the challenge and response time. In a dynamic marketplace, every level of the organisation must see its <br>situation as a challenge, calling not for compliance but for creative response via change managem ent. <br>When this begins to happen intuitively, people are no longer victims trying to cope the best way they can. <br>They recover a sense of control and purpose in what they are doing by changing their knowledge base and <br>attitude as the starting steps.  <br>• Change t he mindset:  as corpora te entrepreneurs and leaders, it is essential to recognise that many within <br>the organisation have an aversion to change. Helping them to confront the inevitable with confidence and <br>enthusiasm is a primary responsibility of the 21st -century leader’s job.  354 <br> 20.6 SETTING UP THE CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURIAL ENVIRONMENT  <br>In today’s business environment, one of the primary tasks of the business leader is to foster an environment <br>in which entrepreneurial thinking is encouraged and readily takes pla ces (May, 2012). May ( 2012) goes on to <br>say that promoting this culture by freely encouraging creativity (and thereby innovation), business leaders <br>motivated toward corporate entrepreneurship must continuously strive to exude and build trust, embracing the <br>risk to fail and inspi ring those around them to take similar calculated risks. In order for business leaders to set <br>the stage for a corporate entrepreneurial climate, the following three steps apply:  <br>Step 1:  Set a broad direction for achievement, re -evalua ting it periodically f or any new developments in the <br>business environment.  According to May (2012), this includes competitive products and markets in which the <br>firm is operating. Constant evaluation is essential at this stage as even the most finely -tuned direction can still <br>lead to catastrophic failure if the approach is no longer working.  <br>Step 2:  Reinforce efforts across the entire organisation that coincides with the current plan for <br>achievement.  One significant role of a business leader is that of analy st. As business units continue their <br>experiment with existing products and services, as well as innovating and developing new ones, business <br>leaders or executives can boost their goals to reinforce those units and thereby achieve the highest degree of <br>success. <br>Step 3:  Instil a corporate entrepreneurial mindset at all levels in the organisation.  This can be done through <br>training and allowing for participation in entrepreneurial events hosted by other entrepreneurial development <br>organisations. An employee wit h an entrepreneurial m indset views his or her work or job as “his or her own <br>business”. An entrepreneurial mindset is about taking ownership and responsibility of who you are and what <br>you do. You take ownership of your work and job as if it is your company . This approach can re ally accelerate <br>your brand and reputation in the workplace.  <br>20.7 CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURIAL MINDSET  <br>As an executive or a corporate entrepreneur in the organisation, one needs to be able to shift employees and <br>colleagues from an employe e mindset to an entrep reneurial one. Corporate entrepreneurship in many <br>organisations succeeds when employees are provided with freedom and supported to develop their own ideas. <br>According to Kurakto (2014), the major thrust of corporate entrepreneurship in novation is the develo pment <br>of an entrepreneurial spirit within the organisational boundaries. Researchers on corporate entrepreneurship <br>state that entrepreneurial firms differ from firms that do not have an entrepreneurial mindset by manifesting <br>character istics such as autonom y, innovation, risk taking, proactivity and competitive aggressiveness (Urban <br>& Oosthuizen, 2009). Additionally, such firms engage in entrepreneurship strategies such as corporate <br>venturing, which create new businesses or strategic en trepreneurship, which is the strategic renewal and <br>positioning of an organisation (Kuratko, Morris & Covin, 2011; Dess & Lumpkin, 2005).  <br>20.7.1 Characteristics of an entrepreneurial mindset  <br>Raizcorp (2017) highlighted the following six characteristics of an entrepreneurial mind set that are shared by <br>successful entrepreneurs.  <br>1. Perseverance:  the ability to withstand repeated rejection and disappointment is an essential part of an <br>entrepreneur’s makeup. Successful entrepreneurs are able to draw lessons from re jection, as well as <br>prevent it from damaging their self -esteem. Essentially, the corporate entrepreneur, together with the <br>team of employees and colleagues, must be able to deflect the rejection and use it to spur them on to <br>fix flaws in the business ventu re. 355 <br> 2. Flexibility:  an abi lity to design company strategies, processes and operational approaches that can <br>simultaneously meet the diverse and evolving requirements of stakeholders (such as customers, <br>distributors, suppliers, financiers, regulators, etc). Une xpected challenges and problems are part of the <br>game. So the corporate entrepreneur and the  team must be flexible enough in their thinking to roll with <br>the punches, solve problems as soon as they crop up, and recover quickly from setbacks.  <br>3. High internal lo cus of control:  success ful entrepreneurs have faith in their ability to determine their <br>own success. They see that their own actions, decisions and responses are what will make or break them <br>– not what the outside world throws at them. This mindset should also be instilled in th e broader team.  <br>4. Learning and iteration:  when a problem occurs, a successful entrepreneur sees it as a learning <br>opportunity. The lessons an entrepreneur takes from any given situation are then used in successive <br>iterations of the entrepreneur’s ideas to dev elop and refine them.  <br>5. Curiosity:  a wide -ranging curiosity about how the world works and where things tie together is <br>extremely common among successful entrepreneurs. This behaviour strengthens the entrepreneur’s <br>ability to see things from different angles and think laterally.  <br>6. Optimism:  despite a ll the difficulties inherent in the entrepreneurial lifestyle, successful entrepreneurs <br>maintain an optimistic view of life and the world. Being optimistic about a situation could mean the <br>difference between seeing i t as an unsolvable problem or an opportu nity to be explored.  <br>20.8 EXPLORING THE DIMENSIONS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED <br>CORPORATION  <br>In order to assess how entrepreneurial an organisation is, we use the four dimensions below:  <br>1. Opportunity recogn ition:  an organisation that constantly l ooks for opportunities is deemed to be <br>entrepreneurial in its nature. Once entrepreneurs have developed the idea, they must begin the process <br>of assessing whether or not the idea is in fact a viable business opportun ity. <br>2. Risk taking:  involves a willingness  to pursue opportunities that have a reasonable likelihood of <br>producing losses or significant performance discrepancies. If it is approached in terms of loss, a given <br>course of action is riskier depending upon both t he probability of loss and the magnitude  of loss. The <br>more risks the organisation takes the more entrepreneurial it becomes. However, the emphasis is on <br>moderate and calculated risk.  <br>3. Innovativeness:  refers to the extent to which an organisation does things  in novel ways. Pressure to <br>innovate can  be the result of external forces, including the emergence of improved technologies, the <br>globalisation of markets, fragmentation of markers, government deregulation and dramatic change. It is <br>the number and frequency  of innovations the company brings that makes it more entrepreneurial.  <br>4. Proactiveness (proactivity):  this is the opposite of reactiveness, the term is used to describe an action <br>orientation. It can be viewed as a dimension of strategy making. Proactiveness is concerned with taking <br>responsibility and doing whatever is necessary to bring an entrepreneurial concept to fruition.  <br>20.9 ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENSITY  <br>Entrepreneurial intensity (EI) refers to the assessment of the overall level of entrepreneurship in a co mpany <br>by combining the degree of entrepr eneurship (opportunity -seeking behaviour, level of innovativeness, <br>proactiveness and risk -taking) and the frequency of entrepreneurship (the number of entrepreneurial events <br>that take place in a given time period). I t has been implied that because CE is a quality that can vary in degree <br>and intensity, entrepreneurial intensity can therefore be measured. Organisations need to find ways to measure <br>and reward entrepreneurship within its structures, both in terms of its f requency and the rigour with which it <br>is pursued. This can only be achieved if measures are developed to track organisations’ entrepreneurial 356 <br> performance variables. It is important that one measure this characteristic of an organisation at both an <br>individu al personality level, as well as at a st ructural and cultural level.  <br>A company’s entrepreneurial strategy is effectively defined according to where it falls as depicted on the grid <br>in Figure 20.1 . <br>Figure 20.1 Entrepreneurial grid  <br> <br>Source:  Kuratko et al. (2011)  <br> <br>Each of these scenarios reflects the variable nature of EI. For exam ple, where fewer entrepreneurial events are <br>produced and these events are only nominally innovative, risky and/or proactive, the organisation can be <br>described as periodic/incremental in te rms of its level of EI. Similarly, the organisation that is responsi ble for <br>numerous entrepreneurial events that are highly innovative, risky and proactive will fit into the revolutionary <br>segment of the entrepreneurial matrix and will show the highest leve l of EI. Any organisation can be highly <br>entrepreneurial at some time s and not necessarily entrepreneurial at others. Consequently, they could occupy <br>different points in the grid at different periods in time.  <br>20.10 CORPORATE VENTURING AS A WAY TO MANIFEST E NTREPRENEURSHIP IN THE <br>ORGANISATION  <br>Corporate venturing has been des cribed as the activity of a large company investing money in a smaller <br>company in return for a share of its profits.  <br>The concept of corporate venturing has existed for many years in the United States where many of the top <br>companies have a venture -capital f und or offer strategic alliances. The larger firm hopes to make a return on <br>its investment when the company is sold or floats on a stock exchange. While the number of companies <br>involved is much smaller in South Africa, it ha s also existed for many years an d in different sectors.  <br>De Bettignies and Chemla (2008) define corporate venturing as the creation of new ventures by large, <br>established companies, inside the organisation or outside, through various financing models and <br>357 <br> developmental strategies. Tradition ally corporate venturing has appealed to high -growth sectors such as <br>pharmaceutical or technology companies. Small, flexible companies in these sectors can challenge industry <br>leaders with new technology that can revolutionis e the marketplace.  <br>As highlighte d earlier in the chapter, entrepreneurship can be manifested in organisations through corporate <br>venturing. Kurakto et al. (2011) provide three modes of corporate venturing that organisations can follow;  <br>1. Internal corporate ve nturing:  this type of business i s created and owned by the corporation itself. Most <br>corporate entrepreneurs and executives in large established firms probably agree that internal <br>corporate venturing (ICV) is an important avenue for corporate growth and div ersification. However, <br>there is a general consensus that new business development is not an activity for the impatient. In a <br>large sample study of firms attempting to diversify through internal development, Ralph Biggadike <br>found that it takes on average ab out eight years for a venture to  reach profitability, and about 10 to 12 <br>years before its return on investment (ROI) equals that of mainstream business activities (Burgelman & <br>Välikangas, 2005).  <br>2. Cooperative corporate venturing:  this is entrepreneurial acti vity in which new businesses are  created <br>and owned by the corporation together with one or more external development partners. As there are <br>good business and accounting reasons to create a joint venture with a company that has <br>complementary capabilities an d resources, such as distributio n channels, technology, or finance, joint <br>ventures are becoming an increasingly common way for companies to form strategic alliances. In a joint <br>venture, two or more companies agree to share capital, technology, human resour ces, and risks and <br>rewards in a formation of a new entity under shared control.  <br>3. External corporate venturing:  this is entrepreneurial activity in which new businesses are created by <br>parties outside the corporation  and subsequently invested in or acquired b y the corporation. In external <br>corporate ventures, the corporation leverages external partners in the process of creating a venture or <br>developing an internal venture.  <br>20.10.1 Advantages of corporate venturing  <br>Kunigis (2017) provides the following benefits and pitfalls of corporate ventur ing for the organisation:  <br>• Business expertise:  other than the financial backing, obtaining venture -capital financing can provide a start -<br>up or young business with a valuable source of guidance and consultation. This can help with a variety of <br>business decis ions, including financial management and human resource management. Making better <br>decisions in these key areas can be vitally important as the business continues to grow.  <br>• Legitimacy:  a corporate venture has access to its par ent’s teams of experts to perfor m diligence on the <br>venture and its products. Given the reputation of a parent company, its legitimacy cannot be put into <br>question.  <br>• Access to resources:  a corporate venture is like a child who enjoys the parents support and a ll the attention <br>in terms of res ources. This is unlike the start -up entrepreneur who normally struggles to find resources.  <br>• Support:  in a number of critical areas, including legal, tax and personnel matters, a corporate -venture firm <br>can provide active suppo rt, all the more important at a key stage in the growth of a young company. <br>Faster growth and greater success are two potential key benefits of having such support.  <br>• Connections:  venture capitalists are typically well connected in the business community. Ta pping into these <br>connections cou ld have tremendous benefits.  <br>20.10.2 Pitfalls of corporate venturing  <br>• Loss of control:  the drawbacks associated with a corporate venture (especially a cooperative venture) in <br>general can be compounded with venture -capital fin ancing. With a large injection o f cash and professional <br>and possibly aggressive investors, it is likely that your corporate -venture partners will want to be directly <br>involved. The size of their stake could determine how much say they have in shaping your c ompany’s <br>direction.  <br>• Minority own ership status:  depending on the size of the partner’s stake in your venture establishment, <br>which could be more than 50 per cent, you could lose management control. Essentially, you could be 358 <br> giving up ownership of your own bu siness and this can open up othe r areas of your business in terms of <br>losing ownership of the main business.  <br>20.10.3 Corporate venturing as a strategy  <br>For modern organisations corporate venturing has become central to achieving strategic and financial <br>objectives. Organisations can efficie ntly drive their internal innovation by deliberately using their own venture <br>companies as partners in innovation. The most successful organisations have always developed aggressive <br>venture strategies and have made corporate venturing an integral part of th eir strategic focus. According to <br>Kotelnikov (2017), in today’s corporations traditional internal expansions, efficien cy improvements and <br>synergistic acquisitions are no longer sufficient sources of growth for industry segments that had become <br>crowded and hypercompetitive. Kotelnikov (2017) continues to say the new challenge is searching for <br>emerging whitespace opportunit ies, new business creations that would meet the unmet, unserved needs of <br>customers in emerging markets.  <br>With internal ventures, establishe d organisations can discover a source of growth they have been striving to <br>achieve. Internal start -ups have become cen tral to achieving the strategic and financial objectives of market <br>leaders. There is no doubt that Silicon Valley would not have been in e xistence if large organisations had not <br>identified technology and market opportunities and moved with enough speed to capitalise on them.  <br>20.11 CONDUCIVE CLIMATE FOR CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP  <br>In modern business, one of the primary tasks of the business le ader is to foster an environment in which <br>entrepreneurial thinking is encouraged and readily takes places. Promoting t his culture  by freely encouraging <br>creativity (and thereby innovation), business leaders motivated toward corporate entrepreneurship must <br>continuously strive to exude and build trust, embracing the risk of failure and inspiring those around them to <br>take sim ilar calculated risks. According to Hornsby, Naffziger, Kuratko and Montagno (1993), organisational <br>characteristics that promote corporate  entrepreneurship are: rewards for innovation; management support of <br>entrepreneurial projects; resource availability; risk-taking; and a tolerance for failure. These characteristics <br>have been widely discussed throughout this book.  <br>20.11.1 Encouraging intra preneurial thinking  <br>Here are five steps to help restructure corporate thinking and encourage an intrapreneurial enviro nment:  <br>1. Early identification of potential intrapreneurs  <br>2. Senior management -sponsored intrapreneurial projects  <br>3. Creation of both diversity and  sequence in strategic activities  <br>4. Promotion of intrapreneurship through experimentation  <br>5. Developing a collaboration bet ween intrapreneurial participants and the organisation at large  <br> <br>20.12 ENTREPRENEURIAL LEADERSHIP  <br>Entrepreneurial leadership is effectivel y using the skills associated with successful individual entrepreneurs <br>and applying those within the environment of a larger organisation. Its aim is to cultivate entrepreneurial <br>individuals and teams that fully leverage their creative potential in creatin g value for the organisation. Kuratko <br>(2014) defines entrepreneurial leadership as the entrepreneur’s ability to antic ipate, envision, maintain 359 <br> flexibility, think strategically, and work with others to initiate changes that create a viable future for the <br>organisation. Entrepreneurial leadership does this by employing leadership practices that develop the ability <br>in employ ees to self -generate, self -reflect and self -correct in their workplace. This especially applies within <br>an organisation where those skills have been lost and replaced with a corporate mindset that focuses on <br>process, systems and risk minimisation rather tha n on entrepreneurial behaviour. The entrepreneurial leader <br>will work within a formalised organisational structure, but use the approaches normally expected of an <br>entrepreneur to identify opportunities. Once an opportunity has been identified, the team work s towards <br>creating a value proposition that will enable a rapid testing of their key assumptions. Next to an effective <br>management of risk (rather than the minimisation of risk often sought within corporate environments), they <br>are required to operate with c ontextual awareness in order to create a value proposition that delivers value to <br>the customer while taking into account the organisation’ s requirements and strategic aims (Singh, 2014).  <br>20.12.1 Essential qualities of entrepreneurial leadership  <br>As a corpor ate entrepreneur you’ll always be called upon to lead in a variety of different situations. But even <br>if you’re flying solo, you need the c harisma of leadership to convince mentors, partners, investors and <br>ultimately the employees to join your project. Ther e are, of course, other characteristics needed to achieve <br>success in one’s entrepreneurial leadership activities. The five attributes belo w will help understand the <br>organisational responsibilities, duties and obligations of an entrepreneurial leader:  <br>1. Visio n and a state of discomfort with the present:  a change agent largely depends on a state of <br>discomfort with the present, and has a vision f or how things should be, and a clear idea of the first steps <br>that need to be taken.  <br>2. Knowledge and capitalising on unfair advantages:  a classic example is that of a cooking analogy <br>explaining the concept; one can cook from a recipe by simply buying the ingr edients and making the <br>dish; or cook by looking at what you have in the cupboard and  determine what can be made with what <br>is available.  <br>3. Open minded and smart:  being open minded is a state of being unbiased and being receptive to new <br>ideas and criticisms. O ther people believe that being smart is all that is needed  to being a successful <br>executive, but wisdom, a willingness to learn new things and an acceptance of new realities and <br>viewpoints are also necessary traits for success in one’s entrepreneurial journ ey. <br>4. Honesty, integrity, trustworthiness:  these three elements enable the organisatio n to earn the loyalty <br>and goodwill of the business’s community, market and sponsors and fellow colleagues.  <br>5. The ability to adapt based on feedback:  one of the worst things o ne can do in business is to assume <br>that you’re always right. Real leaders know that input from employees, customers and other business <br>contacts is always valuable even if it isn’t always acted upon.  <br>The issue is not necessarily talent as an independent ele ment, but rather in relation to a will, desire and <br>persistence. Talent alone can eas ily disappear without these elements but talent with those characteristics <br>grows.  <br>20.13 CHALLENGES OF CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN TRADITIONAL LARGE <br>CORPORATIONS  <br>For large  corporations, discovering new businesses is their daily challenge as they continue to seek growth <br>and survival. With little or no choice, because of maturing technologies and aging product portfolios, a new <br>imperative is clear: organisations must create, develop, and sustain innovative new businesses in their existing <br>offerings. The foll owing are the challenges facing corporate entrepreneurs in traditional large corporations:  <br>• The corporate culture:  the biggest challenge facing corporate entrepreneurs is co rporate culture itself. <br>Organisational culture often encourages (or discourages) the  pursuit of entrepreneurial opportunities, <br>especially in large organisations. The question is, what needs to be done to foster a culture of creativity in 360 <br> an organisation? A ccording to Netshifefhe (2008), typical corporate culture has a climate and reward <br>system that favour conservative decision making. Risky decisions are deferred until enough hard facts can <br>be gathered or a consultant can be hired to simplify the unknown. T he guiding directives of a traditional <br>corporate culture are to adhere to instructio ns. Do not make mistakes, do not fail, and do not take <br>initiative. Within this type of culture, people wait for instructions and stay within their terrain. This <br>restrictive  environment does not encourage creativity, independence, flexibility or ownership. It also does <br>not encourage risk taking, which is the main guiding principle of intrapreneurship. Entrepreneurial culture <br>should encourage employees to be creative and innov ative so that they can experiment with new <br>products, make suggestions for improvemen ts of products and internal process, and take risks, <br>responsibility and ownership of their creations (Nayager & Van Vuuren, 2005).  <br>• Reluctance by senior management to try ne w things:  Google co -founder Larry Page once said fear of failing <br>and of doing someth ing new is very natural. It is a known fact that innovation is directly proportional to <br>the attitude of senior management. It is the actions of top managers that set the co ntext, guide the <br>process, clearly communicate, encourage and shield creative teams a s well as appreciate people and their <br>entrepreneurial thinking.  <br>• Bureaucracy:  bureaucratic regulations and rules are not very helpful when unexpected situations arise. A <br>blind adherence to rules may inhibit the exact actions necessary to achieve organisatio nal goals. A long <br>tradition in organisational sociology holds that the realities of bureaucratic life are fundamentally <br>incompatible with entrepreneurial initiative because  they create workers who are timid and less likely to <br>challenge established ways of doing things, and hence less likely to identify and act on potential <br>opportunities.  <br>• Entrepreneurial mindset and infrastructure:  one of the greatest challenges facing intrap reneurs is finding an <br>organisation that has the entrepreneurial mindset and infrastr ucture to support what they do and how <br>they do it. In order to develop an entrepreneurial mindset in an organisation, innovation should be an <br>expectation of all workers and  the accountability of all managers.  <br>• Traditional management practices:  senior manage ment is often reluctant to embrace innovative ideas and <br>tends to fixate hugely  on conventional thinking. The general principle is on enforcing the standard <br>procedures to av oid mistakes. According to Mayisela (2015), employees should be granted an <br>environme nt of “safety and freedom” to experiment with new ideas without the fear of being <br>reprimanded by senior management if their innovative ideas do not yield the expected resul ts. <br>Corporate entrepreneurship often fails because large organisations present hosti le environments for creative <br>ideas (Burgelman, 1983; Sharma & Chrisman, 1999). Innovative proposals are frequently defeated by <br>financial control systems and other formaliti es that are typical of large bureaucracies (Kanter, 2004). Creating <br>collateral organ isations, such as new venture divisions, can isolate entrepreneurial processes from the parent <br>organisation (Burgelman, 1983).  <br>20.14 OVERCOMING THE CHALLENGES OF CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN <br>TRADITIONAL CORPORATIONS  <br>People are wondering why some companies , and not just start -ups, are able to stimulate creativity and initiative <br>among their employees more effectively than others. Most executives whose companies have found suc cess <br>in fostering entrepreneurial activity share the view that no single practice en ables them to identify and capture <br>new opportunities. Supporting entrepreneurial activity depends heavily on management’s ability to trust <br>people. Entrepreneurs, like dance rs, need to be light on their feet. They need a sense of timing and room to <br>move. Ho wever, they also need to balance their freedom to explore opportunities against the discipline of the <br>marketplace (DeSimone, George, Hatsopoulos, O’Brien, Harris & Holt, 19 95). <br>According to Raeside and Ferrier (2015), for organisations to overcome the chal lenges of CE, the following <br>should be considered.  361 <br> 20.14.1 Make the organisation’s sense of purpose tangible  <br>Organisations should consider training, team building and cultur e enhancement that create a more <br>synchronised organisation with employee buy -in. In today’s business environment, people want to align <br>themselves with an organisation that has a meaningful, socially engaging corporate mission. In order to be <br>impactful and not simply a collection of words, the company’s mission must be truly lived every da y within <br>the organisation and reinforced by employee actions. Leaders of established corporations need to revisit that <br>dusty old mission statement and consider how it align s with today’s competitive marketplace, employee and <br>customer demands, and what the broader societal impact is. If gaps are present, specifically in the context of <br>management and employee behaviour, organisations should take actions as mentioned above.  <br>20.14.2 Provide more flexibility in work roles and responsibilities  <br>Provide the opportunity for individuals to work on new, innovative projects. Google is perhaps the most <br>prominent employer that encourages certain employees to allocate 20 per cent of thei r time to new projects. <br>Many other organisations, perhaps less cutting edge, have taken similar approaches, often in more limited <br>formats. An example is where a company provides employees the opportunity to work on ideas they helped <br>envision or promote. Gi ving employees a sense of “intrapreneurship” and idea ownership can be a successful <br>factor in fulfilling and retaining motivated workers. In addition, these individuals develop innovative skills, <br>build internal relationships and develop a better appreciati on of how various functions within the organisation <br>work together.  <br>20.14.3 Establish innovation tools and processes  <br>Organisations seeking to promote innovation should introduce employees to idea -generation tools, techniques <br>and case studies of success and failure. They should also be trained on innovation processes and resources that <br>are often spread across the organisation. These skills will help employees’ kick -start their ideas, enabling them <br>to drive concepts from theoretical to preliminary products.  <br>20.14 .4 Adjust rewards and recognition approaches to promote a more innovative company <br>mindset  <br>Over time organisations can develop specific reward programmes for innovative activity but initially they can <br>incorporate an innovation component into existing r eward s systems and processes. Too often there is a <br>disconnect in leadership’s desire for innovation and how employees’ innovation is recognised and rewarded. <br>This divide, often exacerbated by legacy human resources (HR) programmes, can undermine leadership ’s <br>efforts to drive an organisation towards a more innovative state. For example, encouraging controlled risk <br>taking and a more innovative environment does not have to be done via wholesale change (changing <br>everything at once). Rather, existing programmes can b e modified to support or recognise innovative activity <br>that builds impact over time. An example might be opening existing leadership development courses to “non -<br>leaders” who have demonstrated innovation initiative above the call of duty.  <br>20.14.5 Commu nicat e vision and actions  <br>By establishing a solid innovation communication framework and then maintaining a steady flow of messages <br>around new initiatives, organisations can promote the concept of innovation ubiquity. This can create a self -<br>fulfilling cycl e of employee action driving innovation -promoting behaviour and change across the <br>organisation, leading to more employee action. Too often executives and innovation leaders fail to adequately <br>and comprehensively communicate their vision, efforts, successes  and even failures throughout the <br>organisation. With an improved understanding of what motivates and engages today’s employees, larger <br>organisations can leverage their assets to better compete with younger, nimbler companies.  362 <br> 20.15 FIRM’S ENTREPRENEURIAL A UDIT  <br>In today’s entrepreneurial and competitive corporate environment, managers must devote their attention to <br>evaluating individual projects as well as the organisation as a whole, and also assess and track entrepreneurial <br>activity and outcomes. The entre prene urial audit is designed to assess the level of entrepreneurship <br>(intrapreneurship) in the organisation, determine how innovative you are and what it takes to accelerate new <br>business growth. Kurakto et al. (2011) identified three steps that attempt to measu re entrepreneurship within <br>the organisation.  <br>20.15.1 Step 1: Assessing the firm’s entrepreneurial intensity (EI)  <br>According to Kurakto et al. (2011), the entrepreneurial performance of an organisation at a given point in time <br>is reflected in its EI sco re. T o assess the degree of entrepreneurship, it is important to use the measures of the <br>four dimensions of entrepreneurship discussed in  section 20.8 . Important to note is that when interpreting EI <br>scores, one must keep in mind that norms will differ among industries. The assessment of frequency of <br>entrepreneurship involves the number of  new products and services, and process innovations introduced over <br>a defined time period.  <br>20.15.2 Step 2: Diagnosing the climate for corporate entrepreneurship  <br>Kuratko et al. (2011) propose using the Corporate Entrepreneurship Climate Instrument (CECI) fo r mea suring <br>the entrepreneurial climate of the organisation. The CECI (developed by Kuratko, Montagno and Hornsby, <br>1990), is a diagnostic tool for assessing, evaluating and managing the internal environment of the firm in a <br>manner that supports entrepreneu rship . The CECI is designed around five key antecedents:  <br>1. Management support:  the willingness of top -level managers to facilitate and promote entrepreneurial <br>behaviour.  <br>2. Work discretion/autonomy:  top-level managers’ commitment to tolerate failure, provide de cisio n-<br>making latitude and freedom from excessive oversight, and delegate authority and responsibility to <br>managers.  <br>3. Reinforcement:  developing and using systems that reinforce entrepreneurial behaviour, highlight <br>significant achievements, and encourage purs uit o f challenging work.  <br>4. Time availability:  evaluating workloads to ensure that individuals and groups have the time needed to <br>pursue innovations and that their jobs are structured in ways that support efforts to achieve short - and <br>long -term organisational  goal s. <br>5. Organisational boundaries:  precise explanations of outcomes expected from organisational work and <br>development of mechanisms for evaluation, selecting and using innovations.  <br>20.15.3 Step 3: Create an organisation -wide understanding of the corporate <br>entre preneurship/innovation process  <br>At this stage the readiness of each actor’s entrepreneurial behaviour should be thoroughly assessed. Actions <br>to enhance the entrepreneurial compe tencies of the employees involved should be set in motion. For an <br>organisation t o develop a sound programme for understanding the entrepreneurial activity, a corporate <br>entrepreneurship employee development programme can be used to help employees understand  the <br>entrepreneurial activity in the organisation. Kuratko et al. (2011) suggest  a number of elements that should <br>form part of such a programme.  <br>These elements are as follows:  <br>• The entrepreneurial experience:  review of managerial and organisational behaviou r concepts, review <br>definition of corporate entrepreneurship in relation to the o rganisation, examine the entrepreneurial <br>process and several entrepreneurial processes as applicable in established organisations.  363 <br> • Entrepreneurial breakthroughs:  present an ove rview of entrepreneurial breakthroughs in the organisation <br>and those of competit ors. With this overview, best practices can be observed and adopted by the <br>organisation.  <br>• Innovative thinking:  creativity and innovation remain a challenge for most bureaucratic  organisations. A <br>creativity check inventory list should be developed and where gaps are identified, training and a creativity <br>platform should be provided to the employees.  <br>• Idea acceleration process:  participants should be given the task of generating a se t of specific ideas they <br>would like to work on and also propose the type of reso urces needed.  <br>• Barriers, facilitators and triggers to entrepreneurial thinking:  a review of climatic factors from the CECI <br>should be done. The most common barriers to innovative  behaviour identified should be discussed and <br>dealt with.  <br>• Sustaining innovation teams:  executives and corporate entrepreneurs should work together to form <br>innovation teams based on the ideas at hand.  <br>• The corporate venture plan:  it is this stage where the g roups begin to develop a corporate venture plan, <br>which includes a step -bystep ti metable for the project’s completion.  <br>In order to conduct an entrepreneurial health audit for an organisation, it is important to provide a thorough <br>assessment of its operation s from an entrepreneurial perspective. So you are assessing how entrepreneurial a <br>company is (their entrepreneurial intensity score), what aspects of the corporate environment support or work <br>against entrepreneurial behaviour on the part of employees, and recommendations for how the company can <br>support higher levels of entrepreneurshi p. You will determine how innovative, risk taking and proactive this <br>venture is, then position the company in the entrepreneurial grid provided in  Figure 20.1 . Characterise its <br>entrepreneurial intensity, and discuss whether you think this is an appropriate level of entrepreneurial <br>intensity. The outcome will provide a clear view of how  entrepreneurial an organisation is.  <br>20.16 CONCLUSION  <br>In this chapter, we have introduced you to the concept of corporate entrepreneurship. Corporate <br>entrepreneurship is an in teresting subject and a thought -provoking one. Organisations undertaking corporat e <br>entrepreneurship must commit adequate resources to support organisational growth. There is no doubt that <br>this chapter has shown that corporate entrepreneurship is a key to b usiness success in today’s business <br>environment. Understanding corporate entrepre neurship and its processes should enhance your knowledge <br>and it is hoped that you will have developed some interest in the topic.  <br>The Foschini Group  <br>The Foschini Group Limited (FG) is a South African investment holding and retail company, with its headquar ters based in <br>Cape Town. FG is a public company consisting of a board of directors, and is currently operating under the leadership of its <br>CEO, Alexa nder Doug Murray and CFO Anthony Thunström. The structure of the company varies from operational to financi al, <br>throughout the organisation. The company provides clothing, wares and financial products to the wide middle -income group <br>all over Southern Africa  (http://www.Tfg.co.za ). FG houses several divisions, inc luding clothing, sports, jewellery and <br>homeware, as well as credit stores. Some of its well -established brands include Donna -Claire, Markham, Fabiani, Totalsports, <br>American Swiss, @home and Retail Credit Solutions (Pty) L td. Founded by George Rosenthal, th e first Foschini store opened <br>for business in 1925 in Johannesburg where it began by selling low -priced clothes imported from the US. Within the following <br>year of its first official opening, the chain expanded to nine bra nches across the country. In 1941, Foschini listed on the JSE <br>(SA), becoming one of South Africa’s first fashion retail brands to be a public company. The largest shareholder of The Fosch ini <br>Group is Coronation Asset Management, with a 20.91 per cent holdi ng as of March 2015 <br>(http://www.wsj.com ; http://www.fspinvest.co.za ). The group’s first major acquisition was made in 1967 when the American <br>Swiss Watch  Company was brought into the group  (http://www.moneyweb.co.za ). At present, the Foschini Group consists of <br>17 retail brands and over 2 000 stores in South Africa, Lesotho, Mozambique, Nigeria, Namibia , Botswana, Swaziland and <br>Zambia, e mploying about 18 000 people (http://www.Tgf.co.za ). In 2015, the company purchased the British chain Phase <br>Eight, and bought the British chain Whistles (along with its 46  stores) in March 2016, giving the company access to European <br>markets. In efforts to adopt technology and innovation, this independent chain store group also has a very strong online <br>presence.  <br>According to Efficient Equity analyst Stuart Sinclair, brand di versity is one of Foschini’s greate st strengths <br>(http://www.moneyweb.co.za ). Foschini’s businesses are greatly geared to a South African consumer recovery. As the 364 <br> company’s success is greatly determine d by the South African economy, thr eats such as rising inflation rates and stricter <br>lending criteria on the part of banks play a huge role in the productivity of the brand. Consequently, as real wage increases  <br>and inflation lowers in South Africa, consumer  spending tends to increase (http://www.moneyweb.co.za ). Another strength lies <br>in the fact that Foschini is opening new stores at a rapid pace across various regions. In this way, despite downturns in <br>economic cycles, the company create s potential for greater income and better share prices when the economy eventually <br>takes a positive turn.  <br>“For any business operating in the 21st century, corporate entrepreneurship forms a vital part of company success. It is <br>important for companies to gr asp new business, especially considering the effects of globalisation on these businesses,” says <br>Alexander Doug Murray (CEO). Wolcott and Lippitz (2010) explain that the compelling dynamic of globalisation generates <br>envir onments of increasing competition, diversifying markets, and multiplication of consumers worldwide. These factors almost <br>force companies like Foschini to constantly reinvent themselves by looking at ways to implement innovation and invest in <br>research and d evelopment within the company.  <br>Corp orate entrepreneurship remains an integral part of Foschini, especially due to the nature of the environment under which <br>this company operates. In order to be successful and excel in retail, Foschini is constantly working  towards gaining majority <br>market sh are, and spending on marketing as well as product development. These areas all require a level of innovation and <br>strategic initiative on the part of employees (mostly management) and executives. Foschini competes against other strong <br>brands such as Woolwor ths and Zara. The company also prefers rather to grow its own brand, as opposed to taking on other <br>already existing brands (such as Calvin Klein, Dolce and Gabbana).  <br>In 2015, Foschini was presented with an award from Niel sen Norman Intranet Design for deve loping an intranet solution <br>considered to be a dynamic and engaging way to facilitate internal communication and innovation. The Foschini Group became <br>one of the first African winners to receive this award since the incep tion of the Design Annual in 2001. Upon receiving the <br>award, Foschini Group’s team manager, Marius Botha, explained that companies on a quest for innovation and fresh ideas <br>need to have a strong focus on people, communication and culture. Foschini is const antly expanding and planting new st ores <br>across the continent, as well as looking for ways to remain a leading figure of success in the retail industry through its in novative <br>projects.  <br>In order to determine the EI of Foschini group, an interview with one of  Foschini store managers in Gauteng  was conducted <br>by Haynes -Smart (a final year BSc student in Informatics) in February 2016 and the following was found: a relatively stable <br>manner of welcoming the introduction of new products and services. However, it app eared that risk taking was not enco uraged <br>at both a management and an individual level in this particular workspace. This has the potential to greatly affect CE within  <br>Foschini. With regard to the CECI, a general sense of support from management was percei ved in terms of CE. With regard <br>to work discretion, there appeared to be a lack of independence as well as a sense of autonomy that should indeed be <br>cultivated in order to allow growth in CE. In terms of organisational boundaries, strict boundaries seem to  be set, which may <br>translate into i nflexibility and a sense of being rule bound, as well as a routine approach to work, which may lead to employees <br>feeling bored.  <br>However, it is quite reassuring that there are perceptions that innovative achievements are c elebrated by the company. This <br>relationship between EI and performance indicators is most noticeable for companies that operate in increasingly turbulent <br>environments. Foschini is an example of such as it competes in a very aggressive retail market and its  success is determined <br>purely by th e manner in which South Africa’s economy performs.  <br>Source:  Adapted from Haynes -Smart (2016)  <br>REVIEW QUESTIONS  <br>20.1 Discuss the concept  entrepreneurial intensity  and indicate by means of examples how this is practised at Fo schini.  <br>20.2 Entrepreneurship can b e manifested in companies through corporate venturing.

The concept of social <br>entrepreneurship (SE) has become topical and has at tracted interest from researchers and practitioners in the <br>emerging markets. The notion of SE is ordinarily known in government and non -governmental organisation <br>as non -profit and voluntary organisations (Karanda & Toledano, 2012). As a process to foster s ocial progress, <br>SE has attracted the interest of researchers and as a practice integrates economic and social value creation and <br>occurs across the globe. Social e ntrepreneurs serve as the change agents in society by way of finding new and <br>innovative ways t o solve some of the social issues within society in general. This chapter will explore the <br>concept of social entrepreneurship, its definition and its importance.  <br>21.2 THE CONCEPT OF SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP  <br>The concept of SE means different things to differ ent people and in fact remains an elusive one. Authors such <br>as Mair and Marti (2006) refer to SE as not -for-profit initiatives in search of alternative funding me chanisms <br>or management schemes in order to create social value, yet interest in SE transcends the phenomenon of <br>popularity and fascination with people. SE signals the imperative to drive social change particularly in society; <br>this intervention aims to brin g these benefits to fruition.  <br>Although the benefits provided by SE are evident to many who are  promoting the phenomenon of social <br>upliftment activities, the definition remains elusive. However, the definition has become more inclusive in <br>terms of what SE s hould entail and this provides greater understanding of what it actually entails. Rey -Marti, <br>Ribeiro -Soriano and Sanchez -Carcia (2016: 2069) believe that SE can create a sustainable  competitive edge, 368 <br> which could assist entrepreneurs in achieving social mis sions. It is understood that the provision of financial <br>support seems to be an effective way t o help social enterprise.  <br>21.3 DEFINING SOCIAL AND COMMERCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP  <br>21.3.1 Social entrepreneurship  <br>Various definitions exist and they all lead to havin g an impact on the society. In defining SE, Martin and <br>Osberg (2007) indicate that consideration is made for the fact that it consists of three components:  <br>1. “Identifying a stable but inherently unjust equi librium that causes the exclusion, marginalisation o r <br>suffering of a segment of humanity that lacks the financial means or political clout to achieve any <br>transformative benefit on its own” – this shows that in ensuring that there is comprehensive definitio n, <br>previously disadvantaged people should be part of  the beneficiary of social entrepreneurship.  <br>2. “Identifying an opportunity in this unjust equilibrium, developing a social value proposition, and bringing <br>to bear inspiration, creativity, direct action, cou rage and fortitude, thereby challenging the stable s tate’s <br>hegemony” – understandably, this component suggests that it is important to create a value add <br>towards social value and, of course, identify opportunities where there is a disparity in the system.  <br>3. “Forging a new, stable equilibrium that attempts to alleviate the suffering of the targeted group <br>(vulnerable groups), and through the creation of a stable ecosystem around the new equilibrium <br>ensuring a better future for the targeted group and even societ y at large” – what is critical here is that is <br>impor tant to establish a pathway that will create a new equitable system, which intends to bring about <br>a better life for all those people who were previously marginalised. This essentially aims at ensuring a <br>better life for all.  <br>Other authors such as Peredo and  McLean (2006) define SE as the development of innovative, mission -<br>supporting earned income, job creation, ventures undertaken by social entrepreneurs and/or non -profit <br>organisations. “Social” in the cont ext of this chapter should be understood as adding t o society in three areas, <br>(i) economic benefit to the society; (ii) ecological benefit to the environment; and (iii) social benefit to people <br>and their quality of life. Finally, social entrepreneurship is  a term that captures a unique approach to economic <br>and social problems, which cuts across sectors and disciplines that stem from certain values and processes that <br>are common to each SE irrespective of focus area.  <br>As it can be noted from above, SE is more about social upliftment characterised by recognition , evaluation <br>and exploitation of opportunities that result in social value, which involves the provision of basic needs, for <br>instance, food provision, and education and health -care services. Social vision  is regarded as a fundamental <br>matter for differentia ting social entrepreneurship from other types of entrepreneurships (Irenguȕn & Arikboǧa, <br>2015).  <br>From the discussion above, it can be noted that SE is essential for society and entrepreneurs. Of great <br>impo rtance is the fact that any person can benefit from SE, particularly those who were previously excluded. <br>Notably, in a South African context, previously excluded persons means those who were oppressed. As a <br>result of oppression, they did not have access to  resources and skills and as such, they need to be a dvanced. <br>One can assist in this endeavour in one’s neighbourhood, city or country. The benefits associated with social <br>entrepreneurship are discussed below.  <br>21.3.1.1 Benefits for society  <br>It is notable tha t there is a dire need for more skills and developme nt in the following areas:  <br>• Sustainable environmental development  <br>• Poverty reduction  <br>• Education  369 <br> • Medical and health care  <br>• Social deprivation and isolation  <br>• Sanitation  <br>• Infrastructure development  <br>The above elements are critical for the advancement of society, taki ng into account the restricted access to <br>opportunities. The above elements  are mostly applicable to the communities that were previously <br>disadvantaged.  <br>21.3.1.2 Benefits for the entrepreneur  <br>SE has the ability to provide people with the option to become th eir own bosses and work for something that <br>they have a passion for and believe in. This essentially enables the fulfilment of personal and professional <br>goals. Wh en people have a passion and believe in the business initiative, the business has a greater pos sibility <br>of succeeding.  <br>21.3.2 Social entrepreneurs and forprofit entrepreneurs (traditional entrepreneurs)  <br>Some studies have shown that entrepreneurial and soci al personalities are incompatible. In this instance, <br>traditional entrepreneurs/for -profit entre preneurs exhibit high levels of self -interest and display low levels of <br>social conscience, which is in contrast to the attributes of social entrepreneurs (Smith,  Bell & Watts, 2014).  <br>It is further posited that successful social entrepreneurs possess the sa me entrepreneurial attributes as for -<br>profit entrepreneurs. These include among others, innovativeness, risk taking, propensity to start new ventures, <br>need for ac hievement and need for independence.  <br>21.3.2.1 Social entrepreneur  <br>Social entrepreneurs may be d escribed as persons who drive social innovation and transformation in various <br>areas of interest, which include education, health, environment and enterprise deve lopment. They ordinarily <br>pursue poverty -alleviation goals with entrepreneurial zeal, use busine ss methods and have the courage to <br>innovate and overcome traditional practices. Ashoka (2013) defines social entrepreneurs as individuals “with <br>innovative soluti ons to society’s most pressing social problems who find what is not working and solve the <br>probl em by changing the system, spreading the solutions and persuading the entire society to move in a <br>different direction”. This type of entrepreneurship dealing wit h societal issues that relate to education, health <br>and social justice has increased proportiona lly to the increased need created by a global financial crisis. A <br>social entrepreneur, similar to a traditional entrepreneur, builds strong and sustainable organ isations, but these <br>are either set up as not -for-profit or for -profit entities. Social entrepre neurs are seen by scholars to be more <br>creative compared to traditional entrepreneurs and this is attributed to the limited funding and resources that <br>they have a ccess to. In this regard, they tend to work more cautiously since they rely mostly on donor fun ding <br>as compared to the donations or allocations from government sources.  <br>Social entrepreneurs act as change agents for society, seizing opportunities others mis s and improving <br>systems, inventing new approaches, and creating solutions to change society for  the better. This type of <br>entrepreneur has the following attributes, as identified by Shwab (2013), which distinguish them from other <br>entrepreneurs in that they  <br>• achieve large -scale, systemic and sustainable social change through a new invention and a diffe rent <br>approach  <br>• focus on the social and/or ecological value creation and try to optimise the financial value creation  <br>• focus on innovation by finding a new product,  a new service, or a new approach to a social problem  <br>• drive passion to make things happen  <br>• belie ve in the innate capacity of all people to contribute meaningfully to economic and social development  <br>• do not sit back and wait for change to happen, hence they are regarded as change agents.  370 <br> 21.3.2.2 For -profit entrepreneurs (traditional entrepreneurs)  <br>This type of entrepreneur is profit driven. They focus on this since their primary reason for existence i s <br>profitability and sustaining their existence.  <br>21.4 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SOCIAL AND TRADITIONAL ENTREPRENEURS  <br>There are differences that exist between the  two types of entrepreneurs. These include the following:  <br>• Profit maximisation:  this is common for all  traditional entrepreneurs who pursue businesses to make a <br>profit; this is their reason for existence.  <br>• Social values:  understandably social values have lit tle to do with profits, however, social entrepreneurs are <br>involved in the fulfilment of basic and sus tainable needs characterised by the provision of food, education <br>and medical services to the needy in society.  <br>Table 21.1 Difference between social and tra ditional entrepreneurs  <br>Social entrepreneurs  Traditional entrepreneurs  <br>• In addition to individual talent, strength lies in the <br>organisation’s collective wisdom and experience  • Strength is in individual talent, skills, energy <br>and knowledge  <br>• Focus is on buildi ng long -term capacity of the <br>organisation  • Focus is on short -term financ ial gain  <br>• Ideas and ventures are related to the organisation’s <br>social mission  • There is no limit on type or scope of ideas and <br>ventures  <br>• Profit is a means to achieve the end objective, w hich <br>is a specific social mission  • Profit is the end objective  <br>• Profit is ploughed back into the organisation to further <br>the social mission  • Profit is pocketed and/or distributed to the <br>shareholders  <br>• Risk organisation’s assets and image  • Risk personal and/or investor assets  <br>• Enable the non -profit organisation to become <br>sustainable, and therefore in charge of its own <br>destiny  • They are in charge of own destiny rather than <br>being under obligation to an employer  <br>Source:  National Centre for Social Entrepreneurs (200 1) <br>21.5 THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP  <br>Based on the nature of social entrepreneurship, it is notable that it is beneficial to society as social innovation <br>that will in all likelihood bring benefits to a number of interest groups in the following  manner:  <br>• For business:  increase in turnover and pr ofits; volume of clients increases; loyalty and satisfaction; positive <br>image of the business  <br>• Social target groups:  the social groups might benefit in terms of a reduction of high unemployment rates <br>and the alleviation of poverty within society. Finally, th e social upliftment is fundamental if the reality of <br>social entrepreneurship is to be achieved  371 <br> • The state:  a greater attempt is made by the state to reduce pollution and increase favourable public opinion <br>towards the state. This is beneficial to the state a s it assists state in addressing unemployment in the <br>communities.  <br>• Social enterprises:  these are imperative for the development of innovative ways of providing services and <br>goods. These also provide services  associated with the provision of services that address the social <br>challenges among the communities, for instance, issues such as health , drug abuse illiteracy and crime. <br>Social enterprises play an important role in ensuring that communities are assisting with these mentioned <br>issues to ensure that they improve the situation.  <br>• Promotion of equity:  social entrepreneurship is seen as an interv ention attempting to foster equity among <br>society. This intervention stems from the disparities of the past and as such t hose who were marginalised <br>in terms of services need to be prioritised in terms of social upliftment initiatives. This is done to improv e <br>their livelihoods and ensure sustainability.  <br>21.5.1 Social entrepreneurship in the South African context  <br>In recent yea rs, SE in South Africa has become very topical and highly recognised by government, donors and <br>the public as a vehicle for the developme nt of solutions to social issues (Karanda & Toledano, 2012). These <br>issues include among others, insecurity, unemployment , food shortages and environmental degradation, which <br>have all been major problems among the community.  <br>Urban (2008) believes that the c ommercial sector, corporate governance and social responsibility have <br>essentially gained prominence in the  modern corpor ation. The importance of social entrepreneurs contributes <br>to an economy by way of providing an alternative business model for firms to t rade commercially in a socially <br>sustainable way (Urban, 2008). It is notable that social entrepreneurs provide solutions  to aspects such as <br>health, education, housing and community support of some kind. All these aspects they plague communities <br>and therefo re, there is a dire need to come up with social solutions to ensure that communities are supported <br>with regard to the il ls that they encounter in their daily lives.  <br>In South Africa, it has emerged that traditional government initiatives are not able to ful fil the social deficit, <br>where a quest to reduce dependency on social -welfare hand -outs such as grants is being implement ed. This <br>type of dependency emanated from a social context characterised by the inequalities of the past, especially <br>where they relate t o such issues as education, housing, high unemployment rates and poverty rates in <br>communities.  <br>21.5.2 Driving forces of social entrepreneurship relevant to South Africa  <br>The main drivers for SE as identified by Austin, Stevenson and Wei -Skillern (2006) incl ude, among others, <br>the following:  <br>• Economic:  the reduction of funding from the government  <br>• Social:  problems of increasing complexity and magnitude  <br>• Political:  the devolution of social functions from national to local level and from public to private  <br>21.5.3 Th e social enterprise and resources  <br>One of the underlying principles of SE is its contribution towards social benefits as compared to yielding <br>profitability for the business. The critical distinction between it and traditional entrepreneurship is the creatio n <br>of social value and its sustainability. This, however, gives a clear differentiation from traditional entrepreneurs <br>as its focus is more of a social nature than profit oriented. In another context, particularly in developed <br>countries, a focus is on socia l enterprise that has a specific emphasis on the environment, and cultural and <br>ethical areas for people who run the risk  of social exclusion. This primarily includes women, people with <br>disabilities as well as poor people from other countries (Karanda & Tol edano, 2012). This context is somehow <br>different from the South African perspectives, in the sense that social entreprene urship is more inclusive with <br>the main aim of creating social value for all who qualify for these benefits. Let us consider what has hap pened <br>with other African countries: Zambia, with its wealth in copper reserves; Nigeria with its oil resources; and 372 <br> Zimb abwe known for its diamond and uranium deposits. Despite their wealth, these countries failed to live up <br>to expectations in terms of SE.  They have essentially failed to support SE due to economic variables, such as <br>exchange rates and other related factors,  which hamper the disposable income of these countries. This situation <br>is also applicable to South Africa, as economic challenges serve as an obstacle to sustain social entrepreneurial <br>endeavours.  <br>21.6 VISION FOR SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP  <br>The vision of SE is  to address neglected problems within society. This concept is about applying practical, <br>innovative and sustainable approaches to benefit society in general, with an emphasis on those who are <br>marginalised and poor. In this regard, social  entrepreneurs deve lop new methodologies and innovative <br>solutions taking into account the lack of resources and the type of problems they intend addressing. According <br>to Sekliuckiene and Kisielius (2015), the process of SE initiative development embraces s everal stages, <br>name ly context, processes and results. Taking into account the context, it is important to explore the <br>environment and conditions that essentially provide opportunities to address social problems through SE <br>initiatives. In this regard, the r ole of social entre preneurs becomes imperative, since they have a significant <br>impact on the communities in which they operate.  <br>21.7 SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP CASE STUDY  <br>CASE STUDY ON AMBITION:  Muhammad Yunus  <br>The website  http://b obbyudoh.com  (2015) quotes from Bill Halamandaris’s book  The heart of America: ten core values that <br>make our country great , in which he lists 10 core values that built America. The 10 values with proven ability to build a world <br>superpo wer are as follows:  <br>1. Compassion  <br>2. Opportunity  <br>3. Responsibility  <br>4. Equality  <br>5. Valour  <br>6. Ambition  <br>7. Liberty  <br>8. Unity  <br>9. Enterprise  <br>10. Spirituality  <br>In this case study of the value of ambition, we look at an individual who provides an excellent example of what it means and <br>what it do es for a nation. His  name is Muhammad Yunus.  <br>Background  <br>Muhammad Yunus, known as the “Banker to the Poor”, was born on 28 June, 1940 in Chittagong in the south -eastern region <br>of Bangladesh. His education started in his village primary school and continued at Lamabazar Primary  School and Chittagong <br>Collegiate Sc hool, after which he studied at Chittagong College. In 1957, he entered Dhaka University where he got his first <br>degree in 1960 and Master’s in 1961, both in economics. In 1969, he obtained his PhD in the same discipline from the <br>Vanderbilt University in th e US.  <br>Yunus began working as a lecturer at the Chittagong College and went on to lecture at the Middle Tennessee State University <br>in the US. After the liberation war of Bangladesh, Yunus returned home in 1972 and worked briefly for the government planning <br>commission. Later he returned to the teaching profession where he became the head of the Economics Department at the <br>Chittagong University. By 1975, Yunus was a professor of economics at the same university.  373 <br> Yunus’s ambi tion – poverty alleviation  <br>Yunus’ re action to the devastating famine that hit Bangladesh in 1974 was to produce programmes that, many years <br>afterwards, have improved the quality of life of the people, many of whom would probably not be alive today but for these <br>interventions. According to Yu nus, poverty in Bangladesh decreased by one per cent per year till 2000 and by two per cent <br>from then until 2005 (statistics beyond 2005 are not yet available). He believes that where this rate is sustained, the pover ty <br>level could decrease by 50 per cent by 2015 and possibly be eradicated by 2030.  <br>We cannot fault his enthusiasm, especially when you consider that Bangladesh is one of the poorest countries in the world <br>and any reversal of the poverty trend is crucial, part icularly in an era where rich nation s are seeing an increase in their poverty <br>level.  <br>Let us look at how he pursued his ambition to eliminate poverty:  <br>Microcredit schemes:  he started by providing loans from his own pocket to women who produced bamboo furnit ure and with <br>the success of this sch eme on a small scale, he persuaded the government -owned Janata Bank to provide the microcredit <br>schemes. With the support of Janata Bank, Yunus was able to significantly increase the number of beneficiaries of microcredit . <br>By 1982, the scheme had over 28 00 0 members. This success led to him establishing Grameen Bank in 1983.  <br>It is important to note that beneficiaries of this scheme were people with no money, no collateral, the poorest of the societ y <br>with no evidence of the ir ability to pay back the loans. Bu t Yunus believed that these impoverished people had skills and <br>abilities that were underutilised and only the availability of funds would result in the expression of such skills and abilit ies and <br>improve their standard o f living.  <br>Since the inception of the  microcredit scheme, over R107 billion ($8 billion) in microcredit has been made available. Today, it <br>makes a difference in the lives of nearly 8 million of its beneficiaries, and over 40 million when you include family members. <br>Millions more in other coun tries (including developed nations) have been positively affected where the model has been <br>replicated. The microcredit scheme from Grameen Bank affects the lives of nearly a third of the Bangladesh population, direct ly <br>or indirectly, becoming one of the ke y vehicles for building that nation.  <br>Women empowerment:  Yunus is a firm believer that women are the most critical tool for poverty alleviation when empowered, <br>especially since he believes women are better money managers,  are more responsible and also more accountable when given <br>loans. They are also more industrious.  <br>He therefore set out to make women the core target of his microcredit schemes. Today, about 94 per cent of the Grameen <br>Bank schemes’ beneficiaries are women, with an almost 99 per cent loan repa yment rate despite most of them joining the <br>scheme when they were beggars, destitute, illiterate, divorcees and widows, etc.  <br>This economic empowerment gave the women income to educate their children, expand their trade, open savings accounts <br>for their chil dren’s training and future security, and feed the family (including their husbands). In addition, these women now <br>have a sense of worth to create communities where they support one another to utilise their skills and abi lities. Many of these <br>women have imp roved the standard of living of their families and there are studies that indicate that the success these women <br>achieve has led to respect from their husbands, respect from men generally, and reduced divorce and birth ra tes in the <br>community. This illustrat es the multiple effects of women empowerment as a means for poverty alleviation.  <br>Social business enterprise:  Yunus saw the poor as bankable, which is a radical change from a normal banking approach. <br>He viewed banking as a social business and as a result in  1983, Grameen Bank became a fully -fledged bank, providing loans <br>to poor Bangladeshis with no collateral. His bank model operates with corporate efficiency and focuses on social efforts by <br>pumping profits back into its s ocial objectives.  <br>Today, Grameen Ban k has over 2 500 branches in Bangladesh covering three -quarters of the rural areas of the country. <br>Independent studies by the World Bank and others indicate that within five years, about half of Grameen’s borrowers manag e <br>to pull themselves out of poverty,  while a further quarter hover near the poverty line.  <br>To expand the vision to alleviate poverty, the Grameen Group is involved in several profit and non -profit social business <br>ventures, which include: Grameen Danone (a p artnership with Danone established t o address the problem of the malnutrition <br>of millions of children in Bangladesh); Grameen Veolia (a partnership with Veolia Water to address water problems); BASF <br>Grameen (a partnership with BASF to produce chemically tr eated mosquito nets to curb malaria) ; Grameen Intel (to bring <br>affordable information technology solutions to rural villages); Grameen America (to help poor American women come out of <br>poverty through microcredit schemes) and many other initiatives.  <br>What can  we learn about ambition from the li fe of this great man?  374 <br> Ambition expressed in his compassion and responsibility:  moved with compassion by the plight of the poor in Bangladesh <br>and across the globe, Yunus accepted responsibility to do something to address the problem. He does not deny the ro le of <br>government but his ambition is big enough to help millions of people com e out of poverty.  <br>Ambition -inspired enterprise:  Yunus’s ambition gave birth to various innovative approaches that we now call social <br>enterpris e. He later set up the Yunus Centre Social Business Design Lab to help infuse the ambition of many others with the  <br>unique spirit of enterprise.  <br>Ambition creates total commitment:  since 1974 when a serious famine in Bangladesh compelled him to act, Yunus ha s <br>been totally committed to the visi on of alleviating poverty. This has earned him numerous awards globally, inclu ding the 2006 <br>Nobel Peace Prize,  which he won jointly with Grameen Bank. As expected, he used his share of the $1.4 million award money <br>to cre ate a company to make low -cost, high -nutrition food and also to set up an eye hospital for the poor.  <br>Ambition led to national transformation:  through one man’s ambition, nations across the globe are witnessing national <br>transformation. Today, more than 250 institutions in nearly 100 countries  operate microcredit programmes and social -business <br>initiatives based on the G rameen Group model, while thousands of other microcredit programmes have emulated, adapted or <br>been inspired by the Grameen Group. According to  an expert on innovative government,  the programmes established by <br>Yunus at the Grameen Bank are “the single most important development in the third world in the last 100 years, and I don’t <br>think any two people will disagree.”  <br>Summary  <br>Udo doesn’t believe M uhammad Yunus would have had such an  ambition and global impact if he wasn’t confronted with the <br>poverty crisis in  Bangladesh. This means that great ambitions are birthed at a place of great crisis.  <br>With Nigeria being in a deep crisis, the question for you  is, “What ambition do you have for Nigeria?”  <br>Source:  http://bobbyudoh.com/case -study -on-ambition -muhammad -yunis  <br>Questions  <br>1.

The importance  of pursuing social <br>entrepreneurship in any context was investigated. The  practice of social entrepreneurship has some benefits <br>and these entail: (i) sustainable environmental development; (ii) poverty reduction; (iii) education; (iv) <br>medical and health ca re; (v) reduction of social deprivation and isolation; (vi) the developme nt of sanitation; <br>and (vi) infrastructure  development. All these factors are imperative for the benefits of community upliftment <br>and people’s livelihoods. It is notable that societies  are constantly changing and the approach towards <br>supporting these commun ities needs a paradigm shift. It becomes imperative for social entrepreneurs to be <br>cognisant of what the needs of the community are before any attempt can be made to provide support.  <br> <br>REVIEW QUESTIONS  <br>21.1 In your own understanding define social entreprene urship.  <br>21.2 What are the benefits of social entrepreneurship to society?  375 <br> 21.3 What are the differences between a social entrepreneur and traditional entrepreneur?  <br>21.4 What is the im portance of social entrepreneurship?  <br>21.5 Name any three driving forces of social entrepreneurship.  <br>REFERENCES  <br>Ashoka. 2013.

It is a wr itten document that details the proposed venture and highlights the <br>purpose, disti nct advantage and money -making characteristics of the opportunity.  <br>The business plan is usually formulated following the evaluation of an opportunity or feasibility (strong <br>market, attractive industry and the right team) study. It is a document that descri bes: the opportunity; team <br>talents; product/service; context; strategy; required resources; financial return; and the risks of a venture. The <br>business plan can be seen as an alignment tool for a new business venture. In the business plan, different <br>compone nts are brought together into a coherent document. It is vital that an entrepreneur is able to explain <br>what has been included in the business plan as well as why it has been included.  <br>The specific objectives of the business are detailed in the business pla n. The market in which the business will <br>operate is described and quantified. The competition is analysed, and strategies and action plans are <br>formulated. The various require d resources are highlighted and detailed financial statements such as the: cash <br>flow statement, income statement and balance sheet are provided. The importance of a carefully considered, <br>well-constructed business plan cannot be overemphasised.  379 <br> 22.2 BENEFIT S OF WRITING A BUSINESS PLAN  <br>It is important for the entrepreneur or the entrepren eurial team to be involved in drawing up a  business plan. <br>This allows the planning team to consider every aspect of the business. It is always wise to seek assistance <br>from bu siness consultants, but entrepreneurs need to be the driving force behind the plan ning process as it is <br>their business. Therefore, the business plan needs to express the vision of the entrepreneur. The benefits of <br>writing a business plan are as follows:  <br>1. See the whole business:  the business plans connects all the functions of the busines s. The entrepreneur <br>has to ensure that all the functions of the business “speak” to one another. Are long -term costs, product <br>development and working capital catered for in t he plan?  <br>2. Strategic alignment:  do daily business activities correspond with the vis ion and strategy? If so, the <br>business is strategically aligned. If not, the business planning will bring up the hidden discrepancies.  <br>3. Business objectives will be clear:  the e ntrepreneur has to use the business plan to define and measure <br>objectives (sales, market share, product launches, etc.).  <br>4. Priorities will make sense:  use the plan for growth, management and financial health. These factors <br>must be reviewed as the business pr ogresses.  <br>5. Develop accountability:  good planning process sets expectations and trac ks results. Good work shows <br>up. Disappointments show up too. A well -run monthly plan review with plan vs. actual included <br>becomes an impromptu review of tasks and accomplishm ents.  <br>6. Manage cash:  good business planning helps the entrepreneur manage cash flow.  When the business <br>involves credit sales, physical products, purchasing assets, or repaying debts, cash flow takes planning <br>and management. Lucrative businesses suffer when s low-paying clients or too much inventory block <br>cash flow. A plan helps you see the  problem and adjust to it.  <br>7. Milestones:  good business planning sets milestones the business wishes to achieve. These are key goals <br>you want to achieve, like reaching a defined sales level, hiring a specific sales manager, or opening the <br>new location. A busi ness plan helps develop and achieve the se goals.  <br>8. Metrics:  put your performance indicators and numbers to track into a business plan where you can see <br>them monthly in the plan -review meeting. Figure out the numbers that matter. Sales and expenses <br>usually do , but there are also calls, trips, semi nars, web traffic, conversion rates, returns, and so forth. <br>Use your business planning to define and track the key metrics.  <br>9. Realistic regular reminders to keep on track:  the business -planning process becomes a regular  <br>reminder to maintain quality and strat egic focus. It is hard, during the heat of everyday routine, to <br>remember the priorities and focus.  <br>10. Delegation is key:  the business plan is an ideal place to clarify who is responsible for what task. The <br>business plan helps the entrepreneur keep track of ro les and responsibilities.  <br>Now that the benefits of writing a business plan have been explained, entrepreneurs must determine their <br>business’s needs in order to draw up a suitable one.  Section 22.3  presents the different objectives when <br>drawing up a business plan.  <br>22.3 OBJECTIVES WHEN DEVELOPING A BUS INESS PLAN  <br>There are three primary obje ctives for compiling a business plan, as described by Nieman and Nieuwenhuizen <br>(2014: 121).  <br>22.3.1 To obtain funding  <br>Any business needs capital. The business plan can be considered a vital sales tool for approaching a nd <br>capturing financial sources, be they investors or lenders. Any investor or lender wants to know that the <br>business it is lending money to, or is investing  money in, has planned carefully.  380 <br> Given the limited resources most entrepreneurs have at their dispo sal in the start -up stage, few can afford to <br>waste these resources. Without a business plan, the entrepreneur could easily waste certain resources without <br>even realising it and when it is already too late. For existing and even large businesses, stakeholde rs such as <br>shareholders, investors and creditors demand  a high return on their capital. This will require optimal utilisation <br>of capital and the other facto rs of production. Without the assistance or guidance of a business plan, this is <br>most unlikely.  <br>22.3.2 To serve an internal purpose  <br>The business plan has the potential to provide the businessperson with the following:  <br>• A focus: a coordinated effort towards  a clearly defined objective  <br>• An objective: everybody will know where he or she is heading or what he or she is working towards  <br>• A tool for measuring performance against: to know whether performance is satisfactory, unsatisfactory or <br>outstanding  <br>• A marketing tool for obtaining finance or selling the business: outsiders will form a clear picture of what the <br>business is doing or hoping to achieve  <br>• A road map to direct the business  <br>• A systematic evaluation of the chances of success in the market  <br>• A method for determ ining the risks facing the business, product or idea  <br>22.3.3 To be used as a tool for reducing risk  <br>The business plan helps the prospective entrepreneur to reduce the risk in starting the new venture. The process <br>of drawing up the business plan forces the e ntrepreneur to think carefully and to consider each aspect of the <br>new business venture. In doing so, the entrepreneur quite often has to consider alternatives and new directions. <br>It also helps the businessperson to focus all his or her efforts on achieving  a specific objective. The business <br>plan serves as a yardstick for comparing actual and budgeted resu lts in order to provide feedback on the <br>success rate or failure rate of the business activities and effort.  <br>It is important that the business plan be regar ded as a tool that can assist the businessperson to clarify and <br>direct the activities in the business . The business plan should be seen as something businesspeople are doing <br>for themselves and not for outsiders.  <br>22.4 TYPES OF BUSINESS PLANS  <br>Many entrepreneurs believe that business plans are just for start -up businesses that require funding. This notion <br>has kept several businesses from the benefits highlighted above. There are various types of business plans, <br>whether starting a business or cha nging its mode. When developing a business plan, the entrepreneur will need <br>to carefully consider the objective of t he business plan. Once the objective is clear, the most appropriate type <br>of plan should be used.  <br>The most common types are the following:  <br>• Business plan to obtain a loan  <br>• Business plan to secure investors  <br>• Business plan for manufacturing ventures  <br>• Business pla n for service ventures  <br>• Business plan for high -technology ventures  <br>• Business plan for retail ventures  <br>These business plan types will be discus sed below.  381 <br> 22.4.1 Business plan to obtain a loan  <br>Ideally the business plan that is designed to obtain a loan should not differ greatly from a business plan that is <br>used as a strategic document. In practice, however, financial institutions are very conserva tive in their <br>evaluations of loan applications and have to be convinced that the business will be able to meet the r epayment <br>requirements timeously.  <br>Important aspects of the business plan that financial institutions will carefully consider prior to grantin g loans <br>include the following:  <br>• Evidence of the customers’ acceptance of the venture’s product or service (proof of s cientific market <br>research and “realistic” findings and forecasts are needed)  <br>• An appreciation of the policy of banks with regard to risk and collateral  <br>• Evidence of focus and concentration on only a limited number of products and/or services  <br>• Realistic financ ial projections  <br>• Realistic growth projections  <br>• Avoidance of infatuation with the product or service, rather a familiarity with real marketplac e needs  <br>• Identification and consideration of potential risks  <br>• Avoidance of exaggeration of own and management’s creden tials and abilities  <br>22.4.2 Business plan for investors  <br>Investors usually look for a healthy ROI (return on investment) and rapid growth as they expect to share in <br>the rewards. The business plan should therefore include the following:  <br>• Funds needed over the short term  <br>• Funds needed in two to five years  <br>• How funds will be deployed  <br>• How funds fuel growth  <br>• The estimated ROI: calculate the best -case scenario and worst -case scenario  <br>• The percentage of ownership/equity that you will give up to investors  <br>• Financial report ing <br>• A description of whether investors will be on the b oard or in management  <br>• An exit strategy for investors  <br>22.4.3 Business plan for a manufacturing venture  <br>Manufacturing is mostly capital intensive and requires key inputs from suppliers. This plan needs t o focus <br>more on operational abilities and should theref ore include the following:  <br>• The planned production level and capacity  <br>• The production or capacity limits of planned physical plant and equipment  <br>• Purchasing and inventory management procedures and costing  <br>• The anticipated level of direct production cost and in direct costs  <br>• Research and development activities and costs  <br>22.4.4 Business plan for service venture  <br>Services businesses offer intangible products and are therefore flexible and have high labour costs a nd <br>generally very little in fixed assets. This business  plan should therefore include:  <br>• Services costing and prices in relation to competitors  <br>• Quality control procedures  <br>• Customer loyalty and relationship management programmes  <br>• Ways of managing customer expec tations and satisfaction  382 <br> 22.4.5 Business plan for high -technology ventures  <br>Businesses in high technology operate in rapidly changing and shorter life -cycle environments. These <br>businesses sometimes have to operate for long ti mes without profits. Because of the pressure in these <br>businesses, the plans should include the following:  <br>• Strategies on cutting -edge products and services offerings  <br>• Advanced research and development plans  <br>• Innovation strategies  <br>• Information system to manage rapidly changing prices, costs a nd market forces  <br>• Innovative practices and firm -wide entrepreneurial behaviours  <br>• How the firm will protect intellectual property  <br>• How the firm will avoid technological obsolescence  <br>22.4.6 Business plan for retail ventures  <br>Norma lly retailing is determined by t he location of the venture and convenience of the location. Important <br>aspects in this business are things like quality of the brand, the physical environment and service in the store <br>that include its image and perceived cust omer value. The plan should incl ude the following:  <br>• Location and distribution strategy  <br>• Trading space and access to resources  <br>• Pricing and mark -up policies  <br>• Store convenience, accessibility and other central facilities  <br>• Store image and branding  <br>• Customer service  policies  <br>• Inventory management  <br>22.5 GUIDANCE ON WRITING A BUSINESS PLAN  <br>A good business plan depends on the strength of the businesses product offering. The business plan is not the <br>business; therefore, it cannot save a bad business idea. Similarly, a good business concept can be present ed <br>poorly. Below are guidelines for ensu ring a successful business -planning process.  <br>• Keep the plan short:  the business plan should be 20−25 pages long. The entrepreneur has to explain the <br>vision of the venture in a concise manner. If the plan is short, it can easily be easily refined over time.  <br>• Know your audience:  write the business plan in a language your audience understands. For example, if your <br>company is developing complex scientific products, and the investors are not familiar with scientific <br>terms, t hen you need to adapt.  <br>• Identify critical  risks:  you need to show that you have taken into account critical risks to your business. This <br>illustrates that the entrepreneur possesses the ability to analyse problems and provide appropriate <br>solutions.  <br>• Pay atten tion to detail:  presentation is key, use  good grammar, visual aids such as graphs and describe the <br>product in lay terms.  <br>• Maintain confidentiality:  the business plan has to be kept confidential, number every copy and require all <br>recipients to sign a non -disclosure agreement. While confidentiality  is important, the entrepreneur should <br>not become fixated on someone stealing his or her idea. Success of the business is in the execution of the <br>plan.  <br>• Do not be intimidated:  writing a business plan may seem intimida ting, but it does not have to be. If the  <br>entrepreneur know the business and is passionate, writing the plan will not be as difficult as one may <br>think.  383 <br> If entrepreneurs ignore these guidelines, they may not acquire the required resources. It is suggested th at <br>entrepreneurs enlist the assistance o f business consultants to write or critique the plan.  <br>22.6 LIMITATIONS IN BUSINESS PLANNING  <br>When entrepreneurs are drawing up a business plan, it is important for them to be aware of possible problems. <br>In this way, t hey can avoid any pitfalls that may resu lt in errors in the business plan and ultimately in the <br>objectives of the business plan not being achieved.  <br>Table 22.1 Common problems associated with business plans and how to avoid them  <br>1. Lack of proven market <br>demand  • Do thorough, scientifically based mark et research to support <br>claims  <br>2. Lack of objectivity  • Let an independent consultant critically assess the business plan  <br>• Base projections on research  <br>• Be conservative with projections  <br>• Try to look at the business plan from the point of view of a <br>potential investor  <br>3. Ignoring competition  • Make a list of all existing and potential competitors  <br>• Conduct a SWOT analysis of each competitor  <br>• Determine the competitive advantage  <br>• Consider both direct and indirect competition  <br>• Consider the possibility of introducing substitutes for the product <br>or service  <br>• Determine the chances of success should competition be <br>considered  <br>4. Inappropriate market research  • Define the problem to be researched  <br>• Define the target market  <br>• Select a representative sample o f the target market  <br>• Collect the data  <br>• Analyse and interpret the dat a <br>• Draw conclusions  <br>• Make projections  <br>5.

Investors often feel comfortable when they <br>see a business plan in a format that is familiar to them. Although it may be a mistake t o deviate significantly <br>from the standard format, it is important to remember that a business plan needs to be adapted to meet specific <br>purposes. The entrepre neur cannot adopt a one -size-fits-all approach when developing a business plan and <br>should adapt an d customise the business plan as required. With that said, the entrepreneur should keep in mind <br>the opportunity identified in the feasibility study. Once this  is done, the management strategies will follow <br>suit. The written business plan needs to take into  account the following success factors:  <br>• The opportunity:  the plan needs to emulate the potential and attractiveness of both the market and <br>industry.  <br>• Critical resources:  these are in the form of money, human assets (lawyers, suppliers, etc.) and hard assets  <br>(inventories, accounts receivables, etc.) need to be minimised to keep start -up costs low.  <br>• The entrepreneurial team:  needs to possess the necessary experience and integrity to conduct business in <br>an ethical manner.  <br>• The financial structure:  the financing o f the business (i.e. debt versus equity) and share ownership need to <br>be considered. This structure will greatly affect  the entrepreneur’s commitment in the business.  <br>• The context:  the impact of external factors (environment, interest rates, inflation, demog raphic changes, <br>etc.) on the business opportunity.  <br>Therefore, the business plan will need to demonstrate that the entr epreneur has appropriately integrated these <br>factors in his or her planning. Undoubtedly, uncertainties and ambiguities exist, however the entrepreneur <br>needs to devise solutions to deal with these issues. Although there is no single format for a business pl an, the <br>investors need to see a plan that is familiar to them.  Table 22.2  outlines a standard business plan format.  <br>Table 22.2 The outline of a business plan  <br>Cover sheet  <br>• Full name of business  <br>• Phone and email  <br>• Full s treet address  • Contact name and title  <br>• Postal address  <br>• Date of plan  <br>Table of contents  <br>• Lists main headings  <br>• Includes graphs, charts and tables  <br>Summary/executive abstract  <br>Highlights important aspects of the plan  <br>Business and product or service description  <br>• The business  <br>• The products or service  <br>• The industry  <br>Marketing plan  <br>• Outline the 4 Ps (product, price, promotion and place)  386 <br> • Competitive advantage  <br>• Customers, market size, competition and market evaluation  <br>Operations plan  <br>• Focus on facilities, manufacturi ng, capability and equipment  <br>• The steps and time taken to bring the business up to full speed  <br>Management plan/the team  <br>The management team. List all directors, consultants, advisers and key professionals who will be involved in the <br>business. Attach detai led CVs as appendices.  <br>Sustainability plan  <br>This should address the social, economic and environmental sustainability of the business:  <br>• Environmental issues  <br>• Nature of opportunities for green impact  <br>• Employment opportunities  <br>• Potential environmental impac t <br>Financial plan/critical risks  <br>• Start -up capital  <br>• Projected income  <br>• Projected balance sheet  <br>• Projected cash flow statement  <br>• Projected capital equipment  <br>• Critical risks involved in the business  <br>Appendices  <br>All pieces of evidence, such as CVs, product bro chures, testimonials and news articles  <br> <br>The components outlined in  Table 22.2  are discussed in more detail below.  <br>22.7.1 Cover sheet  <br>The cover sheet should contain the following information about the business:  <br>• The full name of the business  <br>• Ownership status  <br>• Full street address  <br>• Address if different from the street address  <br>• Phone, ema il and website information  <br>• Contact name and title  <br>• Date of the plan  387 <br> 22.7.2 Table of contents  <br>Lists the main headings and subheadings and provides page numbers. The table of contents allows the reader <br>to spot-read the plan rather than reading it from front t o back.  <br>Remember also to list all charts, tables or graphs in your table of contents.  <br>22.7.3 Summary/executive abstract  <br>The summary or executive abstract briefly sets out the contents of the business p lan. It normally contains key <br>sentences from each secti on of the plan to give an overview of the project in brief. Limit the summary to two <br>or three pages.  <br>Remember, the summary of a business plan should highlight the important features and opportunities, which <br>will allow the reader a quick overview of whether  or not the business described in it is of interest. The summary <br>is normally written after the business plan has been drawn up.  <br>The executive summary should include  <br>• a brief history of the company  <br>• what the business is about  <br>• what its objectives are  <br>• the purpo se of the loan request  <br>• the amount of the loan requested  <br>• how funds will be used  <br>• how the loan will be repaid  <br>• how much of the total required capital the owners are providing  <br>• what collateral can be offered to secure the loan.  <br>22.7.4 Business and product or ser vice description  <br>This section should briefly describe the product or service, to whom it is sold, the current status of the industry <br>and where the new business fits in. Th is will give the reader a chance to establish a basis for detailed <br>understanding.  <br>To succeed, entrepreneurs must know their products or services. To obtain finance, potential investors or <br>lenders should be provided with the following information of the bus iness’s products and services:  <br>• Description of the products or service to be sold:  describe the primary end use, as well as any significant <br>secondary applications. Emphasise any unique features and how the products or services on offer will <br>account for mark et penetration.  <br>• Proprietary position:  describe any patents, trade secrets or other fe atures.  <br>• Potential:  describe any features of the product or service that will give it an advantage over the competition. <br>Discuss opportunities to expand the product line an d how to take advantage of them. Also, discuss any <br>product disadvantage or technologi cal changes or marketing fads, if applicable.  <br>22.7.5 Marketing plan  <br>This is a critical section that should clearly specify the business’s marketing goals, how they are to be achieved <br>and who will have the responsibility for achieving them. Attention should  be paid to the 4 Ps, namely product, <br>price, place and promotion. Make sure to describe these in detail.  <br>This section also focuses on customers, industry and competition:  <br>• Customers:  discuss who the customers of the product or service are. Briefly describe the basis of the <br>purchase decisions, for example price, quality, service, personal contacts or political pressure.  388 <br> • Industry:  describe the size of the current total market for the product or service offered. This market size <br>should be determined from availa ble market data sources. Also discuss potential distributors and dealers.  <br>• Competition:  make a realistic assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of competitive products and <br>services, and name the businesses that supply them. Compare the competing product s and services on <br>the basis of price, performance, service, warranties and other pertinent features.  <br>a) Marketing strategies  <br>• Identify what customer groups your business wi ll target  <br>• Set penetration goals  <br>• Decide on a pricing policy  <br>• Select appropriate packagi ng <br>• Develop a promotion strategy  <br>b) Sales forecast  <br>• Identify the size of your manufacturing operation  <br>• Decide on amount of capital required  <br>Do not make any guesses in this section. Check all facts and note all sources. These will surely be checked. It <br>is also  important to indicate whether the business has a competitive advantage over similar businesses.  <br>22.7.6 Operations plan  <br>This section focuses on facilities, manufacturing capability and equipment. If the business is in manufacturing, <br>it will help to include  floor plans as well as future space plans.  <br>The length of this section will depend on whether it is a service or product business. If the latter, it will depend <br>on how technical the product is. The following aspects need attention:  <br>• Capacity:  includes, amon g other things, how many products can be produced by the business.  <br>• Scheduling of production:  refers to the timing and steps that will be taken to bring the business up to full <br>speed. Graphs and charts can help to show interrelationships between events. It is advisable to show the <br>progress on a month -by-month basis for the first year. Thereafter, showing progress on a quarterly basis <br>is acceptable.  <br>• Quality management:  this concerns what the business will do to ensure quality and control of inventory.  <br>22.7.7 Management plan/the team  <br>The quality of the management team often determines the potential success o f the business. List all directors, <br>consultants, advisers and other key professionals who will be involved in the business. Indicate whether the <br>team has wo rked together in the past. The management plan, therefore, details the organisational structure of <br>the business. Also, present current and proposed salary structures for those on board and for those still to come <br>on board. A good way to organise the manage ment plan section is to break it into various sections, as follows:  <br>• Ownership structure:  this sectio n describes the legal structure of the business and how the shares are <br>distributed. This also explains if the business is a partnership, company or sole pro prietor.  <br>• Internal management team:  describes the main functions of the business, such as marketing, finance, <br>human resources and/or research and development. Furthermore, the entrepreneur has to explain which <br>employees are responsible for the different fun ctions. Along with the description of the management <br>team, the entrepreneur has to attach CVs of eac h member of the management team. An organisations <br>chart, also called an organogram is shown in  Figure 22.1 . <br> <br> <br> <br> 389 <br> Figure 22.1 An organogram example  <br> <br>• External management resources:  external resources such as advisory boards (retired e xecutives and <br>managers with extensive business expertise) and professional services (accountants, lawyers, IT <br>consultants) act as back up for the internal management team. When compiling a business plan,  the <br>entrepreneur  has to include the names of the adv isory board along with their profiles.  <br>• Human resources needs:  this section explains the number of permanent and contract employees the <br>business requires and the cost thereof. Furthermore, the section has  to make provision for the training of <br>employees.  <br>22.7.8 Sustainability plan  <br>As customers and stakeholders increasingly would like to know whether businesses are supporting <br>sustainability issues, it is important to plan for a sustainable and socially respo nsible business from the start. <br>This can provide any business with a competitive advantage, increase productivity, attract key investors and <br>personnel, reduce waste and improve brand image. The following factors have to be included in the <br>sustainability pl an: <br>• Environmental/resources impacts:  describes the im pact that the business has on the environment. An <br>environmental audit would assist map out this section. An environmental audit is a tool used to minimise <br>liability and avoid the compliance costs (costs related to legislation and regulations) associated wi th new <br>projects. Therefore, helping companies to identify opportunities to improve their operating expenses.  <br>• Community impact and engagement:  the impact that the business has on the community and how the  <br>entrepreneur aims to engage the community in decreas ing the impact.  <br>• Risk:  identify any environmental risks to the business.  <br>• Strategies:  explains the strategies the business will employ to minimise risks and environmental impact.  <br>22.7.9 Financial plan/crit ical risks  <br>The financial part of the business plan ha s to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the business has the <br>potential to be operated profitably. This section needs to provide three financial statements, namely, the <br>balance sheet, income statement  and the cash flow statement.  <br>1. Income statement:  this statement summarises the business revenues and expenses. In comparison to <br>the balance sheet, which shows the business’s financial position at a certain point, the income <br>statement shows the business’s pe rformance during the year. Investors want to know the  revenue of <br>the company to judge whether the business will make a profit. Comparing income statements of <br>previous years will show financial management trends.  <br>390 <br> The four forms of income derived from an inc ome statement are as follows:  <br>1.1 Gross income:  this income reflects sales minus goods sold and depreciation. It reflects how resourcefully <br>the business is producing products.  <br>1.2 Operating income:  gross income minus fixed expenses (rent, administrative expenses and development).  <br>1.3 Pre-tax income:  accounts  for expenses such as interest income and interest paid on debt, as well as <br>charges and credits that have nothing to do with the company’s core business operations.  <br>1.4 Net income:  equals pre -tax income minus all income taxes paid on company earnings.  This income <br>indicates the profitability of the business.  <br> <br>Income statement for the year ending 31 December 2017  <br>Revenue  R180 000  <br>Net sales  R10 000  <br>Gains  R190 000  <br>Total revenues    <br>Expenses    <br>Cost of goods sold  R55 000  <br>Selling and administrative expenses  R24 000  <br>Interest expenses  R10 000  <br>Losses  R 8 000  <br>Income tax  R15 000  <br>Total expenses  (R112 000)  <br>Net income  R78 000  <br> <br>2. Balance sheet:  this section highlights the businesses assets and liabilities. This statement  is prepared at the <br>end of the financial yea r, showing the financial position of the business. Preparing this statement allows the business <br>to analyse its financial strengths and implement improvements.  <br>The balance sheet comprises three categories, namely:  <br>2.1 Assets:  business -owned resources that t he business has acquired over the years through transactions. <br>These resources include costs paid in advance that have not yet expired ( advertising, prepaid insurance, <br>prepaid legal fees and rent).  <br>Assets are divided into two subcategories:  <br>2.1.1  Current as sets:  are items that can be converted into cash within a year. These are cash, securities, <br>accounts receivable, inventory and prepaid e xpenses.  391 <br> 2.1.2  Long -term assets:  encompass resources that cannot be easily liquidated. These are land, equipment, <br>buildin gs, intellectual properties and other tangible assets.  <br>2.2 Assets = resources owned by the business, which can be sold or leased to gen erate cash or used to produce <br>value.  <br>2.3 Liabilities:  comprises all the business’s debts. Similar to assets, liabilities comprises current and long -<br>term liabilities.  <br>2.3.1  Current liabilities:  consist of rent, tax, rates, interest payable, salaries, accoun ts payable, accrued <br>payroll taxes and any long -term debts due in 12 months.  <br>2.3.2  Long -term liabilities:  debts that must be repaid over a period of more than 12 months such as pension <br>and credit from financing institutions.  <br>Liabilities = Money that is owed to creditors  <br>Assets – Liabilities = Equity  <br> <br>2.4 Equity:  at times referred to as the book value of the bu siness, since t he business owners’ equity is equal <br>to the reported asset amount with the reported liability amounts subtracted. This portion of the balance <br>sheet includes retained earnings, company shares, accumulated comprehensive income, common stock <br>and paid-in capita l from treasury stock.  <br> <br>Balance sheet as at 31 December 2017  <br>Assets    <br>Cash  R50 000  <br>Accounts receivable  R20 000  <br>Property, plant and equipment  R50 000  <br>Other assets  R10 000  <br>Total assets  R130 000  <br>    <br>Liabilities    <br>Accounts payable  R15 000  <br>Long -term bo nds payable  R55 000  <br>Total liabilities  R70 000  <br>Equity    <br>Common stock  R29 000  <br>Retained earnings  R31 000  <br>    392 <br> Total liabilities and equity  R130 000  <br> <br>3. Statement of retained earnings:  this statement is also referred to as the statement of changes in equity , <br>which reflects the changes in the company’s retained earnings over the reporting period. Items included in the <br>statement of retained earnings are operations profits or losses, divide nds paid, shares issued or redeemed during <br>the period, and items charged  or credited to retained earnings.  <br> <br>Statement of retained earnings for the year ending 31 December 2017  <br>Retained earnings at 1 January 2017  R53 000  <br>Plus: Net income  R78 000  <br>Less: Dividends  R100 000  <br>Retained earnings at 31 December 2017  R31 000  <br> <br>4. Cash f low statement:  the cash flow statement shows money expected to come in and out of the <br>business at a given time. This statement predicts sales forecasts, cash receipts vs. credi t receipts. How <br>will these expenses be paid and over what period? Will the busin ess make use of credit? This statement <br>gives investors an idea of how business finances are managed.  <br> <br>Cash flow statement for the year ending 31 December 2017  <br>Profit before taxation  R93 000    <br>Add: Non cash flow adjustments  R10 000    <br>Add: Increase or dec rease in working capital  R10 000    <br>Net cash from operating activities    R113 000  <br>Net cash used in investing activities    (R13 000)  <br>Net cash used in financing activities    (R50 000)  <br>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents    R50 000  <br>Cash and cash equi valents at January      <br>Cash and cash equivalent at 31 December 2017    R50 000  <br> <br>Financial statements should indicate a short - and long -term vision for the business. For the business plan, a <br>three - to five -year projection is required. This projection can b e optimistic, but realistic enough. Projections <br>have to be based on industry rese arch along with business strategy. Ensure that there are no typing errors in <br>these statements; make use of accounting professionals if need be.  393 <br> 22.7.10 Appendix  <br>This section i ncludes all essential pieces of evidence the reader might want to refer to. These  include CVs, <br>product brochures, customer listings, testimonials, news articles, market research studies, detailed financial <br>calculations, projections and contracts.  <br>22.8 IDEN TIFY POTENTIAL INVESTORS  <br>Once you have a viable business plan for your start -up venture, you now need attract an investor or investors. <br>Investors mainly invest in the entrepreneur and the product offering. Investors consider the entrepreneur and <br>his or her  management team in terms  of their background and experience. Investors need assurance that their <br>investment will be managed well. Finding suitable investors can be a daunting task, you may need to speak to <br>many potential investors to find the right one fo r your business. Entrepre neurs also need to think about creative <br>funding models. There are a few funding models to grow their businesses.  Section 22.8.1  discusses these <br>different forms of additional funding.  <br>22.8.1 Eight guiding principles to find the right investor  <br>1. Angel networks:  also referred to as informal investors, are individuals w ho invest money, mentorsh ip <br>and a network of contacts. Angel investors accept risk and demand little or no control of the business. <br>These individuals are likely to be convinced by the entrepreneur’s passion, persistence and discipline.  <br>2. Crowdfunding:  a prac tice of raising money for  a venture by relying on the support of many different <br>investors, from the public to philanthropists, to experienced investors. People who contribute relatively <br>small amounts can raise large sums of money. Kickstarter, Thundafund, Gofundme and Justgiving a re <br>some of the most used crowdfunding platforms accessed online.  <br>3. Incubators and accelerators:  incubators and accelerators come with a wealth of resources and finances. <br>These investors are concerned with taking on a bigger role in t he venture with the inten tion of turning <br>the idea into a viable business model. The incubator offers resources such as physical space. Since <br>multiple businesses operate within the same building, this offers a great opportunity for networking. <br>Some South Af rican incubators include Rizcorp, Awethu, Timbali Technology and Incubator.  <br>4. Professional social networking sites:  a lot of professional networking sites such as LinkedIn, Xing, Plaxo, <br>Startup Nation and Meet -up connect the entrepreneur with numerous invest ors from across industrie s <br>and countries who want to participate in a global business environment.  <br>5. Private equity firms: one of the traditional forms of investment funding, these investors invest large <br>sums of money for a longer period. Private equity fund ers look for entrepreneur s who have contributed <br>their own money to the business, and who have a solid credit record, a good business plan and industry <br>expertise. Such investors require equity in the business until they decide to sell their shares. They <br>usually target businesses th at show signs of rapid growth.  <br>6. Personal marketing effort:  this entails personally marketing the start -up in the hopes of attracting a <br>suitable investor. This is done through websites, social networks, blogs and traditional media pl atforms.  <br>7. Friends and family:  attracting finance from friends and family should not be difficult; these individuals <br>know your passion and could be willing to assist you. If you choose to use this opportunity, make sure to <br>keep business and personal relation ships separate. Draw up a contract describing the terms of the <br>investment. Like any  start -up, this business involves risk; make sure friends and family members <br>understand that they might lose their investment. Do not jeopardise relationships over business.  <br>8. Government funds and grants:  the South African government offers both financial an d non -financial <br>assistance to previously disadvantaged entrepreneurs. Funding has to be paid back to the government, <br>albeit at better terms. Grants, however, do not have to be paid back. One can apply for funds and grants <br>through organisations such as: the  Department of Trade and Industry (DTI); the Enterprise and National <br>Empowerment Fund (NEF); the Small Enterprise Finance Agency (SEFA); and the Small Enterprise <br>Development  Agency (SEDA). This form of funding focuses on high -growth industries that will gr eatly <br>increase employment.  394 <br> 22.8.2 Alternative sources of funding  <br>• Trade credit:  this is an important tool of financing. Trade credit is the credit given to you by suppliers w ho <br>allow you to buy now and pay later. The entrepreneur can collect materials, equi pment or other valuables <br>at any time without paying cash on the spot.  <br>• Asset -based loans:  the entrepreneur will use the businesses equipment and inventory of facilities as se curity <br>for a loan. Some of the advantages are easily obtainable; the cost of borrow ing is lower and the value of <br>the business assets is added to the loan amount. Disadvantages are that lenders may want to verify <br>samples and examine larger transactions to e liminate bad debts.  <br>• Factoring of accounts receivables:  a business sells its account s receivables (invoices) to a third party (factor) <br>at a discount. The factor usually handles most of the transactions that occur after the sale, such as <br>sending out invoices  and collecting the funds that are due by customers. This form of financing is usua lly <br>used in tendering process. Some of the advantages of factoring are: no requirement of collateral; sale on <br>loan; evading bad debts; and immediate cash flow. Disadvantages  of this method are: reduction of profit; <br>higher finance charges; loss of personal touch; and unreliable customers may cause the factoring <br>company to restrict the entrepreneur from conducting business with a certain customer due to their poor <br>credit ration ). <br>• Loans:  these are granted after the financial statements have been analysed and a  small business credit score <br>is obtained. Banks or any other financial institution or individual can grant loans. Collateral or assets such <br>as inventory, facilities, equipme nt or the personal assets of the borrower are required to secure the loan. <br>Loans ar e convenient; financial institutions do not require profit sharing and tax breaks. However, <br>qualifying criteria are quite strict. Usually the banks will not grant a 100 per cent loan and the <br>entrepreneur can lose his or her collateral.  <br>• Leasing:  the lender  purchases the asset and then charges a monthly or some periodic fee for the lessor to <br>use it (purchase of fixed assets by lessor). This is a great way for the business to ma ke use of the resources <br>without taking ownership of them. This way, the business g ets a tax benefit, low capital expenditure  and <br>off balance -sheet debt. Despite the said advantages, leasing can still burden the business. It is expensive, <br>liable for mainten ance, limits access to other loans and reduces return for equity holders.  <br>• Relation ship lending:  this is the good friend loan. The lender has dealt with the borrower in the past and <br>grants a loan because of past success. There is often an ongoing advisory a nd guidance relationship <br>between the lender and borrower. This could be a bank or some other financial institution or individual.  <br> <br>22.9 PITCHING TO INVESTORS  <br>In addition to writing a business plan, the entrepreneur will be required to present it to potenti al investors. <br>This is not the time to present the entire plan, but the objective i s to spark the investor’s interest. The <br>entrepreneur is usually given 15−20 minutes to present, followed by a question -and-answer session. According <br>to Cummings (2012), entre preneurs need to keep the following 11 recommendations in mind as they prepare <br>their pitch:  <br>1. Tell a story:  begin with a compelling story that identifies a problem the business aims to solve.  <br>2. Have a solution:  explain what is unique about the business’s produ ct offering. Keep the explanation <br>concise and easy to convey. Only use buzz words or jargon if investors are familiar with those terms.  <br>3. Show success:  impress investors with what the entrepreneurial team have achieved thus far, such as <br>sales, product launch es and contracts.  <br>4. Give a target market:  be realistic about who the product offerin g is targeted at and break down your <br>market into total addressable market (TAM), segmented addressable market (SAM) and share of market <br>(SOM). This will assist you to think s trategically about your rollout plan.  <br>5. Mention customer acquisition:  questions such  as “how will customers be reached? How much will the <br>marketing costs? How will success be measured?” need to be considered.  395 <br> 6. Talk about the competition:  do not omit this sect ion. You need to identify competitors an d explain what <br>differentiates your busines s from theirs (value proposition). Cummings (2012) states that one way to do <br>this is to “show this slide in a matrix format, in which you list your competitors down the left side of the <br>page with your features or b enefits across the top and use check marks  to show what your company <br>offers and what your competitors lack”.  <br>7. Outline your revenue model:  this section is of the outmost importance to investors. You need to give <br>detail s about how revenue will be made. Be spe cific about the products and pricing and h ighlight how <br>the market is anxiously waiting for the product.  <br>8. Provide financial projections:  give details about projected revenue (per product) over the next three to <br>five ye ars. Make sure that the financials are a chievable. Investors pay more attention to  this section, as <br>the business needs to make financial sense before they invest.  <br>9. Highlight your team:  investors understand the importance of a good team running the business.  They <br>invest in the team first then the business. Therefore, share details about y our team, such as what makes <br>them suitable to run the business. In addition, share some skills set the team might be missing, such as <br>marketing, legal, accounting, and explai n if and how these will be outsourced.  <br>10. Explain funding needs:  who has already inve sted how much money in the business? Are there any share <br>options and how much more money is still needed? Explain what type of investment you are seeking; is <br>it just finance or equity partnership? Furthermore, remi nd the investors why your team is well equ ipped <br>to manage their investment.  <br>11. Briefly describe an exit strategy:  if you are seeking a large cash investment (over R1 million), you need <br>to explain your exit strategy. Are  you planning to sell the company, go pu blic or do you have any other <br>plans? What companies have you targeted to merge with in the future? Show that you have done due <br>diligence on the exit strategy.  <br>22.10 BUSINESS PRINCIPLES FOR LEADING IN THE FOURTH INDUS TRIAL REVOLUTION  <br>Intelligent robots, sel f-driving cars, mobile supercomputing, 3D printing, biotechnology, energy storage and <br>quantum computing. These all show evidence of the dramatic changes brought on by the Fourth Industrial <br>Revolution. Previous indust rial revolutions introduced humanity to digital capabilities. While this revolutio n, <br>focuses on machines and production systems that fuse “the physical, digital and biological worlds, impacting <br>all disciplines, economies and industries, and even challengin g ideas about what it means to be human”  (World <br>Economic Forum, 2018). Consequentl y, changing customer’s expectations, improving asset efficiency, <br>establishing new partnerships and producing new business models.  <br>So then how can a business play a significan t role in this present revolution? How c an entrepreneurs take <br>advantage of their b usiness strategies to capitalise on the market? How can businesses balance the <br>technological acumen needed with strategic skills to dominate the market? Schwieters and Moritz  (2017) offer <br>10 principles on becoming an industry giant in this Fourth Industria l Revolution.  <br>1. Rethink your business model:  do not fall into the trap of thinking that the business will continue making <br>profits using old models. Businesses that cleave to th is notion quickly lose market share. Thi s disruption <br>focuses on using artificial i ntelligence to reduce costs and increase production. Therefore, companies <br>that refuse to adapt to this new revolution will fall behind compared to those that adapt.  <br>2. Build you r strategy around platforms:  a platform is a system that connects customers to a w ide range <br>of merchants using the same hardware and software. The most successful platforms are Windows <br>(Microsoft); Everything Store (Amazon); iOS (Apple); Facebook (social m edia) and Google. Therefore, <br>these platf orms essentially influence the relationshi p businesses have with their customers.  <br>3. Design for customers:  this new infrastructure connects customers to producers like never before <br>through smartphones and social media. In designing new platforms, one has to b ear in mind the habits, <br>needs and longterm  interests of these customers. Therefore, platforms that genuinely cater to <br>consumer needs are of great importance. For this to be achieved, the business needs to upgrade its  <br>design intelligence. New design systems  need to be user friendly, that is, they n eed to be customisable 396 <br> without the assistance of an IT specialist. The more user friendly the systems are, the more appealing <br>they will be.  <br>4. Raise your technological acumen:  businesses need to introduce and upscale their workforce. Staff need <br>to be trained in the latest technological offering. They must also understand the security risks involved, <br>of cyber -attack, for example. This knowledge will ensure the business offers the best products and <br>platforms, thus ensuri ng them a competitive edge.  <br>5. Innovate rapid ly and openly:  disruptive and incremental innovation can both benefit the business. Even <br>though most businesses focus on disruptive innovation, smaller innovations are easier  to generate and <br>test in the market. The se smaller innovations can quickly escalat e to disruption. Disruptive innovation is <br>more impactful through collaboration with other stakeholders. Such collaborations occur through <br>artificial intelligence, autonomous machines, decentralised electrification and connected mobility.  <br>6. Learn more from yo ur data:  gathering and analysing data from customers helps businesses understand <br>new patterns that improve the businesses product offering. For example, a plastics company th at <br>notices customer use of polymer could recommend a different approach, based on an analys is of what <br>other companies have done with that same polymer. This is the value of data playing a pivotal role in <br>business strategy.  <br>7. Adopt innovative financing models : businesses need to find new ways of financing projects. For <br>example, software us ers do no t purchase packages any longer, they now subscribe to software -as-a-<br>service, therefore, paying rent in exchange for access. This type of financing method affects ret urns on <br>investments.  <br>8. Focus on purpose, not products:  in order to gain a competitiv e advanta ge, the business will have to <br>focus on its purpose. This means that its value proposition affects its business activities. One needs to <br>consider why customers prefer  your business, what they expect and what you can deliver. Focusing on <br>the purpose  allows t he business to deliver on its promise in turn gaining consumer’s trust.  <br>9. Be trustworthy with data:  businesses need to maintain utmost confidentiality when collecting and <br>analysing customers’ data. Businesses need to maintain leading -edge approaches  to guard  against <br>cyber -attack or theft.  <br>10. Put humanity above machines:  even though this industrial revolution places higher value on <br>technology, businesses can only flourish i n this era if they value human values. As technology becomes <br>the driving force and  replaces jobs, keep in mind that the most distinctive traits of the h uman workforce <br>will be their empathy, authenticity and intuitive judgment. These traits cannot be replac ed by artificial <br>intelligence.  <br>With this said, excelling in this revolution will d epend on the business’s ability to fuse technology, people and <br>busines s strategy in ways that it has never done before. The Fourth Industrial Revolution will not only bring <br>about financial prosperity, but also bring about stability and a high quality of li fe. Therefore, entrepreneurs <br>need to bear these 10 principles in mind when planning their businesses and strategies. Doing this will not <br>only ensure they remain competitive, but also benefit humankind.  <br>22.11 RESOURCES FOR WRITING A BUSINESS PLAN  <br>There are a number of resources available to help entrepreneurs write their bus iness plan. These include books, <br>YouTube videos, computer software packages and consultants. These resour ces are invaluable to the <br>entrepreneur. However, resist the temptation to adapt an  existing business plan as the plan should reflect your <br>vision for yo ur business. Below are some of the resources to consider:  <br>• Computer -based business planning:  there are var ious business plan software choices available to assist <br>entrepreneurs think over e very aspect of their business planning. Some include Liveplan and Enl oop. The <br>entrepreneur needs to keep in mind that software offers generic business plans, and, as such, ca n limit <br>the entrepreneur’s flexibility and creativity if used poorly. Keep in mind  that you as the entrepreneur <br>should know what should be in the plan.  The plan should communicate your vision. There is no magic <br>formula for writing a business plan; therefor e, if you understand the limitations of software, you can use it <br>wisely.  397 <br> • Professio nal assistance in business planning:  many small business owners lack formal business management <br>skills, and thus cannot answer some questions posed by investors. In this case , entrepreneurs need to <br>enlist the help of professional business advisors (account ants, attorneys, marketing specialists or <br>organisations such as SEDA) . It is preferable that they consult someone used to working with small <br>businesses, start -ups and other e ntrepreneurs who lack these skills. These professionals come with a <br>wealth of know ledge and experience that will assist you in this process. Neverthele ss, enlisting these <br>services is expensive. Some professionals charge hourly and some change a contingency  percentage based <br>on the amount raised. If you choose to hire a consultant, keep t he following in mind:  <br>– Get referrals:  ask business associates, colle agues and professionals such as bankers for names of any good <br>business consultants.  <br>– Look for a fit:  look for a consultant who has worked with similar businesses to yours. The consultant  needs <br>to have experience in same -size businesses in that particular field. At all costs, avoid general business <br>consultants who lack industry experience.  <br>– Check references:  obtain three names of entrepreneurs with whom the business consultant has worked.  <br>Contact the references to enquire about the consultant’s performance . Questions such as “was the business <br>plan completed on time and did it serve the intended purpose?” need  to be asked.  <br>– Get it in writing:  draw up a detailed legal document describing th e services of the consultant. The contract <br>should include the fee, da te of payment and circumstance under which services will be rendered.  <br>22.12 CONCLUSION  <br>This chapter cover ed the reasons for, and contents of, a business plan. Business -plan creation follo ws after an <br>opportunity to start up an enterprise is identified. A bu siness plan serves as a road map for the future. It details <br>what the business seeks to accomplish, clearl y indicating the when, how and by whom.  <br>Business plans are drawn up for various au diences: stakeholders, entrepreneurs, management, employees and <br>inves tors. Entrepreneurs should prepare business plans to gain an in -depth understanding of the potential, <br>intricacies and promise of the business.  <br>A standard layout of a business plan was pro vided as a preliminary planning guide. Help was given with <br>guidelines  on how to select the most appropriate business plan for each different situation. Potential problems <br>to be aware of when preparing a business plan were discussed, with tips given to avoi d these problems. The <br>Fourth Industrial Revolution’s influence on bus inesses today were discussed. Lastly, the chapter covered the <br>use of the internet, specialist organisatio ns and business -planning advisors when drawing up a business plan.  <br>REVIEW QUESTION S <br>22.1 What are the primary reasons for writing business plans?  <br>22.2 Describe the major sections found in a business plan.  <br>22.3 Identify problems to avoid when compiling a bu siness plan.  398 <br> Case study:  Bergville cooperative bakes its way to success  <br>Mduduzi Ts habangu  <br>Thulasizwe Shabalala was a newly qualified teacher when he left his job in 2011, after just two years, to start the Thuthukamzizi <br>Bakery Cooperative with five other p eople.  <br>Shabalala says he always had a passion for the business world and decided t o take a leap of faith by getting involved with the <br>cooperative.  The Thuthukamzizi Bakery Cooperative, which is based in Emazizini, south of Bergville, KwaZulu -Natal, was <br>registered in 2009. Members of the cooperative – Shabalala and five women – explored business ideas and the bakery was <br>identified as the most promisi ng. They approached the Small Enterprise Development Agency (SEDA) for help with their <br>business plan and have not looked back since. In 2010, the cooperative received a R250 000 grant from Old  Mutual, which <br>was used to build the facility where they work. T he building has five rooms, which include a baking area, storeroom, shop, <br>office and conference room. KZN Wild life also supported the group by buying them bakery equipment, a container, boreho le <br>and electrifying the premises. The KZN Department of Economic  Development, Environment and Tourism arranged training <br>and mentoring in baking for members of the cooperative . <br>In 2011, the cooperative applied for a grant from the National Development Agenc y (NDA) to buy baking machines and other <br>equipment. The applicat ion took about a year to process and was successful. The cooperative was granted R1.8 million, which <br>would be allocated in phases. Over the past five years, the NDA has supported 50 projects i n Kwa -Zulu-Natal, spending about <br>R77.7 million, according to NDA  CEO Dr Vuyelwa Nhlapo.  So far, the Thuthukamzizi Bakery Cooperative has received R850 <br>000. This was used to b uy a delivery truck, stock for the bakery, other machinery and to do electricity u pgrades.  <br>“When we started the cooperative we were working from a  container we received from KZN Wildlife. The container is now <br>being used as a tuckshop and is run by one of t he members. She keeps the money, which comes from the limited direct sales <br>that ta kes place from the premises,” said Shabalala.  <br>Besides bread, the  cooperative also makes scones, muffins, rolls and biscuits. Shabalala says the cooperative also sells soft <br>drinks to the community and bread to the local school. All of this takes hard work a nd the cooperative is busy throughout the <br>day, working on a thre e-shift system. “We supply local businesses such as B&Bs, hotels and tuckshops in the community. We <br>started by  making 600 loaves of bread per day and today the production has doubled.”  <br>The coo perative employs 14 young people on a contract basis who receive  a stipend from the NDA. Shabalala says one of <br>the cooperative’s biggest challenges is securing bigger contrac ts because they are competing with big companies. He adds <br>that their dream is for the business to be known throughout South Africa and expand to o ther areas such as growing and <br>selling vegetables.  <br>Source:  Adapted from  http://www.vukuzenz ele.gov.za/bergville -cooperative -bakes -its-way-success  <br>Questions  <br>1.

He grew up in Maluti in the Eastern Cape province and later moved to Benoni in <br>Ekurhuleni, Gauteng. A few years after matriculating, Sakhephi (Sakhe ) decided to study law at Free Sta te <br>University in Bloemfontein. Before completing his degree, he was encouraged by his brother Bruce to join <br>him in Pretoria. Owing to his versatile nature, he agreed and went  on to complete his law degree with  the <br>Universi ty of South Africa in Pretoria, an d in 2006 he obtained admission as an attorney. He opened his law <br>firm even though he felt that he did not possess enough business experience, given that he was only admitted  <br>two years earlier, and thought that he had to g ain at least five years experience  before opening his own practice. <br>Through reputation and professionalism, Gwabeni Incorporated (GI) managed to grow within a short space of <br>time. This is indeed a story of a law firm started from push factors, particularly  those setbacks within <br>conventiona l job settings which prompted a change in career trajectory.  402 <br> 23.1.2 Motivating factors to start an own business  <br>Sakhe had to quickly gather resources such as office space and  equipment through the help of family members. <br>His start -up costs were in the regi on of R140 000. He had to acquire a loan of R80 000 from the National <br>Youth Development Agency (previously known as Omsobomvu Youth Fund), and used his savings and some <br>famil y contributions. His previous secretary, Peggy L edwaba from his former employer wa s keen to join him. <br>Sakhe had to “hit the ground running”. Nevertheless he felt that he was ill -prepared for the new challenge of <br>having to compete with much more experienced  opponents and skeptical clients. As such, Sakhe  had to <br>approach his long -time fri end and business associate Lebogang Thakadu, who was also an attorney, as well <br>as other experienced lawyers for assistance and advise. GI somehow did very well, against all o dds, and this <br>is owing to its founder’s determin ation and that of the other staff members. “It took me two years instead of <br>three to make full repayments on my R80 000 loan.” The loan repayments were completed within the space <br>of two years, instead of thre e as per stipulations.  <br>23.1.3 Challenges  <br>As a bu siness owner, Sakhe faces a number  of challenges daily. Many South Africans still prefer to be <br>represented by larger law firms. There are also difficulties experienced when it comes to issues of late or non -<br>payment from clients and that affects the cash fl ow of the business in a big way. T here are new regulations, <br>which compel law firm directors such as Sakhe to follow a compulsory practice management course. Reactions <br>to this law are ambivalent given that som e view it as irrelevant and others such as GI pe rceive it as a “necessary <br>evil”. A dded to these requirements is the burden of adhering to laws covering tax, labour, occupational health <br>and safety, as well as other related business laws. Moreover, more ofte n than not GI is confronted with having <br>to compe te with difficult legal opponents and satisfy demanding clients.  <br>23.1.4 Diversification  <br>It was during 2013 that GI entered the transport business. This was informed by the need to expand the <br>business, even th ough this was a diversion from the core business. This was a typical example of co nglomerate <br>diversification, which often affords the or ganisation the opportunity to enter a completely new industry and <br>different lines of business. GI entered the passenger transport sphere in the Eastern Cape with the Road and <br>Transport Department and th e Department of Education. GI began running three bus operations, two of which <br>are subsidised by the Eastern Cape Road and Transport Department. The other bus route is as the  result of a <br>scholar transport tender with the Education Department. This is expec ted to grow in the future.  <br>23.1.5 Where to from here?  <br>With an average turnover of R17 million per annum, GI currently employs a minimum of seven full -time <br>employees, three of  whom are professionals and four are administrative staff. There are prospects for  growth <br>within the legal and transport industries and even beyond. For example, Sakhe is a sports fanatic, and <br>particularly loves his football, both locally and international ly. Currently, he is exploring ways in which GI <br>can serve as football players’ age ncy as this is fast becoming a growing and lucrative l ine of business.  <br>Sakhe endeavored to obtain FIFA accreditation and become a licensed international players’ agent. He wr ote <br>a few FIFA exams and has a few more to complete. He attempted to link up with the South African Football <br>Players’ Union but discover ed that it does not have much influence on player contracts and the industry still <br>needs  a lot of experienced union repr esentative for players. He still hopes to return to sports management and <br>intends to establish a sports management company that will man age all the legal contracts of its clients. If this <br>is realised, it will certainly be a true example of a concentric or related diversification strategy in action.  <br>Source:  Gwabeni Inc.: mighty@gwabeniin c.co.za  403 <br> 23.2 CASE 2: TSHEPISO SEMENYA: THE CALCULATING  ENTREPRENEUR  <br>According to Tshepiso, “gone are the days when young people say that ‘when I grow up, I want to become a <br>lawyer or to start my business’; in today’s life, you live your dreams, period. The re is no need to wait. The <br>earlier you begin to live y our life, the better”. At just 24, Tshepiso Semenya is living her dream life of being <br>a successful entrepreneur. Today, she owns two businesses that she runs from her SOHO offices (or small <br>office/ home  office) in her flat in Pretoria North, where she has renovated one of the bedrooms into an office.  <br>Judging by her current successes and achievements, it is difficult to imag ine that her life was once filled with <br>unimaginable difficulties and challenges. F rom not having food, dropping out of school and being the <br>permanent neighbourhood laughing stock, Tshepiso has seen and lived it all, but when life dealt her blows she <br>made t he most of them. Her life is the proverbial personification of the saying: “If lif e deals you lemons, make <br>lemonade.”  <br>Tshepiso is a nati ve of White City, Soweto. She was born and bred in Soweto, the place she now regards as <br>her entrepreneurial training gro und. As indicated above, Tshepiso’s life in Soweto was not easy. Nevertheless, <br>that brutal life taught her to be tough, self -reliant and  resourceful. Beyond this, surviving in the streets of <br>White City taught her two important business skills: (1) perceptu al skills; and (2) cost -benefit analysis. Simply <br>put, when an individual is said t o possess perceptual skills, it means that that person  has a heightened sense of <br>awareness. This is being conscious of one’s personal situation and the realities of one’s imm ediate <br>environment. In other words, “perceptual skills” is the ability to see and interpret the world around you. Cost -<br>benefit analysis,  on the other hand, is the ability to determine the potential benefits versus the costs of an <br>action. Tshepiso mastered these skills so much so that in 2010 when an opportunity to move to Pretoria <br>prese nted itself, she grabbed it. Being accepted at the Tsh wane University of Technology (TUT) in Pretoria <br>was the turning point in Tshepiso’s life. It not only liberated her from  a life of poverty, but it increased the <br>size of her world.  <br>Whilst pursuing her bu siness management studies at TUT, Tshepiso learnt abou t businesses and money. <br>Above all, university education broadened her world.  <br>Due to financial difficulties, she often dr opped in and out of school to take up odd jobs to pay school fees. In <br>2014, Tshepi so realised that she could not afford school. Despite having a recourse to NSFAS funding, her <br>conscience could not allow her to “lie on the application form so as to get the NSFAS funding.” Instead, she <br>decided to take a break from school and go into busin ess full -time. As she puts it, “Work came between me <br>and school, and finance also came between me and school”. Having analysed her situation carefully, in 2014 <br>Tshepiso decid ed to go into business and in the same year, she started a financial markets tradi ng business. <br>Her company, Tshemologo Trading, is an on line commodities trading company. It trades stock markets and <br>various commodities including gold, oil and foreign curren cy. <br>In 2016, after having noticed a gap in the market, Tshepiso started a second b usiness, Luxia Confections (Pty) <br>Ltd. The idea of this  business was sparked by the opportunity she saw when her friend was looking for pastries <br>and confections for a party. A t that moment she did a feasibility study and realised that the market, including <br>her friend, needed customised and good -quality cakes a nd pastries. More importantly, she calculated that she <br>could make a lot of money by producing these pastries. Luxia Conf ections employs six freelance consultants.  <br>Although Tshepiso concedes that running  a business is not easy, she agrees that it is fulfill ing. Tshepiso <br>acknowledges that she derives her motivation from the poverty she still sees today in Soweto. People in he r <br>neighbourhood do not expect much from themselves. According to Tshepiso, “Even i f you end up being a <br>drug addict and a failure, no one  sees a problem with that”. By making a life out of entrepreneurship Tshepiso <br>hopes to show that there is more to life.  <br>Over the years, Tshepiso has learnt a lot in business. The single most important l esson she has learnt is <br>understanding what money is a nd knowing what it can and cannot do. “Money,” Tshepiso explains, “is an 404 <br> idea; it is not tangible. When you decide to sel l sweets, the proceeds from selling sweets is not money. The <br>idea to sell sweets i s the money.” Some of Tshepiso’s business lessons are  the following:  <br>• Business is about learning. Keep on learning and embrace new ideas. Remember, ideas are money.  <br>• In life, a lways have a plan.  <br>• Don’t just go to school without a plan.  <br>• Don’t exploit your back ground or use certain factors to get ahead, for example through becoming a BEE <br>tenderpreneur. Work hard and build your business.  <br>• Keep your standards high.  <br>23.3 CASE 3: BUSINE SS SUCCESS AND POVERTY ALLEVIATION THROUGH A POULTRY <br>BUSINE SS <br>23.3.1 Introduction  <br>After being retrenched from work as a furniture -store saleswoman, Gladys Masombuka stayed at home for <br>two years without employment. With an ill husband and three children to support, Gladys relied on her <br>husband’s disability grant an d getting odd jobs as a  domestic worker. Even though she found life difficult, <br>Gladys was determined to succeed and was constantly exploring ways to improve her situation. However, she <br>could not fi gure out how to go about improving her living conditions or  finding a breakthrough  to that effect.  <br>23.3.2 Journey to redemption  <br>One day during May 2013, she was employed to do domestic duties for somebody who owned a poultry farm, <br>which had a processing si te. She was thus introduced to the poultry business. It is noteworthy that Gladys <br>grew up in an environment of subsistence farming at her parents’ home in Dennelton, Limpopo Province. As <br>such, the poultry business was not really unfamiliar territory even t hough the conditions, size and technology <br>were different. S he was made aware of th e unit which coordinates farming business projects from the <br>departments of Rural and Land Reform, Trade and Industry as well as Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. <br>Gladys wa s told that there were many opportunities in the poultry bu siness as chicken eggs were deemed the <br>fourth largest animal product in agriculture in South Africa, which accounted for almost R3,5 billion annually <br>at current production levels.  <br>Gladys registered  a company called Gladmaso Poultry Passion (GPP). She acqui red the necessary train ing and <br>soon received as start -up loan and was allowed to occupy a small piece of land in Hammanskraal, situated 80 <br>kilometers from Pretoria, together with other small -scale farmers. Through diligence and hard work, GPP <br>began to find  its resonance and rhyt hm within the poultry industry and managed to secure a few lucrative <br>contracts of suppling government institutions and local businesses with products such as eggs and chicken . <br>Within the space of 13 months Gladys was confident that s he had managed to allev iate poverty and thereby <br>improve the living conditions of her loved ones. Furthermore, a total of 14 people of the 31 staff component <br>of GPP are Gladys’s immediate family, fr iends and relatives. This seems to be making a real differe nce in the <br>lives of ord inary people within the community.  <br>23.3.3 Challenges and lessons learned  <br>• Insufficient business experience makes growth of the business a challenge.  <br>• Due to the relatively smal l farm size, GPP is unable to lure big business.  <br>• Due to its  location at a peripher al side of the country, some opportunities in the market are limited.  <br>• There is lack of adequate infrastructure such as tarred roads, regular running water and sanitation as w ell <br>reliable sources of energy. As such, GPP relies heavily  on the optimum use of limited resources.  405 <br> • Moreover, eggs enjoy the same status of precious metals such as gold and diamonds given their fragile <br>nature and perishability.  <br>• The company further strives  to become a dependable partner and supplier to all its sup ply-chain <br>participants,  such as tiers, suppliers, customers and distributors.  <br>23.3.4 Future prospects and opportunities  <br>GPP is seeking to collaborate with established industry players such as Rainb ow Chicken (which is a <br>subsidiary of RCL Foods) and Allas Egg Basket, which may ou tsource some of their processes.  <br>Furthermore, GPP further hopes to secure lucrative deals with th e five main retailers such as Shoprite -<br>Checkers, Pick n Pay, Spar, Woolworths  and MassMart.  <br>More training is required in terms of marketing and the technical a spects of running poultry business.  <br>GPP is also seeking to find business opportunities beyond the  country’s borders, particularly within the SADC <br>and BRICS community.  <br>Sources  and links accessed:  http://www.sapoultry.co.za/pdf -statistics/Poultry -meat-egg-stats -<br>summary.pdf ; http://www.rclfoods.com/  <br>23.4 CASE 4: GAGASINI BROKERS – FAST -GROWING FINANCIAL S ERVICES AND <br>PRODUCT INSURANCE PROVIDERS  <br>23.4.1 History and background  <br>Gagasini Brokers (GB) was e stablished by Jay Mngoma and two other shareholders, Zwelihle Magojo and <br>Nomf undo Biyela. The business was founded by Jay in 1993 as a sole proprietor. Over th e year it has expanded <br>to become a close corporation after two people joined the business. The de cision to have new business <br>associates was an easy one for Jay as Zwelihle an d Nomfundo brought along a wealth of experience.  <br>23.4.2 Shareholders  <br>The business has been growing at a rapid pace ever since the new directors joined Jay in the late 90s. However , <br>this transition called for a huge adjustment for Jay who now needed to make  collective decisions as opposed <br>to making decisions alone, which was previously t he case at GB. However, Jay was appreciative of the great <br>minds represented in these new codirect ors for the organisation. On the other hand, Zwelihle and Nomfundo <br>had to get  used to paying more attention to detail and remaining highly ethical as Jay foste red military <br>precision within GB. Moreover, Jay acquired project planning, resource preparation a nd project focus from <br>his previous mentors and these attributes came in handy  for the broker business in which he was involved. <br>After training, Jay managed to set up his own business as a broker selling financial products and services to <br>several insurance companies. A minimum of R40 000 was required for a broker business to be esta blished. <br>Jay managed to use R30 000, which he acquired through his savings and a f urther R10 000 as a loan from <br>First National Bank. These funds were utilised to set up operationa l infrastructure and were also to be used as <br>working capital.  <br>23.4.3 Challeng es faced  <br>• Very few black South Africans were involved in the insurance brokering bu siness at this time.  <br>• Access to capital funding is still a daunting hurdle for emerging businesses . <br>• It is difficult to secure, grow and sustain a sizeable client base in the i nsurance business.  <br>• Delayed payments by some key clients may sometimes exert cash f low problems.  406 <br> • Rapid changes in technology may render the operating system obsolete and to keep up , some additional <br>capital injection may be required.  <br>• The rand/dollar exchange  may affect the marginal propensity to invest in education.  <br>• Stringency of laws wit hin the insurance industry.  <br>These challenges very much dictated the parameters within which GB could thrive. As such, the organisation <br>had to constantly analyse the environme nt in which it operated. The industry handbook is constantly changing <br>and this aff ects the organisation’s stra tegic relevance to the target market.  <br>23.4.4 Achievements  <br>Today, GB is a multimillion rand business, which is growing fast within the SADEC region  and it is expected <br>to grow and do business on the international stage.  <br>Jay and hi s business associates have b uilt a strong brand as resistance to counter its rivals.  A stronger client <br>base has been built through a vigorous relationship management approach . <br>Source:  http://www.gagasinibrokers.c o.za/about.html  <br>23.5 CASE 5: CASSPER NYOVEST: THE MUSICAL ENTREPRENEUR  <br>Cassper Nyovest is a South African rapper, musician, recording artist and m usic producer. His real name is <br>Refiloe Maele Phoolo, and he was born in Mafikeng in the North West province. Cassper, as he is known by <br>his fans, is one of the many musical entrepreneurs in South Africa, which also include Zahara, Oskido, Yvonne <br>Chaka Cha ka, DJ Cleo and many others. Yes, Cassper is an entrepreneur! Just like any other entrepreneur who <br>produces a product or service to sell it for a profit, Cassper Nyovest and many other musicians produce a <br>unique product called music, and sell it for profit . If you cannot directly link music and entrepreneurship, think <br>about the followin g: <br>• How do musicians make mon ey? <br>• If they do not sell records and tickets at live performances, how would they earn a living?  <br>• Why are musicians always trying to stop music pira cy? <br>While most people recognise that being a musician requires talent, they fail t o acknowledge that music is a <br>serious business. It is not just about talent, a good voice, dance moves and videos; it involves careful planning <br>and proper management. To be s ustainable, large amounts of money are required – for advertising, paying for <br>venu es, salaries for musicians, and several other expenses.  <br>The Ticketpro Dome, which is often referred to as the Dome, is situated in Northgate, Johannesburg. With a <br>maximum cap acity of 19 000 people, the Dome is well -known for hosting numerous music concerts  and both <br>local and internat ional artists (Ticketpro Dome, 2016). Some of the big names to perform at the Dome include <br>the likes of Roxette, Lionel Richie, Mariah Carey and G eorge Benson. Many of these international superstars <br>easily fill up the dome to ca pacity. But, such a feat had  never been achieved by a solo local South African <br>artist. Cassper saw an opportunity. Filling up the Dome was Cassper’s vision. Cassper saw that local artists’ <br>shows were not as effectively marketed as international gigs. His p lan was to leverage social m edia marketing <br>under the hashtag #FillUpTheDome. Soon Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram were all abuzz and it <br>was not long before mainstre am media picked up the story. After appealing to South Africa to “support local <br>talent”, many heeded the call.  On 31 October 2015, Cassper realised his dream and filled up the Dome.  407 <br> 23.6 CASE 6: MOKGWADI UPHOLSTERY CLINIC (MUC) – FAMILY BUSINESS CASE <br>STUDY  <br>After his father was murdered by armed robbers, Tshepo Mokgwadi had to make a dif ficult call of taking over <br>as head of the family business. It is customary in Sepedi culture for the eldest son to assume certain leadership <br>positions within the family and i ts businesses once the father thereof passes on. Tshepo was trained as a sales <br>engineer and had worked with hi s father in the carpet and upholstery business, and so his family put their <br>entire faith in him to sustain the business. To take over from his fat her Jansen, who was a selftaught upholstery <br>maker, Tshepo had to put his dream of furthering his studies of be coming an industrial engineer on hold.  <br>The late Jansen was a perfectionist even though he was self -taught. He also had a passion for service and h ad <br>a warm interpersonal approach with regard to his clients. As a parttime clergym an, Jansen often allowed his  <br>clients to receive repair services on credit or sometimes for free. As such, many of the MUC debts were bad <br>and had to be written off. Cash flow was therefore a huge challenge. Sometimes the repair of equipment would <br>be delayed  and the price of some of th e materials and fabrics to make couches and daybeds increased.  <br>23.6.1 Critical decisions to be made  <br>Tshepo had to make tough decisions trying to k eep the family business afloat. He attended a business forum <br>imbizo, which was org anised by the South African Trade and Industry and BRICS SMMEs division. Among <br>those in attendance were the Chinese delegates wh o made a great impression on him. These delega tes hinted <br>at possibilities of suppling him with material and  fabrics at a very af fordable rate. Moreover, the demands for <br>MUC services were on the rise. The deal seemed to be lucrative. Tshepo requested also t hat his cousin Obed <br>who had an accounting degr ee join the family business to enable MUC to exercise stronger financial controls <br>and also solve their cash flow problem.  <br>Tshepo appreciated the significance of networking and also the challenge of having to ma nage the family. He <br>knew that family expectati ons had to be managed and their legitimate claims needed to be considered at all <br>times. He therefore established a board of trustees to adjudicate on complex matters. A clear separation of <br>family matters and bu siness affairs had to be put in place.  <br>23.6.2 Family business challenges  <br>• Tshepo had great marketing and entrepreneurial skills b ut relied heavily on Obed’s help in terms of <br>accounting, financial management and reporting.  <br>• Jansen’s untimely death and poor su ccession planning meant that family members we re ill -prepared to <br>assume the responsibilities that Jansen left behind.  <br>• Ever -incre asing prices of fabrics and complex protocols for imports were challenging.  <br>• There was a limited amount of working capital, which  frustrated growth prospects.  <br>• There was a lack  of business mentoring.  <br>• There were limited advisory services.  <br>23.6.3 Way forward  <br>MUC intends to grow its business across the SADC region and beyond. Strategic partnerships are thus <br>envisaged with the prospect o f entering into strategic alliances, backward vertical integration, forward vertical <br>integration as well as horizontal integrati on (in the future as this will mean that competitors will be absorbed). <br>With strategic alliances in place, Chinese suppliers wil l be engaged in order to secure agreements, so  that <br>MUC can receive materials cheaper and faster. Moreover, the company seeks to  align its business interests <br>with those of other SADC countries, such a Mozambique, as more than 18 million consumers make the SACD <br>countries a lucrative market space. Where  possible, competitors may also be engaged to assist in growing the <br>upholstery bus iness.  408 <br> Internet links and sources accessed:  http://www.globalm arket.com/textile -leather -<br>25.html?gclid=CJWC3IGmu80CFYpAGwodeRgNEA ; http://www.nathaninc.com/  <br>23.7 CASE 7: FROM JUST RUBBISH TO A PROFESSIONAL RECYCLING BUSINESS  <br>23.7.1 Introduction  <br>A tough decision ha d to be made: recycle or risk dropping out of school. Samuel Mokonyane was confron ted <br>with this predicament. It was in 1995 when 15 -year-old Sam had to find ways to sustain his Grade 10 schooling <br>on his own. Sam was a disciplined and bright young man who h ad ambitions of becoming an economist after <br>school. Born into a Christian family t o parents who were religious ministers, Sam was concerned about his  <br>difficult upbringing given that his parents did not receive regular stipends from the congregations they s erved. <br>He was ambivalent about this: on one hand he was bitter about his situation , and on the other, he wanted to <br>find a solution.  <br>23.7.2 First oppo rtunity  <br>His teacher, Mrs van der Merwe introduced Sam to the recycling business. He got an incentive of R2 for every <br>50 cans he collected. At first Sam collected an average of 250 per day, which earned him R10 a day. That was <br>enough for him to use on his t ransport and budget meal. Mrs van der Merwe opened opportunities for Sam to <br>buy food from the school tucksh op at a discounted rate and that increased the value of the R10 he earned per <br>day. The passion for recycling increased on a daily basis and Sam never  looked back. He spent most of the <br>income he earned on transport and food as he was still a secondary schoo l learner. Very little money was left <br>to save and this made the project unsustaina ble. Moreover Sam did not have a savings culture as such; Sam <br>saw n othing wrong in sometimes spending his entire daily income. Little did he know that there needed to be <br>some  form of investment savings made no matter how small the income might have seemed.  <br>23.7.3 Support and partnership  <br>It was after his classmate and friend Thabiso joined him in the recycling project that Sam’s fortunes started <br>looking up. Thabiso (17), the so n of a primary school teacher and a grandson of an illustrious taxi owner <br>became e xposed to the significance of ed ucation and small -business management at a tender age. Thabiso <br>introduced Sam to new business territories where large -scale can collection was  possible.  <br>Given Sam’s keenness to learn and his enthusiasm, the pair soon embarke d on massive can collection <br>exercises. These yielded favourable returns and invaluable experience so far as the recycling business is <br>concerned.  <br>23.7.4 Challenges faced  <br>• Sam n ever received any business education and relied heavily on a trial -and-error appro ach, which made his <br>prospects of  success uncertain.  <br>• Sam and Thabiso had limited experience in the venture they were pursuing. As a result, only passion, <br>determination and the  desire to break their poverty cycle through education encouraged them.  <br>• There were  days that the business partners  would get discouraged, for example if key clients were delayed <br>with their payments.  <br>• The pair operated the business as survivalist entrepreneu rs given that a large portion of the cash flow was <br>often consumed by pressing pers onal needs, such as food and tra nsportation.  <br>• Limited resources (time, money and capacity) were a reality for the partners. For instance, during weekdays <br>nothing seemed to be happening businesswise as the pair attended school. Business activities were thus <br>relegated to after hours and dur ing the weekends.  409 <br> • Even though Mrs van der Merwe played the role of mentor, this was only done sporadically, and no <br>deliberate system was in pl ace. <br>• Sam often felt isolated and ridiculed by his peers who viewed his business pr oject as something done by <br>nobod ies. <br>• The venture was very labour intensive and all the negative human factors could not be easily averted.  <br>23.7.5 Achievements and future pros pects  <br>Sam went on to acquire his MBA and Thabiso holds an honours degree in intern ational finance. Today, Sam, <br>Thabiso and two other silent shareholders operate a multimillion -rand recycling and ecosystem consulting <br>business called Tsosoloso (Pty) Ltd, whi ch employs a total of 31 people. Tsosoloso aims to collaborate with <br>large recyclin g and printing firms such as Rem ade and Sappi whose strategic clients include municipalities <br>and large industries. Despite the challenges, Tsosoloso plans to diversify by als o recycling items such as cast -<br>off office paper like stationery and computer paper ; old invoices and printed docum ents; magazines; <br>newspapers; books; telephone books; advertising material such as flyers; posters and pamphlets; cardboard <br>boxes; and office e quipment. They would like to make a contribution towards the ecosystem, ensure cle aner <br>cities and towns while also  improving the living standards of communities. As such, the economy is likely to <br>grow as the recycling business becomes more effective and Ts osoloso can employ more staff and grow the <br>business. Tsosoloso appreciates the fac t that recycling is one of the f astest -growing businesses across the <br>globe. Moreover, the cost of capital is relatively low and everybody with a willing spirit can partake in  the <br>recycling business.  <br>Internet links and sources <br>accessed:  http://www.remade.co.za/default.php?ipkCat=8&sid=8 ; http://www.sappi.com/regions/sa/Sappi SouthernAfrica/rec<br>ycling/Pages/ default.aspx  <br>23.8 CASE 8: EMERGING MOTOR MECHANIC  <br>23.8.1 Introduction  <br>From a very early age, Jabu Mhlanga found joy in working with motor vehi cles. As early as four, Jabu started <br>spending time at his father Benson Mhlanga’s motor -mechanic workshop. His fat her, a self -taught backyard <br>mechanic, encouraged and taught his son how to repair, spray -paint, diagnose and drive cars. This made an <br>impressi on on Jabu and ignited his desire to pursue the auto -mechanic route as this was an  available <br>opportunity to Jabu, whose life was very difficult for him. The young Jabu learned as much as possible with <br>regard to cars from his father. Benson has since retire d due to old age and his poor state of health.  <br>23.8.2 Succession  <br>Jabu, who is now 48 years old, found a government -funded house in which he lives with his wife Nkele (45) <br>and two children Matilda (24) and Benson (Jr) (17). He managed to build an open shelt er at the front end of <br>his yard, which he uses to fix and service  cars for a fee. He is assisted by a few workshop artisans and his <br>family.  <br>23.8.3 Support and networks  <br>In 2014, Jabu received a call from an old friend who told him to urgently contact the Au tomotive Industry <br>Development Centre (AIDC). The AIDC is a commis sioned agency, wh ich is partnering with government, <br>higher education institutions and automotive industry participants such as the University of South Africa, Ford <br>and Nissan. It is a Gauteng  Growth and Development Agency (GGDA) subsidiary. Moreover, the A IDC was <br>establish ed by government as its support centre to increase the local automotive industry’s global <br>competitiveness and to promote Gauteng as the automotive industry investment destina tion of choice. This 410 <br> was to be done through skills and capacity d evelopment. As su ch, smaller businesses within the industry, such <br>as panel beaters, mechanics and electricians were identified by the AIDC as people targeted for inclusion in <br>its skills devel opment programmes.  <br>Both registered and unregistered businesses, p articularly those  in townships, were earmarked for skills <br>development, mentoring and other support. According to the AIDC, the Winterveldt Automotive Hub offers <br>artisans some form of mentorin g and training through the master artisans located at the facilit y. Its aim is to <br>develop township automotive enterprises. However, not all artisans/mechanics can be housed in hubs such as <br>Winterveldt. Jabu soon learned from the project coordinator that as  a backyard mechanic, he was also eligible <br>to join the programme.  Jabu informed hi s wife and the rest of the family as well as his workshop assistant and <br>the news was met with great excitement.  <br>23.8.4 Mentorship and training  <br>After a first briefing, Jabu an d 42 other mentees were assigned mentors who were set to offer bu siness <br>coaching a nd advisory services. The programme was divided into both technical and managerial skills for the <br>automotive business. As a mechanic, Jabu was taught how to diagnose a vehicl e, quote and do basic and <br>extensive repairs. On the managerial si de, Jabu had to l earn how to do basic financial management, customer <br>service, marketing, basic admin and how to develop strategic documents such as concept and business plans. <br>The latter was done in partnership with the University of South Africa, while th e former skills w ere acquired <br>through the Automobile Association. Jabu and his mentor had to identify his business’s problem areas and <br>pockets of excellence. Moreover, these areas of improvem ent had to be categorised into items that required <br>funding and th ose that merely n eeded conceptual thinking and effort. For instance, the purchasing of heavy <br>workshop equipment was put on hold until funding was received. However, aspects such as developing  a <br>Facebook page, flyers and signage were identified as those tha t could be immedi ately executed. Jabu’s family <br>assisted immensely with regard to the latter.  <br>23.8.5 Where to from here?  <br>Jabu plans to expand his business through networks and partnerships. Th is opportunity came from him gaining <br>access to the Winterveldt Au tomotive Hub, whe re more business and mentoring opportunities could arise. <br>Now that he has completed the AIDC project, he plans to use the concept plan that he has developed to attract <br>fundin g from organisations such the Development Bank of Southern Africa  and its partners . His family is also <br>keen to take part in the business by offering some administrative and technical support. His wife Nkele and <br>daughter Matilda will assist with the adminis trative side of the business while his son Benson will offer <br>technical support.  <br>Even though Jabu employs a few workshop assistants on a part -time basis, he hopes to grow his business to <br>become one of the most successful family businesses operating within t he automotive industry. Even though <br>these dreams are not yet full y realised, the b usiness is starting to show some signs of growth. Jabu is thankful <br>to all those who took part in the resuscitation of the business. His objective is to create jobs and  better  the <br>community in which the business is situated.  <br>Links and sourc es accessed:  Automotive Industry Development Centre (http://www.aidc.co.za/ ); Department of Trade and <br>Industry (http://www.thedti.gov.za/a bout_dti.jsp ); Un iversity of South Africa, College of Economic & Management Sciences <br>Community Engagement Portfolio  <br>23.9 CASE 9: INTRAPRENEURSHIP AS A GROWING TREND  <br>Intrapreneurship has been a growing trend over a few decades. This is the result of great i ncentives as well  as <br>the hunger for creative ideas to accompany solutions. Sindi and Melany, the two Little Masters Nursery School <br>teachers were keen to provide additional services for kids a nd parents. Since their nursery school had been run 411 <br> for over 20 y ears, they notice d how easy it was for complacency to creep in as routine took precedence. As a <br>result, the school was at risk of reaching a point of stagnation. Moreover, there were several competitors in <br>the area that had since entered the market and the y seemed to be do ing well. Little Masters needed better ways <br>of doing things to keep up with the competition.  <br>23.9.1 What Little Masters offers  <br>Little Masters provides formal learning, extram ural activities as well and basic child care. These are offered <br>during the week, f rom Monday to Friday. The opening times are between 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Newborns to <br>six-year-old children are welcome. Even though this is a Christian school, children of different beliefs are also <br>accommodated. A wide spread of nutriti ous diets includi ng halaal are provided. The school is well equipped <br>with materials and apparatus for the development of cognitive and physical skills.  <br>23.9.2 Challenges  <br>• Not all parents are c ooperative in terms of regular and timely payment of school fees.  <br>• Not all children  learn the same way or as quickly; at times intense pedagogical approaches are required.  <br>• Businesses in the area are often prone to security risks and crime waves. As such sec urity ought to be <br>increased so as to respond to possible threats by protecting liv es and property.  <br>• Ever -changing regulatory frameworks from the departments of Social Devel opment, Health and Basic <br>Education. These frameworks dictate how children ought to be  taught and taken care of.  <br>• Operational costs such as electricity, rates and taxes,  food and salaries are forever escalating, while there is <br>constant reluctance by parents to adhere to fee increases.  <br>23.9.3 Internal initiatives and opportunities  <br>The pair se t up an after -care services for parents who are, for one reason or the other, keen  to leave their kids <br>outside the normal day -time hours. This is something that the employ er supports even though the <br>responsibility to see this initiative through lies with t he pair. Many parents have warmed to the offer that Little <br>Masters now provides in  terms of after -hours care.  <br>Some parents are keen to leave their kids in the hands of cap able caregivers while they catch up on a dinner <br>date, prepare for university or colle ge assessments or even resolve work deadlines and/or crises. An increasing <br>number of people support this unique after -hours care idea. It is still difficult to accurately quantify the exact <br>earnings per evening, which are generated from this initiative. Ho wever, a figure of between R1 200 and R2 <br>000 per evening is possible, at the rate of R100 per hour per child.  <br>Sindi and Melany hope to grow the initiative and this can ser ve as a good example of intrapreneurship. More <br>internal or corporate entrepreneurship  is thus encouraged as this can help ordinary employees to start <br>entrepreneurially . There is also hope of collaborating with other nursery schools such as Tango Tots and L ittle <br>Giants. The initiative can only grow, and this is set to benefit Sindi and Mela ny, Little Masters and the <br>surrounding communities.  <br>Other sources accessed:  http://www.littlegiantsnursery -school.co.za/wmenu.php  <br>23.10 CASE 10: RICHARD MAPONYA: THE MAN BEHI ND MAPONYA MALL  <br>Richard Maponya is a South African serial entrepreneur and t he own er of Maponya Mall  in Soweto, a <br>township south of Johannesburg. Soweto is the largest township in South Africa and home to over five million <br>inhabitants. Because of apartheid  laws that classified residential areas according to race, Soweto was <br>design ated a s one of the townships reserved for black people. Back then, black people were prohibited from <br>engaging in any economic activity including entrepreneurial activities. As a re sult, there were no formal shops, 412 <br> shopping centres or malls in townships. Si nce it  opened its doors in 2007, the mall has become the economic <br>hub of Soweto.  <br>By the end of 2015, it was estimated that over 900 000 customers visit the over 200 shops in the ma ll every <br>month (Maponya Mall, 2016). These include a variety of supermarkets , shop s, banks and even a cinema, but <br>how did it all begin? Although Maponya Mall was officially opened on 27 September 2007 (Maponya Mall, <br>2016), its planning took close to 30 yea rs (Moya, 2005). Richard Maponya was very dissatisfied with the <br>status quo i n the 1970s; Soweto had no economic activity and its residents had to travel to the Johannesburg <br>CBD to shop and to work. The young Maponya saw the opportunity to build a shopping mall in the township, <br>which would centralise economic activities, and transf orm So weto into a thriving “city” (Moya, 2005).  <br>In the late 1970s, Maponya started working towards his vision. In 1977 when he acquired land on which the <br>mall stands, the apartheid  government denied him a trading licence. Despite countless attempts and fai lures,  <br>Richard Maponya did not give up on his dream. Instead, throughout this time – between 1977 and 2007 – <br>Maponya honed his business and entrepreneurship skills. It was only in 2007 under the new democratic <br>government that Maponya managed to secure the requir ed authorisation and financing to finally open the <br>Maponya Mall.  <br>23.11 CASE 11: SHINGIE CHIVIZHE: THE SERIAL ENTREPRENEUR  <br>Shingie Chivizhe is a vibrant and passionate entrepr eneur. He breathes, talks and dreams (when he sleeps) <br>entrepreneurship. What  separ ates Shingie from other traditional entrepreneurs is that Shingie is a serial <br>entrepreneur. Unlike traditional entrepreneurs who focus on one business venture at a time, seri al <br>entrepreneurs start multiple (a series of) businesses at the same time. G eneral ly, traditional entrepreneurs are <br>involved in the day -to-day management of their companies; serial entrepreneurs start the business and identify <br>suitably qualified people to run the business for them. Some of the world -famous serial entrepreneurs are  <br>Richa rd Branson (Virgin Group of Companies), Oprah Winfrey ( Oprah  TV show and Harpo Productions Inc), <br>and Donald Trump ( The Apprentice  and The Trump Organisation).  <br>23.11.1 Backgro und <br>The world has always been small for Shingie; he always aspired for somet hing b igger and greater. As a young <br>boy, in the streets of Harare, Shingie started several small businesses selling sweets and confectionary to other <br>school kids. Shingie credited his enterprising trait to his upbringing. It is also his belief that entrepr eneurs hip <br>can be taught: the earlier, the better. At times his parents could not understand where he got his money from, <br>suspecting him at times of stealing or being involved in il legal activities. From the first time Shingie <br>experienced the exuberance of making  his own money he never looked back. So much so that when he finished <br>high school, he realised that Zimbabwe was too small for him. He migrated to South Africa in the early 1 990s <br>to pursue his studies. Shingie had a 10 -year plan that was simple and e ffecti ve. It was a two -pronged initiative <br>that sought to: (a) improve his theoretical knowledge about entrepreneurship and the world around him and <br>(b) polish his personal selling skills. To achieve the former, he enrolled at the University of KwaZulu -Nata l <br>to pursue studies in chemical engineering. After successfully achieving his degree, he intentionally went to <br>work for a leading global water -treatment firm in Johannesburg as a t echnical sales engineer – selling water -<br>treatment solutions to industrial cl ients.  <br>The job involved a lot of travel, target -driven selling and interactions with clients from a broad spectrum <br>across the city.  <br>It exposed him to global selling practices and s ales philosophies; he tapped into the corporate’s knowledge -<br>based resources. The t raining was top notch, so was the mentoring and constant coaching.  413 <br> A career in sales helped him understand the business cycle and how pivotal sales were to  the enterprise; mo st <br>importantly how to create sustainable relationships with people (which in the l ong term translated into business <br>opportunities). Every entrepreneur creates a network of relationships around his enterprise.  Through this, <br>Shingie learnt everything that ne eded to be learnt about business beyond the theories in the books. He professes <br>that sales experience is an “absolute necessity for any entrepreneur”. He adds:  <br>Sales teaches one to improve one’s emotional int elligence, opportunity recognition skills and mo st importantly <br>personal discipline, a skillset, which every business person needs (internal - and external -based traits). It <br>teaches one to have a pragmatic approach – the proverbial plan, think act and review  way. The target setting <br>teaches you to optimise  your efforts so that they yield results soonest.  <br>During his working days, Shingie  says he not only invented but also experimented and tested The <br>Entrepreneur’s Toolkit (TET), which is a set of eight rules an  entrepreneur should follow if they are to be <br>successful in their businesses. Shingie attributes his success to TET; and today he is loyal to the eight TET <br>principles:  <br>1. Start small. Every business grows.  <br>2. Wake up early every day, preferably before sunrise.  <br>3. Your business plan is your business bible.  <br>4. Know y our key selling points. Sell, sell and sell.  <br>5. Cash flow is king. Manage it.  <br>6. Your bu siness operates in your environment. Study the environment.  <br>7. Know when to cash in and move on.  <br>8. Above all, live a healthy life a nd devote time to your family; they are your bac kbone.  <br>Like any great entrepreneur, Shingie always had a grand plan. Part of his p lan was also to have all his <br>associates become disciples of his TET principles. His very first disciple was his wife, Kholofel o. At the time <br>that TET was developed Kholo was working for a leading multinational telecommunications company in <br>Johannesburg. Sh ingie asked his wife to run a few experiments his newly found “entrepreneurial secrets” at <br>her workplace. The results were rem arkable. Mrs Chivizhe subsequently resigned from  her job in 2012, and <br>today practices TET with Shingie at their venture, Unathi Pi ping Pumps & Valves <br>(http://www.unathippv.co.za ). Much of Shingie’s in fluence has been moulded by Steve Covey’s  Seven <br>principles of highly effective people , as well as other writings from contemporary  writers like Tom Corley and <br>Nathan Jamail. Shingie believes a good entrepreneur should read a lot. This creates a well -rounde d view on <br>life. <br>23.11.2 The beginning  <br>Shingie sa ys he was attracted to the world of entrepreneurship by a combination of push and pull factors. Pull <br>factors were mostly internally based such as the need to see more, do more, experience more, and obviously <br>achieve more. Push factors are mostly external ( to the entrepreneur) and these include feelings of being stuck <br>in a rut, rapidly d iminishing job satisfaction etc. A combination of these factors sets in motion introspection <br>and hard questions. “If I can do this at work, can I not do this for myself given  the right resources and support?” <br>This set Shingie out on his entrepreneurial journey. Shingie’s resignation in 2007 came as a shock to his boss <br>who told him that he would be back after three months. But, th ree months turned into three years and later six  <br>years; now it has been nine years and still Shingie has not returned to that job. Resigning from a good job and <br>going full -time into entrepreneurship was hard to sell to his wife – he says it was the most di fficult sales pitch <br>of his life. Fortunately, he  got what he needed from her – her support. The rest was easy. Shingie believes that <br>creating a business is easy. Keeping it sustainable and relevant to the marketplace is the difficult part. It is for <br>this r eason that he has opted to focus on the three ou tfits he has.  <br>His first enterprise was Mandara Consulting Solutions (MCS) (http://www.mandaraconsulting.co.za ). This <br>business started in his bac k room (start small principle – TET Principle 1) . The business was a phenomenal <br>success, to such an extent that it was almost a victim of its own success. After an oversell in which Shingie 414 <br> had promised to Eskom he could deliver on a project, he found hims elf with a R1.2 million nightmare. He had <br>to loo k for this money.  <br>Bankers were laughing under the table even  though he had clinched a good deal. His prayers were answered <br>in the form of private finance he sourced from two gentlemen who later became his par tners in Mandara <br>Consulting Solutions. His partn ers complimented his skills set, but unfortunately did not share his vision. The <br>company enjoyed a good run and had many notable achievements. But with the challenges of partnerships and <br>divergent visions, Sh ingie parted ways amicably with his partners and  started his own ventures. This <br>experience taught Shingie that a businessperson has to have control of his cash flow if his business is to be <br>sustainable (TET principle 5).  <br>Armed with lessons from Mandara, Sh ingie founded Unathi Piping Pumps & Valves (PPV) . The company <br>was established to satisfy a market need for engineering consumables and most engineering buyers prefer to <br>buy from knowledgeable and reliable companies. The company has been in existence since 2009. It has done <br>work for numerous state -owned enterprises (SOEs) such as Eskom, Transnet, ACSA and municipalities. The <br>only weakness that Unathi PPV had was that it had a long cash flow cycle – usually three to four months. <br>Most of the work was project b ased and required a huge capital injection and t ook time to yield. The business <br>almost died from a cash flow suffocation with the increased demands from the clients (see TET principle 5).  <br>This gave birth to another business enterprise, Zandile Energy Solut ions (ZES), in 2010. This company <br>specialises in  fuels and lubricants and leverages on a number of suppliers in the market. It has been supplying <br>state departments with lubricants for their vehicle fleets for the past five years. The rationale for starting  ZES <br>(http://www.zandile -energy.co.za ) was to have a business unit that had a shorter cash flow pattern than Unathi <br>PPV. ZES’s clients pay in two -week cycles. This drastically improves the cash f low velocity of the two <br>companies. In an environ ment where cash is king, Shingie sought to improve his cash flow further by having <br>an enterprise in the fold with an even shorter cash flow. This needed a company that has fast -moving consumer <br>goods (FMCG), a s well as something about which he was fairly kn owledgeable. This could free up his focus <br>to allow him to concentrate on the high -yield enterprises. The business had to have a lower skills -base <br>requirement, with a hands -off approach. It had to provide repe at business.  <br>This thinking premise resulted in t he creation of First In Safety (FIS) (http://www.firstinsafety.co.za ). The <br>business supplies protective personnel equipment to the local industry. I t has an ecommerce platform and is <br>manned by a s ales agent driving the sales. The eplatform provides a Web presence that allows commerce <br>outside business hours to a global market. Sales come from as far as the DRC.  <br>The above -mentioned three companies (Unat hi PPV, ZES and FIS) cross -subsidise each other from a cash <br>flow perspective. Shingie has an accountant, Theresa, whose sole purpose is to manage the cash flow. The rest <br>of the team concentrates on operative issues. This complex boot strapping has ensured that the companies <br>always looked inwards for fun ding. The greatest challenge Shingie’s three businesses face is access to markets. <br>Nevertheless, he still soldiers on.  <br>Shingie says he also learnt a lot from his failures and urges that entrepreneurs should n ever be discouraged by <br>failure. After all, every  failed experience should be taken as a learning step. In line with his belief in  The seven <br>habits of highly effective people , Shingie has constantly sought to improve himself. In 2013, he enrolled for a <br>Mast er’s in Entrepreneurship from the Wits Business School. To him entrepreneurship is a lifestyle and a <br>career. To him business is not for the fainthearted, but for winners.  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 415 <br>  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>Annexure A  416
